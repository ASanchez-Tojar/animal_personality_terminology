Abstract = {{Correlations among behavioral traits can generate trade-offs and
   constrain phenotypic evolution. Interspecific hybridization has the
   potential to alter behavioral trait correlations, but the effect of
   hybridization on suites of behavioral traits has received relatively
   little attention. We evaluated how natural hybridization changes the
   relationship between boldness (time of emergence and proportion of time
   out of shelter) and response to a simulated predator threat in
   swordtails (Teleostei: Xiphophorus). In poeciliid fishes, bold
   individuals have increased survival in the presence of predators. This
   non-intuitive observation may arise as a result of bold individuals
   being more likely to engage in anti-predator behaviors. Contrary to our
   prediction, bold individuals were less likely to perform a fast-start
   response to a predator threat. This correlation was consistent among
   populations and species but was only significant in hybrids. The
   observed correlation between boldness and anti-predator behavior could
   impact hybrid fitness and the evolvability of hybrid lineages. More
   generally, our findings suggest that hybridization could influence the
   integration of behavioral phenotypes, as has been amply documented for
   morphology. Animal personality and behavioral syndromes could therefore
   play an important role in the evolutionary fate of natural hybrids}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate a sanctuary chimpanzee sample (N = 11) using two adapted
   human assessment instruments: the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and Eysenck's
   Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism (PEN) model. The former has been
   widely used in studies of animal personality, whereas the latter has
   never been used to assess chimpanzees. We asked familiar keepers and
   scientists (N = 28) to rate 38 (FFM) and 12 (PEN) personality items. The
   personality surveys showed reliability in all of the items for both
   instruments. These were then analyzed in a principal component analysis
   and a regularized exploratory factor analysis, which revealed four and
   three components, respectively. The results indicate that both
   questionnaires show a clear factor structure, with characteristic
   factors not just for the species, but also for the sample type. However,
   due to its brevity, the PEN may be more suitable for assessing
   personality in a sanctuary, where employees do not have much time to
   devote to the evaluation process. In summary, both models are sensitive
   enough to evaluate the personality of a group of chimpanzees housed in a
   sanctuary.}},

Abstract = {{There have been numerous empirical studies on the fitness consequences
   of behavioural syndromes in various animal taxa; however, the ecological
   and evolutionary implications on a population level are still poorly
   understood. To better understand these implications, we develop a
   non-linear age-structured mathematical model to qualitatively examine
   the evolutionary consequences of a heritable boldness personality trait
   within an animal population. We assume that this heritable boldness
   trait is positively correlated with boldness towards predators and
   intraspecific aggressiveness. This assumption leads to a
   growth/reproductive success versus mortality trade-off, which is
   thoroughly investigated and documented in the literature. Another
   life-history trade-off we include in the model is future versus current
   reproduction, which was shown by Wolf et al. {[}1] to be a possible
   mechanism for the evolution of behavioural syndromes within an animal
   population. The stability of the system is analysed, whereby the
   characteristic equation is in the form of a homogeneous Fredholm
   equation of the second kind which depends on both the perturbation and
   equilibrium solution. The system is found to be stable due to the
   competition between individuals of similar boldness acting as a negative
   feedback mechanism. Using numerical simulations we examine the
   qualitative features of the solution to the system. In particular, we
   investigate the interplay between the mutation and competition strength
   between two individuals with different boldness, whereby we find that an
   increasing competition range acts to push individuals to both extremes
   of the shy-bold axis, while an increasing mutation range counteracts
   this effect. This qualitative trait of aggregation of individuals around
   the shy and bold extremes is also found when examining different birth,
   mortality and competition functions.}},

Abstract = {{We Study the evolutionary effect of rare mutations causing global
   changes in traits. We consider asymmetric binary games between two
   players. The first player takes two alternative options with probability
   x and 1-x; and the second player takes options with probability y and
   1-y. Due to natural selection and recurrent mutation, the population
   evolves to have broad distributions of x and y. We analyze three cases
   showing qualitatively different dynamics, exemplified by (1)
   vigilance-intrusion game, (2) asymmetric hawk-dove game and (3)
   cleaner-client game. We found that the evolutionary outcome is strongly
   dependent upon the distribution of mutants' traits, more than the
   mutation rates. For example in the vigilance-intrusion game, the
   evolutionary dynamics show a perpetual stable oscillation if mutants are
   always close to the parent (local-mutation mode), whilst the population
   converges to a stable equilibrium distribution if mutants can be quite
   different from the parent (global-mutation mode), even for extremely low
   mutation rate. When common local mutations and rare global mutations
   occur simultaneously, the evolutionary outcome is controlled by the
   latter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are currently many studies on the personality of non-human
   primates and other animals. These include a variety of species as well
   as different research lines and methodologies, ranging in scope from
   informal reports and single case studies to well-designed research.
   In addition to the need to demonstrate that primate personality exists
   as a legitimate study subject, extensive reviews on this topic show that
   the objective of most of the research performed in primates is centered
   on the description of personality dimensions, the measurement of
   personality traits, and their correlation with several biological,
   social and even ecological variables, and has used structural
   personality methodology. This method analyzes information from many
   interrelated variables, where two or more highly correlated traits
   reflect the existence of a personality dimension. This method has been
   used in the construction of ``instruments{''} that evaluate human and
   animal personality, and has demonstrated its usefulness in basic
   personality research such as the correlation of biological, genetic, and
   social variables with personality traits, as well a the study of
   individual, cultural, and comparative variability.
   By using human models as a parameter, some authors have concluded that
   personality research in non-human primates complies with the criteria to
   be considered feasible. Studies have shown that there is an empirical
   relation between personality and behavior. For example, there is a
   positive correlation between the sociability dimension of personality in
   rhesus macaques and their affiliative behavior scores. Also, that most
   of the rating instruments used have shown good inter- and intra-observer
   agreement; finally, that trait ratings have been useful in predicting
   behavioral and even physiological outcomes; for example, a relationship
   between dominance and testosterone levels.
   Finally, in this report we also describe the most adequate methodology
   proposed in the literature for the study of primate personality: the
   combined use of both ethological coding and trait rating. A brief
   description of the most commonly used instruments is provided, along
   with some of the findings generated by such instruments. For example,
   the Battery of 25 Adjectives, used by several research groups, has shown
   the influence of both mothers and alpha males, personality on their
   infants, or the relation between personality and age, sex and hierarchy.
   Other groups have used reactivity scales to evaluate temperament, while
   still others have used the Emotions Profile Index (or a variation) to
   evaluate the distribution of emotions among a primate group. More
   recently, several groups have implemented human personality instruments
   in primate studies such as the Five Factor Model, finding that other
   dimensions are added when evaluating other species; for example,
   dominance, when applied to gorillas or chimpanzees. The use of this
   model has also allowed for the organization and integration of many
   other studies.
   Animal research already plays an important role in the development of
   psychology. Learning, perception and even psychopathology have profited
   from it. The growing interest in primate personality and the recent
   efforts to integrate the diverse research lines developed until now,
   suggest the short-term possibility of using animal personality research
   as a useful tool in the understanding of genetic, biological and
   ecological influences of human personality.}},

Title = {{Temperature preference of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) juveniles
   induces spontaneous sex reversal}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an African freshwater fish that
   displays a genetic sex determination system (XX vertical bar XY) where
   high temperatures (above 32 degrees C to 36.5 degrees C) induce
   masculinization. In Nile tilapia, the thermosensitive period was
   reported from 10 to 30 days post fertilization. In their natural
   environment, juveniles may encounter high temperatures that are above
   the optimal temperature for growth (27-30 degrees C). The relevance of
   the thermal sex reversal mechanism in a natural context remains unclear.
   The main objective of our study is to determine whether sexually
   undifferentiated juveniles spontaneously prefer higher, unfavorable
   temperatures and whether this choice skews the sex ratio toward males.
   Five full-sib progenies (from 100\% XX crosses) were subjected to (1) a
   horizontal three-compartment thermal step gradient (thermal continuum 28
   degrees C-32 degrees C-36.5 degrees C) during the thermosensitive
   period, (2) a control continuum (28 degrees C-28 degrees C-28 degrees C)
   and (3) a thermal control tank (36.5 degrees C). During the first days
   of the treatment, up to an average of 20\% of the population preferred
   the masculinizing compartment of the thermal continuum (36.5 degrees C)
   compared to the control continuum. During the second part of the
   treatment, juveniles preferred the lower, nonmasculinizing 32 degrees C
   temperature. This short exposure to higher temperatures was sufficient
   to significantly skew the sex ratio toward males, compared to congeners
   raised at 28 degrees C (from 5.0 +/- 6.7\% to 15.6 +/- 16.5\% of males).
   The proportion of males was significantly different in the thermal
   continuum, thermal control tank and control continuum, and it was
   positively correlated among populations. Our study shows for the first
   time that Nile tilapia juveniles can choose a masculinizing temperature
   during a short period of time. This preference is sufficient to induce
   sex reversal to males within a population. For the first time, behavior
   is reported as a potential player in the sex determination mechanism of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in movement are widely
   recognised across taxa. In addition, foraging plasticity at the
   within-individual level suggests a behavioural dependency on the
   internal energy demand. Because behaviour co-varies with fast-slow life
   history (LH) strategies in an adaptive context, as theoretically
   predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, mass/energy fluxes
   should link behaviour and its plasticity with physiology at both
   between- and within-individual levels. However, a mechanistic framework
   driving these links in a fluctuating ecological context is lacking.
   Focusing on home range behaviour, we propose a novel
   behavioural-bioenergetics theoretical model to address such complexities
   at the individual level based on energy balance. We propose explicit
   mechanistic links between behaviour, physiology/metabolism and LH by
   merging two well-founded theories, the movement ecology paradigm and the
   dynamic energetic budget theory. Overall, our behavioural-bioenergetics
   model integrates the mechanisms explaining how (1) behavioural between-
   and within-individual variabilities connect with internal state variable
   dynamics, (2) physiology and behaviour are explicitly interconnected by
   mass/energy fluxes, and (3) different LHs may arise from both
   behavioural and physiological variabilities in a given ecological
   context. Our novel theoretical model reveals encouraging opportunities
   for empiricists and theoreticians to delve into the eco-evolutionary
   processes that favour or hinder the development of between-individual
   differences in behaviour and the evolution of personality-dependent
   movement syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in coping with environmental challenges is a
   well-known phenomenon across vertebrates, including teleost fish.
   Dopamine is the major transmitter in the brain reward networks, and
   important for motivational processes and stress coping. Functions of the
   endogenous opioid system are not well studied in teleosts. However, in
   mammals the activity in the brain reward networks is regulated by the
   endogenous opioid system. This study aimed at investigating if there was
   a correlation between risk-taking behavior and the expression of
   dopamine and opioid receptors in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain.
   Risk-taking behavior was assessed in a novel tank diving test, and the
   most extreme high risk taking, i.e. bold, and low risk taking, i.e. shy,
   fish were sampled for qPCR analysis of whole brain gene expression. The
   expression analysis showed a significantly higher expression of the
   dopamine D2 receptors (drd2a and drd2b) and the delta opioid receptor
   (DOR; oprd1b) in bold compared to shy fish. Besides reward and
   reinforcing properties, DORs are also involved in emotional responses.
   Dopamine D2 receptors are believed to be important for active stress
   coping in rodents, and taken together the results of the current study
   suggest similar functions in zebrafish. However, additional experiments
   are required to clarify how dopamine and opioid receptor activation
   affect behavior and stress coping in this species.}},

Title = {{Life-history evolution under fluctuating density-dependent selection and
   the adaptive alignment of pace-of-life syndromes}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{230-247}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel perspective on life-history evolution that combines
   recent theoretical advances in fluctuating density-dependent selection
   with the notion of pace-of-life syndromes (POLSs) in behavioural
   ecology. These ideas posit phenotypic co-variation in life-history,
   physiological, morphological and behavioural traits as a continuum from
   the highly fecund, short-lived, bold, aggressive and highly dispersive
   `fast' types at one end of the POLS to the less fecund, long-lived,
   cautious, shy, plastic and socially responsive `slow' types at the
   other. We propose that such variation in life histories and the
   associated individual differences in behaviour can be explained through
   their eco-evolutionary dynamics with population density - a single and
   ubiquitous selective factor that is present in all biological systems.
   Contrasting regimes of environmental stochasticity are expected to
   affect population density in time and space and create differing
   patterns of fluctuating density-dependent selection, which generates
   variation in fast versus slow life histories within and among
   populations. We therefore predict that a major axis of phenotypic
   co-variation in life-history, physiological, morphological and
   behavioural traits (i.e. the POLS) should align with these stochastic
   fluctuations in the multivariate fitness landscape created by variation
   in density-dependent selection. Phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic
   (co-)variation oriented along this major POLS axis are thus expected to
   facilitate rapid and adaptively integrated changes in various aspects of
   life histories within and among populations and/or species. The
   fluctuating density-dependent selection POLS framework presented here
   therefore provides a series of clear testable predictions, the
   investigation of which should further our fundamental understanding of
   life-history evolution and thus our ability to predict natural
   population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Operational police horses must perform under challenging circumstances,
   so the selection of suitable equine training candidates should include
   an evaluation of their personalities. We describe the developmental
   phase of a project aimed at customizing selection tests for mounts at
   the Belgian Federal Police. The experiment evaluated the influence of
   preceding activity and multiple testing on behavior during personality
   tests. Using a crossover design, three different preceding activities
   were compared: straight out of their box, after 30 minutes tied outside
   alone, and after 30 minutes alone in a paddock. A sample of 30 active
   police horses was tested, in three equal groups with a different
   treatment order per group. The personality tests included an arena and a
   sudden object test, measuring behavioral responses. For the sudden
   object test, we also recorded distance from a descending umbrella.
   Likert scores of 1 to 5 were used to score the ease of handling when
   leading the horse into and out of the arena. Order and treatment effects
   were analyzed with mixed models. Treatment effects were found in the
   arena test for 10 of 17 variables, including all measures of stand,
   canter and roll, and buck/jump rate. Order effects were present for
   stand rate in the arena and sudden object test, for rate and mean bout
   length of walk in the sudden object test, and for the scores of release
   at entering the arena and approach at the end of the testing. After all
   horses had been tested individually, 10 horses from the current sample
   were tested as duos, after coming straight out of their boxes (stables)
   to evaluate the effect of solitary testing and the influence of equine
   company as it prevails in the workplace. A Wilcoxon signed rank test
   that compared the duo results to those of the individual tests for the
   same treatment, showed a significant difference in only two of 52
   variables (stand mean bout length in the arena test and Likert score for
   entering the arena and stopping). Conversely, only five variables had
   significant Spearman correlations between both tests (arena test: mean
   bout length of trot; sudden object test: stand rate, next rate, and next
   percentage; Likert score for lead out when leaving the arena). Overall,
   these results indicate a limited influence of multiple testing, but a
   strong effect of preceding activity on the arena test. The comparison
   between solo and duo testing will require more research. (C) 2018

   do not correlate with their behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{105-114}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Living in a seasonally changing environment requires periodic,
   reversible changes in animals' phenotypes to match variations in their
   abiotic and biotic environments. These changes may relate to temperature
   regulation, torpor use, basal metabolic rate, body mass or behaviour,
   all acting in concert to ensure the best adjustment to the environmental
   challenges. As winter approaches, many small mammals develop a winter
   phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a
   summer one. However, there is a significant within-population
   polymorphism in winter phenotype. We hypothesized that winter phenotype
   is correlated with consistent between-individual differences in animal
   behaviour, i.e. animal personality, and energy metabolism. We measured
   basal metabolic rate (BMR) and behavioural traits in three winter
   phenotypes of Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, which were
   acclimated to summer-like and then to winter-like conditions: fully
   responding, nonresponding and partially responding to a short
   photoperiod. We found no differences in behavioural traits between
   hamsters of different winter phenotypes, but the seasonal increase in
   activity was lowest in full responders indicating their lower
   behavioural flexibility than partial responders and nonresponders. The
   same was true for BMR. While nonresponders and partial responders
   increased their BMR from summer to winter, full responders did not
   change it. We argue that different winter phenotypes are maintained in
   the population because they could be beneficial under different
   environmental conditions. We also suggest that within a population there
   is a continuum of winter phenotypes, which is not related to differences
   in animal personalities. This continuum allows for population
   maintenance despite environmental conditions changing over short and
   long timescales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Salmonid fish are an ecologically important and extensively studied
   group of fish which concern many interest groups in our society. The aim
   of this paper is to discuss and suggest solutions to the multifaceted
   problems associated with studying behavioural variation in salmonids,
   with focus on designing behavioural studies that are ecologically
   relevant. Many of the general problems and solutions discussed can be
   applied to other animals as well. First, the importance of asking clear
   questions when conceiving behavioural studies is addressed, using
   Tinbergen's four questions and associated theories as stepping stones
   towards generating testable hypotheses about behavioural variation. We
   then address a range of methodological challenges encountered when
   attempting to study behavioural variation in salmonids and suggest
   solutions to overcome these problems. A range of approaches is
   discussed, from highly controllable laboratory experiments to monitoring
   studies of behaviour in the wild. The importance of combining lab- and
   field approaches to evaluate the ecological relevance of behavioural
   variation is highlighted. Finally, we suggest a general framework using
   a multi-faceted research approach to address questions about the
   behavioural ecology of salmonids (and other animals) so that knowledge
   can progress, and the ecological relevance of behavioural studies can be
   validated.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals behave differently from one another, especially when
   confronting challenges such as changes in diet (e.g. weaning),
   environment (e.g. moving from pasture to feedlot) and social grouping
   (e.g. movement to lactating group after parturition). Each of these
   challenges involves some element of novelty, impacting the welfare and
   productivity of the animal. Indeed, the large individual variability in
   the development and expression of feeding behaviour cannot be fully
   explained by differences in genetics, management practices, body size or
   growth rate. In this review we outline evidence that individual
   variability in feeding behaviour is associated with the personality of
   the individual. We focus on three key personality traits: exploration,
   fear or reactivity and sociability. Individuals differ in how much they
   explore their feeding environment, with more exploratory individuals
   being less reactive to novel situations. Feeding behaviour can be
   impaired in individuals that are especially reactive to a change in
   their environment, change in diet or handling or restraint by humans.
   The social environment is also a major factor affecting how individuals
   express their behaviour. Sociability of the individual, including
   dominant-subordinate and affiliative relationships, affects how
   individuals make foraging decisions, gain access to feed and adopt
   particular social strategies to maintain or adjust feeding patterns when
   the social environment changes. Personality traits such as exploration,
   boldness and sociability also affect the use of social information when
   learning where, how or what to eat. Our review highlights the
   implications of feeding behaviour variability for the welfare and
   productivity of the individual, and how an understanding of personality
   can help tailor management to the needs of the individual.}},

Title = {{Independence between coping style and stress reactivity in plateau pika}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The concept of coping style represents the way individual animals react
   to a stressful situation, both behaviourally and neurophysiologically.
   Over the last decades coping style has been linked to the development of
   research on animal personality. Based on this concept, we should find a
   proactive-reactive continuum in animal populations, with proactive
   individuals being fast explorer, bold, aggressive, and show high
   sympathetic reactivity (higher heart rate), as well as low
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (PHA) axis reactivity to external
   stressor (higher plasma glucocorticoid level). At the other extreme,
   shy, lowly aggressive, reactive individuals should be slow in their
   exploration, and show a low sympathetic reactivity and a high HPA axis
   reactivity. However, a recent two-tier model proposed that coping style
   and stress reactivity should be independent of each other. In this
   study, we tested the two-tier model in a wild plateau pika (Ochotona
   curzoniae) population on the Tibetan Plateau, by quantifying the
   associations between several behavioural and physiological traits at the
   among- and within-individual levels. We repeatedly measured exploration,
   docility, boldness, heart rate and plasma cortisol concentration in
   individuals between April and September of 2013. All traits tested were
   repeatable. At the among-individual level, all behavioural traits were
   correlated with each other and with heart rate, but were independent of
   both basal level and variation of plasma cortisol concentration. Most
   correlations were negligible at the within-individual level. In support
   of the two-tier model, these results suggest that coping style (i.e.
   behaviour and heart rate associations) is independent of stress
   reactivity (i.e. glucocorticoid reactivity) in that species.}},

Abstract = {{The coexistence of ectothermic species is enabled among other factors by
   the differentiation of their thermal niches. While this phenomenon is
   well described from deep temperate lakes, it is unclear whether the same
   pattern applies to temporary pools. In this study, we examined
   fundamental thermal niches in three coexisting annual killifish species
   Nothobranchius furzeri, N. orthonotus and N. pienaari from temporary
   pools in southern Mozambique. We hypothesized that the disparate thermal
   requirements of the three congeneric species are a candidate niche
   component that facilitates their local coexistence. We estimated
   species' thermal requirements as preferred body temperatures (T-pref) in
   a horizontal thermal gradient. Under thermal gradient conditions,
   sympatric killifish maintained their body temperatures within similar
   T-pref ranges despite some variation in mean T-pref. The daily variation
   in water temperature in their native habitats enables killifish to
   thermoregulate at least for part of the diurnal cycle. We conclude that
   the coexistence of African annual killifish species is possible without
   the differentiation of their fundamental thermal niches.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Prior work has described a link between an individual's metabolic rate
   and a willingness to take risks. One context in which high metabolic
   rates and risk-prone behaviors may prove to be maladaptive is in fish
   that strike fishing lures only to be captured by anglers. It has been
   shown that metabolic phenotype may be altered by angling; however,
   little work has assessed metabolic rate in fish and its relationship to
   angling vulnerability in a realistic angling trial. To address this, we
   subjected a set of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque,
   1819) to a series of angling sessions. Following this, a subset of 23
   fish that had been captured at least once and 25 fish that had not been
   captured were assessed for metabolic phenotype (standard and maximum
   metabolic rates, postexercise oxygen consumption, and recovery time) via
   intermittent flow respirometry. Contrary to predictions, captured and
   uncaptured fish did not differ in any measurement of metabolic rate.
   These results suggest that metabolic phenotype is not a determinant of
   angling vulnerability within the studied context. It is possible,
   therefore, that previously described alterations in metabolic phenotype
   owing to angling pressure may be context-specific and may not apply to
   all species and angling contexts.}},

Title = {{On the usage of single measurements in behavioural ecology research on
   individual differences}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{99-105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Since the early 21st century, behavioural ecologists have increasingly
   focused on the ecology and evolution of repeatable individual
   differences in behaviour (aka `animal personality'). More and more
   studies have investigated correlations between behaviour(s) and other
   phenotypic traits, thereby seeking to understand among-individual
   variation in behaviour from either a proximate or an ultimate
   perspective. Statistically, such studies require the estimation of
   among-individual correlations, necessitating study designs where suites
   of labile traits are repeatedly assayed. Most published studies, by
   contrast, instead assume that among-individual correlations can be
   approximated using data of suites of phenotypic traits measured only
   once. Such studies take an `individual gambit' as they assume that
   phenotypic correlations between two traits measured once match
   among-individual correlations. A literature survey shows that this
   assumption was made in 62\% of empirical studies; this is a worrying
   trend as a mismatch between the research question and the study (or
   statistical) design can lead to biased conclusions about biological
   patterns. In this paper we use a visual approach to illustrate these
   concerns for a broad audience, thereby complementing previous papers
   using a jargon more suitable for the statistically oriented. We thereby
   seek to reiterate the notion that reliable answers to any scientific
   question require specific types of data. While this commentary
   underlines the importance of spelling out key assumptions in discussions
   of (suboptimal) data in scientific papers on individuality, our main
   message is that researchers should typically be able to avoid publishing
   studies with conclusions heavily hinging on unverifiable assumptions.
   This is because researchers normally have the freedom to decide a priori
   to focus their research towards questions for which appropriate data can
   arguably be collected. Doing so would greatly facilitate our ability to
   robustly address key questions of biological interest, such as the
   ecology and evolution of individuality. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of animal groups may be different and predictable

   live in social groups and collectively defend gardens of palatable

   corals because farmerfish mob corallivores that attempt to forage on
   corals within these gardens. We detected large among-colony differences
   in farmerfish collective aggression towards intruder fish that persisted
   across years. We further found that the territories of aggressive groups
   and territories containing larger farmerfish provided greater protection
   to corals: territories of aggressive groups naturally harbored more
   branching corals than nonaggressive groups, and experimentally
   outplanted branching corals experienced 80\% less skeletal loss and grew
   larger over 25 weeks in aggressive territories than in nonaggressive
   territories. These findings hint that factors that increase farmerfish
   group aggressiveness (e.g., higher temperatures) could enhance the
   protective value of farmerfish territories for the replenishment of

   framework suggests that behavioral types may also differ consistently in
   their cognitive style. Accordingly, we propose that cognition could be
   further incorporated into the POLS framework comprised of behavioral and
   thermal physiological traits. Under this premise, fast behavioral types
   having high thermal traits are predicted to acquire a novel task faster
   but at the cost of accuracy while slow behavioral types with low thermal
   traits would be more attentive, responding to cues at a slower rate
   leading to higher accuracy and flexibility. This was tested by measuring
   physiological and behavioral traits in delicate skinks (Lampropholis
   delicata) and testing their learning ability. Correlations were detected
   between cognition and behavior but not thermal physiology. Contrary to
   our predictions, individual positioning along these axes opposed our
   predicted directions along the fast-slow continuum. Fast lizards
   preferring lower body temperatures expressed higher activity,
   exploration, sociality, and boldness levels, and learned the
   discrimination learning task at a slower rate but made the most errors.
   Additionally, modelling results indicated that neither thermal
   physiology, behavior, or their interaction influenced cognitive
   performance. Although the small number of animals completing the final
   stages of the learning assays limits the strength of these findings.
   Thus, we propose that future research involving a greater sample size
   and number of trials be conducted so as to enhance our understanding
   into how the integration of cognitive style, behavior, and physiology
   may influence individual fitness within natural populations.}},

Title = {{`Love at first sight': The effect of personality and colouration
   patterns in the reproductive success of zebrafish (Danio rerio)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Individual differences in animal personality and external appearance
   such as colouration patterns have both been extensively studied
   separately. A significant body of research has explored many of
   pertinent ecological and biological aspects that can be affected by them
   and their impact upon fitness. Currently little is known about how both
   factors interact and their effect on reproductive success. In this
   study, we evaluated two major parameters contributing to the fitness of
   the species: reproduction and offspring survival. We selected two
   different phenotypes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) selected by their
   colouration patterns: phenotype 1) named Wild type, UAB line (WT-UAB)
   with a homogeneous colouration pattern (clear and defined lateral
   stripes) and phenotype 2) Wild type indefinite (WT-I) had a
   heterogeneous colouration pattern and different degrees of lateral
   stripe definition. All animals were also screened for personality. We
   then compared their reproductive success (spawning rate) and offspring
   survival at different stages, from egg to larvae, and for 2 successive
   generations (parental generation was G0; First and second generations
   were G1 and G2 respectively). Our results show that personality traits
   were the main source of variability between the fitness components
   measured: both personalities had similar total numbers of eggs spawned
   but proactive animals, for both colour phenotypes, had higher
   reproductive success. This was reflected in a higher percentage of
   spawning viability at 1day post fertilization (dpf), higher total
   survival and growth rates at larval stages. Proactive phenotypes from
   WT-UAB population had a higher overall fitness in comparison to the
   other phenotypes studied. Our findings imply that fitness of this
   species when kept under similar husbandry conditions is significantly
   influenced by parental personality and not by their external appearance.
   Under these conditions the reproductive success is enhanced. The
   implications of this study are important for zebrafish breeding and
   husbandry in captivity and are relevant toward understanding the
   underlying drivers of trait selection in natural environments.}},

Title = {{Personality, abnormal behaviour, and health: An evaluation of the
   welfare of police horses}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{An animal's welfare depends on an individual's capacity to adapt to the
   environment in which it lives. This adaptation is directly associated
   with the quality of the environment and to the possibility of expressing
   natural behaviours. Horses kept in stables often display a range of
   abnormal behaviours related to lack of control over their environment,
   which can lead to behavioural and health problems. An individual's
   personality also plays an important role in its susceptibility and
   resilience to the development of diseases and abnormal behaviour; thus,
   an evaluation of horses' personalities could be crucial to selecting
   individuals best able to cope with different work activities. This study
   aimed to assess the well-being of police horses maintained in a
   semi-confinement regime in Brazil by associating their personalities to
   the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and disease. Using a non-invasive
   approach, different tests were performed to investigate the horses'
   behaviour, personality and welfare. A frustration test and a novel
   object test were conducted with 46 horses and the individuals'
   personalities were assessed using questionnaires and behaviour tests. In
   addition, we evaluated their physical health through a survey of their
   veterinary records. The data for horses were evaluated individually. The
   results demonstrated the occurrence of multiple abnormal behaviours
   motivated by factors such as diet and lack of social contact. Moreover,
   the personality tests indicated this is an important component when
   evaluating welfare, since correlations were found between personality
   traits and abnormal behaviour expression, and between personality traits
   and health problems. According to our results, passive, stubborn, and
   confident horses are better suited to be selected as police horses. The
   ability to classify horses according to their personalities could help
   in selecting horses most suitable for patrolling, thereby helping to
   reduce behavioural problems and increasing animal well-being.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Movement activity levels of wild animals often differ consistently among
   individuals, reflecting different behavioral types. Previous studies
   have shown that laboratory-scored activity can predict several
   ecologically relevant characteristics. In an experiment on wild brown
   trout Salmo trutta, spanning from June to October, we investigated how
   spring swimming activity, measured in a standardized laboratory test,
   related to relative recapture probability in autumn. Based on laboratory
   activity scores, individuals clustered into 2 groups, which showed
   contrasting patterns in the size-dependency of their recapture
   probability. Size had a slightly positive effect on recapture
   probability for passive fish but a clear negative effect on active fish.
   Our results show that the population structure in a cohort, in terms of
   relative proportions of behavioral types in different size classes, can
   vary over time. The results of this study could depend on either
   selective mortality or migration. However, selective disappearance of
   individuals with specific phenotypes, regardless of the mechanism, will
   have implications for trout population management, such as stocking
   efficiency of hatchery fish with high growth rates or maintenance of
   fishways past migration barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Although growing evidence supports the idea that animal personality can
   explain plasticity in response to changes in the social environment, it
   remains to be tested whether it can explain spatial responses of
   individuals in the face of natural environmental fluctuations. This is a
   major challenge in ecology and evolution as spatial dynamics link
   individual- and population-level processes. In this study, we
   investigated the potential of individual personalities to predict
   differences in fish behaviour in the wild. Specifically, our goal was to
   answer if individual differences in plasticity of space use to sea
   surface temperature could be explained by differences in personality
   along the reactive-proactive axis. To address this question, we first
   conducted repeated standard laboratory assays (i.e., open-field test,
   novel object test and mirror stimulation test) to assess the personality
   type of 76 wild-caught Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Next, we released
   the fish back into the sea and monitored their spatial behaviour over
   large temporal (16months) and spatial (a whole fjord) scales, using
   high-resolution acoustic tracking. We demonstrate that (a) cod
   personality traits are structured into a proactive-reactive syndrome
   (proactive fish being more bold, exploratory and aggressive), (b) mean
   depth use of individuals is mainly driven by sea temperature and (c)
   personality is a significant predictor of home range changes in the
   wild, where reactive, but not proactive, individuals reduced their home
   range as sea temperature increased. These findings expand our
   understanding of the ecological consequences of animal personality and
   the mechanisms shaping spatial dynamics of animals in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Studies about personalities in wild animals usually focus on five
   categories of behavioral traits that do not easily accommodate all
   aspects of parental care, a class of behaviors with direct consequence
   to reproductive success. Parental care can vary consistently between
   individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the
   consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding
   seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern
   Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest
   defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these
   first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according
   to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and
   aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except
   exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We
   also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an
   important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can
   arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a
   consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that,
   depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent,
   suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care
   allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest
   defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed
   the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the
   mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications
   of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking
   parenting styles to fitness in swallow species.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in the behavior of prey can influence predation
   risk in complex ways. We ran individual roach (Rutilus rutilus), a
   common freshwater fish, through a standard refuge emergence protocol to
   characterize their boldness, a key animal personality trait. We then
   paired a bold and a shy roach and exposed the pair to one of two
   predator species that have contrasting hunting modes to ascertain how
   personality traits shaped their survival during predator encounters.
   When a paired bold and shy prey fish interacted with a perch predator
   (active foraging mode), bold and shy prey were consumed in almost equal
   numbers. However, pike predators (ambush foraging mode) selectively
   consumed more shy prey, and prey body size and boldness score both
   contributed significantly to which prey fish was eaten. Our findings
   support the idea that multiple predators with different foraging modes,
   and hence differential selection on prey personality, could contribute
   to maintaining variation in personality in prey populations.
   Furthermore, for social species, including shoaling fish, the ultimate
   consequences of an individual's personality may depend upon the
   personality of its nearby conspecifics.
   Animals of the same species often look similar, but individuals show
   differences in their behavior that can have important consequences, for
   instance when these individuals interact with predators. The common
   roach is a freshwater fish that shows inter-individual variation in its
   propensity to take risks, a key personality trait often termed boldness.
   Variation in boldness may affect the outcome when roach interact with
   predators, i.e., if they get eaten or survive. However, we found the
   impact of roachs' personality type depends on what species of predatory
   fish they face. When we put a shy and a bold roach together with
   predatory perch, the roachs' personality did not significantly affect
   which individual was eaten. But when the predator was a pike, the
   predators selectively ate more shy roach, and the likelihood an
   individual would be eaten depended on their body size.}},

Title = {{Mind the trap: large-scale field experiment shows that trappability is
   not a proxy for personality}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural tendencies vary consistently among individuals and this
   variation is known as personality. Previous studies have found that
   personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests
   predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the
   nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only
   within single species and never across environments. This is problematic
   because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between
   seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link
   because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy
   for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this
   would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term
   capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we
   designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and
   trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct
   forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189
   deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes
   gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland
   jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews,
   Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target
   species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality
   traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore,
   trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap
   happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the
   trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used
   as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Variation in behavioral traits among individuals within a population can
   have implications for food webs and ecosystems. Temperature change also
   alters food web structure and function, but potential interactions
   between warming and intraspecific behavioral variation are largely
   unexplored. We aimed to test how increased temperature, individual
   activity level of a predatory backswimmer (Anisops assimilis), and their
   interaction influenced the strength of top-down control of zooplankton
   and phytoplankton. We used stable isotopes to support our assumption
   that the study population of A.assimilis is zooplanktivorous, and
   behavioral trials to confirm that activity level is a repeatable trait.
   We established freshwater microcosms to test for effects of warming,
   backswimmer presence, and backswimmer behavioral type on zooplankton
   density, zooplankton composition, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.
   Top-down control was present and was generally stronger at increased
   temperature. There was no indication that predator behavioral type
   influenced the strength of top-down control either on its own or
   interactively with temperature. Predator behavioral type may not be
   associated with ecologically important function in this species at the
   temporal and spatial scales addressed in this study, but the links
   between behavior, temperature, and food web processes are worthy of
   broader exploration.}},

Title = {{The importance of group vocal behaviour in roost finding}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{157-164}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals benefit from socially acquired information to avoid
   predation risks and enhance foraging efficiency. Spix's disc-winged
   bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their
   need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two
   contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls,
   produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats
   within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal
   behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more
   vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent
   individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time
   required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated
   with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting
   a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social
   groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either
   frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling
   rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new
   roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show
   that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost
   called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search
   time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to
   predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more
   roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the
   relevance of more vocal individuals for the group. Our work represents a
   step in understanding the importance of communication and individual
   vocal behaviour in group formation and stability in gregarious animals.

Abstract = {{Animal personality traits are defined as consistent individual
   differences in behavior over time and across contexts. Occasionally this
   inflexibility results in maladaptive behavioral responses to external
   stimuli. However, in social groups inflexible behavioral phenotypes
   might be favored as this could lead to more predictable social
   interactions. Two hypotheses seek to describe the optimal distribution
   of personality types within groups. The social niche specialization
   hypothesis states that individuals within groups should partition social
   roles, like personality types, to avoid conflict; whereas the conformity
   hypothesis states that individuals should assort with conspecifics of
   similar personality. However, no research so far has compared these
   hypotheses using data from wild animal systems. We tested boldness in
   the wild on 2 species with different social systems, the Mexican Jay and
   California Scrub-Jay. We found support for the conformity hypothesis
   over the social niche specialization hypothesis because individuals
   within groups of the social species had more similar personalities, and
   consequently there was a statistically significant group effect. The
   most likely mechanism for this conformity is social learning of
   behaviors through development, but more explicit research on this is
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat choice has broad repercussions for animals, but mechanisms
   influencing such choices are generally not understood. When conducting
   conservation translocations using captive-reared animals, elucidating
   mechanisms influencing habitat preference pre-release could inform
   rearing methods and post-release behavior. We raised 32 captive-born
   eastern box turtles (Terrapene earolina) for eight months-16 in
   naturalistic enriched enclosures and 16 in unenriched enclosures. We
   then let each turtle choose between environments simulating both rearing
   conditions in a novel enclosure to evaluate the hypothesis that rearing
   environment influences habitat selection. Preference for the enriched
   environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81,
   95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95\%
   CI: 0.62-0.98) turtles. Those that chose the enriched habitat (n = 27)
   did so in less than half the time (7 = 504.8 s, 95\% CI: 266.49-743.04)
   than those that selected the unenriched one (n = 5, X = 1339.0 s, 95\%
   CI: 783.84-1894.07, P = 0.009). Selection latency did not differ between
   rearing treatments (P = 0.871). We conducted a second experiment to
   clarify if preferences were based on familiarity or novelty by using the
   same enclosure, but we gave individuals a choice between the habitat
   representing their rearing condition and a novel object (empty tissue
   box). Preference for respective rearing environment was exhibited by
   enriched (selection probability = 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.98) and
   unenriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96)
   individuals. Selection latency did not differ based on side chosen (P =
   0.439) or rearing treatment (P = 0.764). Selection latency was
   repeatable by individuals (R = 0.47, 90\% CI = 0.24-0.71, P = 0.003),
   and this personality trait may be heritable since it was also repeatable
   by clutch mates (R = 0.36, 90\% CI = 0.03-0.62, P = 0.001). Preference
   for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles
   appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior
   experience. Housing this species in enriched enclosures should increase
   welfare. Moreover, our collective findings highlight the importance of
   evaluating how intrinsic effects could affect translocation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating the repeatability of trait variation between individuals,
   that is the amount of individual variation in relation to overall
   phenotypic variation, indicates an upper level of heritability and
   reveals whether a given trait may be subject to selection. Labile traits
   are characterized by high levels of flexibility and consequently low
   trait repeatability is expected. Indeed, research examining
   glucocorticoid levels in various non-mammal species found low
   repeatability scores. However, mammals may be different in this respect
   as (i) differential maternal care early in life has the potential to
   prime hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and (ii) allelic
   variation affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning has
   been reported. Individuals often differ from each other in average
   and/or plastic labile trait expression, two aspects that can be
   described using a reaction norm approach. Both consistent and flexible
   reaction norm expression has been argued to serve adaptive purposes,
   depending on the stability and predictability of environmental
   conditions. Here, we investigated both trait and reaction norm
   repeatability of urinary cortisol levels in wild adult male chimpanzees.
   To capture the expression of the circadian urinary cortisol rhythm of
   individual males over time, urine samples were collected throughout the
   day. In total data of 30 males collected over a period of 8 years were
   included in the dataset. No male was sampled over the whole 8-year
   period however. We found minor levels of trait repeatability but
   considerable reaction norm repeatability. This implies a minor role of
   genetic or priming factors on cortisol excretion, but reveals that males
   differ consistently in average urinary cortisol levels and the shape of
   the circadian urinary cortisol rhythm. Relating these results to fitness
   parameters will provide answers to questions on the adaptive value of
   reaction norm repeatability of this labile hormonal trait in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Trait-based community ecology promises an understanding of the factors
   that determine species abundances and distributions across habitats.
   However, ecologists are often faced with large suites of potentially
   important traits, making generalizations across ecosystems and species
   difficult or even impossible. Here, we hypothesize that key traits
   structuring ecological communities may be causally dependent on common
   physiological mechanisms and that elucidating these mechanisms can help
   us understand the distributions of traits and species across habitats.
   We test this hypothesis by investigating putatively causal relationships
   between physiological and behavioral traits at the species and community
   levels in larvae of 17 species of dragonfly that co-occur at the
   landscape scale but segregate among lakes. We use tools borrowed from
   phenotypic selection analyses to show that physiological traits underlie
   activity rate, which has opposing effects on foraging and predator
   avoidance behaviors. The effect of activity on these behaviors
   ultimately shapes species distributions and community composition in
   habitats with either large-bodied fish or invertebrates as top
   predators. Remarkably, despite the inherent complexity of ecological
   communities, the expression of just two biomolecules accounts for a high
   proportion of the variation in behavioral traits and hence, dragonfly
   community composition between habitats. We suggest that causal
   relationships among traits can drive species distributions and community
   assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Ontogeny of animal personality is still an open question. Testing
   whether personality traits correlated with state variables (e.g.
   metabolic rate, hormones) and/or life history traits, and which ones are
   involved, requires more empirical studies. Insects with metamorphosis
   represent a good opportunity to tackle this question. Because of the
   various degrees of internal (physiological, nervous) and environmental
   changes linked to metamorphosis they allow testing whether these
   modifications drive consistency in personality traits between immature
   and adult stages. In this review, we establish general predictions for
   the effects of metamorphosis on personality in insects with complete or
   incomplete metamorphosis and suffering from a strong or weak niche shift
   after metamorphosis. We then reviewed the still rare empirical
   literature and discuss future research axes.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals frequently show long-term consistency in behaviour over
   their lifetimes, referred to as personality. Various models, revolving
   around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals,
   attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types
   within a population, and evaluating them is the key for understanding
   the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from
   divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking
   individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of
   wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and
   related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual
   reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make
   divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking
   behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as
   condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness
   to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets
   (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire
   adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome
   influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to
   willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear
   to protect their assets however, as estimates of residual reproductive
   value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable
   variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was
   affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the
   models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with
   some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal
   consistency that are more difficult to explain.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is defined as consistency in individual differences in
   organismal behavior across time or context, a phenomenon of interest
   within behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Empirical data have revealed
   an ever-increasing number and diversity of taxa that display these
   phenotypic patterns in both wild and captive settings. Moreover, these
   behavioral traits are frequently linked to wild behavior, life history
   strategies, and measures of individual fitness. Understanding
   personality is of particular importance for some animals, such as large
   carnivores, which may express maladaptive behavior that can lead to
   conflict with humans. To date, few studies of personality exist on large
   carnivores and none have investigated the presence of personality in
   black bears (Ursus americanus). Through focal animal sampling, and open
   field, novel object, and startle object tests, we investigate the
   potential for personality in captive black bear cubs. Results indicate
   the presence of personality, with consistency in behavior across five
   metrics for the bold-shy axis, and eight sampling events measuring
   responses for the activity axis. Information presented here reveals the
   presence of personality in black bear cubs, and may provide a framework
   for future investigations into relationships of personality with ecology

Title = {{How intraspecific variation in seed-dispersing animals matters for
   plants}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{897-913}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Seed dispersal by animals is a complex phenomenon, characterized by
   multiple mechanisms and variable outcomes. Most researchers approach
   this complexity by analysing context-dependency in seed dispersal and
   investigating extrinsic factors that might influence interactions
   between plants and seed dispersers. Intrinsic traits of seed dispersers
   provide an alternative way of making sense of the enormous variation in
   seed fates. I review causes of intraspecific variability in frugivorous
   and granivorous animals, discuss their effects on seed dispersal, and
   outline likely consequences for plant populations and communities.
   Sources of individual variation in seed-dispersing animals include
   sexual dimorphism, changes associated with growth and ageing, individual
   specialization, and animal personalities. Sexual dimorphism of
   seed-dispersing animals influences seed fate through diverse mechanisms
   that range from effects caused by sex-specific differences in body size,
   to influences of male versus female cognitive functions. These
   differences affect the type of seed treatment (e.g. dispersal versus
   predation), the number of dispersed seeds, distance of seed dispersal,
   and likelihood that seeds are left in favourable sites for seeds or
   seedlings. The best-documented consequences of individual differences
   associated with growth and ageing involve quantity of dispersed seeds
   and the quality of seed treatment in the mouth and gut. Individual
   specialization on different resources affects the number of dispersed
   plant species, and therefore the connectivity and architecture of
   seed-dispersal networks. Animal personalities might play an important
   role in shaping interactions between plants and dispersers of their
   seeds, yet their potential in this regard remains overlooked. In
   general, intraspecific variation in seed-dispersing animals often
   influences plants through effects of these individual differences on the
   movement ecology of the dispersers. Two conditions are necessary for
   individual variation to exert a strong influence on seed dispersal.
   First, the individual differences in traits should translate into
   differences in crucial characteristics of seed dispersal. Second,
   individual variation is more likely to be important when the proportions
   of particular types of individuals fluctuate strongly in a population or
   vary across space; when proportions are static, it is less likely that
   intraspecific differences will be responsible for changes in the
   dynamics and outcomes of plant-animal interactions. In conclusion,
   focusing on variation among foraging animals rather than on species
   averages might bring new, mechanistic insights to the phenomenon of seed
   dispersal. While this shift in perspective is unlikely to replace the
   traditional approach (based on the assumption that all important
   variation occurs among species), it provides a complementary alternative
   to decipher the enormous variation observed in animal-mediated seed
   dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral avoidance of disease-causing parasites provides a first line

   suspension-feeding oysters Crassostrea virginica respond to the presence

   shell closure and decreasing the clearance of suspended particles from
   the surrounding seawater. The extent of feeding behavior modification
   varied among selectively bred oyster families, indicating genetic
   variation in this trait. Oyster families susceptible to P. marinus
   infection were less likely to modify their feeding behavior when this
   parasite was present, if at all. Characterizing the role of
   anti-parasite behavior in minimizing P. marinus proliferation in oysters
   and the implications of variability among individuals will refine our
   understanding of mechanisms of disease resistance in suspension-feeding

   theory while others were against theoretical predictions, e.g.

Title = {{Personality variation in two predator species does not impact prey

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests that consistent individual differences in
   behavior, better known as animal personality, can shape aspects of
   population and community ecology. Yet, the potential for animal
   personality to affect more complex and non-linear food webs, like those
   seen in nature, remains understudied. Here, we explore the degree to
   which the aggregate behaviors of two predator species simultaneously
   interact to alter prey survival rates and the presence and magnitude of
   trophic cascades. We set up mesocosms in an old-field habitat containing
   four different insect prey species and either two Phidippus clarus
   (Salticidae), two Platycryptus undatus (Salticidae), or one of each
   predator. Prior to initiating each mesocosm, we assayed the activity
   level and boldness of each individual predator and included these
   metrics in our models predicting prey survival and plant damage. We then
   compared the number of surviving prey and plant damage under each of
   these conditions and tested for associations between each of these
   response variables and predator behavior. We found no significant effect
   of predator community composition or predators' behavior on prey
   survival or plant damage. These results suggest that the effects of
   predator personality on prey survival may be subtle or absent in complex
   species interaction modules.
   Significance statement
   Although much research suggests that animal personality can influence
   broader scale ecological phenomena, the ability of animal personality to
   alter complex species interaction modules remains unresolved. We tested
   whether pairs of predators of different personality types differentially
   impacted prey survival rates and plant damage in a tritrophic system,
   and whether these effects varied based on predator community
   composition. We recovered no evidence that predator personality types
   influenced prey survival or plant damage regardless of the predator
   composition considered. These results suggest that the effects of
   personality may be absent or undetectable in more complex, realistic
   ecological settings. The majority of laboratory-based personality
   studies published to date evaluate only dyadic species interactions in
   simplified environments. Our findings therefore raise concerns that such
   studies are prone to overestimate the effects of animal personality.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{312-320}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of male fowl did not depend on social rank after 3
   weeks in stable groups, but were consistent over time for an individual.
   Theory suggests that stable social states, for example, stable social
   hierarchies, may lead to consistent variation in behavior, that is,
   variation in personality. Our results suggest that variation in
   personality is not a consequence of variation in social status and that
   personality is more important than current social position in
   determining individual behavior in stable groups.Individuals often
   differ in behavior in a consistent way, that is, they show variation in
   personality. Understanding the processes explaining the emergence and
   maintenance of this variation is a current major topic in the field of
   animal behavioral research. Recent theoretical models predict that
   differences in various ``states{''} can generate individual variation in
   behavior. Previous studies have mainly focused on endogenous states like
   metabolic rate or energy reserves, but theory also suggests that states
   based on social interactions could play important roles in shaping
   personality. We have earlier demonstrated short-term status-dependent
   variation in behavior in the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus),
   but whether such behavioral variation remains also after a longer period
   of time, is unknown. Therefore, we examine the influence of social
   status on variation in behavior, using experimental manipulation of
   social status in pairs of male domestic fowl. We scored males in 3
   personality assays (novel arena test, novel object test, and aggression
   test) before and after 3 weeks in pairs as either dominant or
   subordinate. We observed individual consistency of behavior despite
   alteration of social status. We further found no support for social
   status acting as a state that generates variation in personality over
   the used time interval: social status had no significant effect on the
   change in behavioral responses between repeated personality tests. Our
   results suggest that personality is more important than current social
   situation for describing individual behavior in stable groups.}},

   lizards}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In many animal populations, individuals exhibit repeatable behavioral
   traits across a range of contexts, and similarly, individuals differ in
   ecological traits such as habitat use, home range sizes, growth rates,
   and mating success. However, links between an individual's positions on
   behavioral vs. ecological axes of variation remain relatively unstudied
   in the wild. In the course of fieldwork on a remote floodplain in
   tropical Australia, we quantified boldness and ecological traits in 86
   free-ranging (radio-tracked) monitor lizards (Varanus panoptes). These
   large (up to 7 kg) lizards exhibited a spectrum of boldness, as
   reflected in correlated scores of responses to approach, handling, and
   novel prey. Bolder lizards had larger core home ranges and higher mating
   success and spent more time in areas of high predator abundance, and
   their seasonal regimes of predation-induced mortality differed from
   those of shyer lizards. Thus, behavioral differences among lizards
   underpin much of the variation in ecological traits and individual
   fitness within this population. Analyses of ecology and microevolution
   in natural populations cannot afford to ignore the complex covariation
   between behavior, ecology, and evolution in the wild.}},

Title = {{Repeatable aversion across threat types is linked with life-history
   traits but is dependent on how aversion is measured}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Personality research suggests that individual differences in risk
   aversion may be explained by links with life-history variation. However,
   few empirical studies examine whether repeatable differences in risk
   avoidance behaviour covary with life-history traits among individuals in
   natural populations, or how these links vary depending on the context
   and the way risk aversion is measured. We measured two different risk
   avoidance behaviours (latency to enter the nest and inspection time) in
   wild great tits (Parus major) in two different contexts-response to a
   novel object and to a predator cue placed at the nest-box during
   incubation-and related these behaviours to female reproductive success
   and condition. Females responded equally strongly to both stimuli, and
   although both behaviours were repeatable, they did not correlate.
   Latency to enter was negatively related to body condition and the number
   of offspring fledged. By contrast, inspection time was directly
   explained by whether incubating females had been flushed from the nest
   before the trial began. Thus, our inferences on the relationship between
   risk aversion and fitness depend on how risk aversion was measured. Our
   results highlight the limitations of drawing conclusions about the
   relevance of single measures of a personality trait such as risk
   aversion.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Consistent differences in behavior between individuals, otherwise known
   as animal personalities, have become a staple in behavioral ecology due
   to their ability to explain a wide range of phenomena. Social organisms
   are especially serviceable to animal personality techniques because they
   can be used to explore behavioral variation at both the individual and
   group level. Despite the success of personality research in social
   organisms generally, and social Hymenoptera in particular, social wasps
   (Vespidae) have received little to no attention in the personality
   literature. In the present study, we test Polistes metricus (Vespidae;
   Polistinae) paper wasp queens for the presence of repeatable variation
   in, and correlations ({''}behavioral syndromes{''}) between, several
   commonly used personality metrics: boldness, aggressiveness,
   exploration, and activity. Our results indicate that P. metricus queens
   exhibit personalities for all measured traits and correlations between
   different behavioral measures. Given that paper wasps have served as a
   model organism for a wide range of phenomena such as kin selection,
   dominance hierarchies, mate choice, facial recognition, social
   parasitism, and chemical recognition, we hope that our results will
   motivate researchers to explore whether, or to what degree, queen
   personality is important in their research programs.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the variation in dispersal, exploration, and aggression
   across time in juvenile progeny produced from wild caught rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at a critical developmental shift associated with
   the highest mortality in fish. By testing multiple ecologically relevant
   behaviours repeatedly in the same individuals, we simultaneously tested
   multiple hypotheses regarding personality, plasticity, and behavioural
   syndromes to better understand the innate behavioural variation in a
   population containing both migratory and resident life histories. There
   were consistent behavioural differences, or personality, between
   individuals across time, for dispersal, aggression, and exploration,
   unrelated to size or sex. The significant repeatabilities (0.10-0.46)
   indicate that these traits are potentially heritable. Also, we found
   both habituation in all behaviours and significant differences between
   individuals in the rate of that habituation, despite no evidence of a
   behavioural syndrome. The identification of this individual level
   variation is a step towards understanding which heritable traits
   selection could influence.}},

Abstract = {{Despite substantial research interest in understanding individual-level
   consistency in behavioral attributes, significant knowledge gaps remain
   across traits and taxa. For example, relatively few studies have looked
   at social personality in large marine species such as elasmobranchs and
   whether or not individual differences in behavior are maintained in
   unstable social groups (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics). However, it is
   important to investigate this topic in other model species than the
   usually small species with short generation times typically investigated
   in these areas of behavioral ecology. Indeed, studies on ecologically
   diverse taxa could provide mechanistic insights into the emergence and
   maintenance of animal personality and dynamics of social groups in
   animals. In addition, understanding social behavior at the group-and
   individual-level could improve conservation management of these large
   animals with long generation times (e.g., removal of particular
   behavioral types by fisheries practices). Here, we investigated
   consistent individual differences in sociability in wild juvenile lemon
   sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) over both short- (4 to 18 days) and
   long-term (4 months) sampling periods. Individual sharks were observed
   in social groups and scored according to the number of social
   interactions performed during observations. Despite variable individual
   group compositions between repeated trials, sharks showed consistent
   individual differences in their social behavior over both time scales.
   These results suggest reduced plasticity and highlight individuality as
   an important explanatory variable for the social dynamics of juvenile
   lemon sharks. In addition, long-term stability observed in this wild
   population demonstrates the importance of personality in the daily
   behavioral repertoire of juvenile lemon sharks. Our results are
   discussed in the context of other shark studies and taxonomic groups and
   potential avenues for future research are proposed.
   Significance statement
   This study investigated the social personality axis in a wild population
   of juvenile lemon sharks. First, we demonstrated consistent individual
   differences in their tendency to socialize. Second, we showed that
   individuals maintained their differences over a four-month period in the
   wild. Finally, we found that individual social behaviors were maintained
   despite being tested in variable group compositions. These results
   highlight the importance of individuality in the social dynamic of a
   poorly investigated animal and suggest personality as an important
   aspect of juvenile lemon sharks' everyday life over a relatively
   long-term period.}},

   between motor functions and individuals}},
Journal = {{LATERALITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{576-598}},
Abstract = {{Motor lateralization is hypothesized to depend on the complexity of the
   motor function, but it might at the same time reflect hemispheric
   dominance within an individual across motor functions. We investigated
   possible motor lateralization patterns in four motor functions of
   different complexity (snout use in a manipulative task, foot use in
   two-stepping tasks and tail curling) in the domestic pig, a tetrapod
   species relevant as farm animal but also as a model in human
   neuroscience. A significant majority of our sample showed individual
   biases for manipulation with their snout and for curling their tail.
   Interestingly, the tail curling was lateralized towards the right at the
   population level and showed stronger lateralization patterns than the
   snout. Using a cluster analysis with combined tail and snout laterality,
   we identified groups of individuals with different lateralization
   patterns across motor functions that potentially reflect the
   individuals' hemispheric dominance. To conclude, our results suggest
   that pigs show lateralization patterns that depend on the motor function
   and on the individual. Such individual lateralization patterns might
   have broader implications for animal personality and welfare. Our study
   lays the methodological groundwork for future research on laterality in
   pigs.}},

Title = {{Habitat complexity dampens selection on prey activity level}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Conspecific prey individuals often exhibit persistent differences in
   behavior (i.e., animal personality) and consequently vary in their
   susceptibility to predation. How this form of selection varies across
   environmental contexts is essential to predicting ecological and
   evolutionary dynamics, yet remains currently unresolved. Here, we use
   three separate predator-prey systems (sea star-snail, wolf
   spider-cricket, and jumping spider-cricket) to independently examine how
   habitat structural complexity influences the selection that predators
   impose on prey behavioral types. Prior to conducting staged
   predator-prey interaction encounters, we ran prey individuals through
   multiple behavioral assays to determine their average activity level. We
   then allowed individual predators to interact with groups of prey in
   either open or structurally complex habitats and recorded the number and
   individual identity of prey that were eaten. Habitat complexity had no
   effect on overall predation rates in any of the three predator-prey
   systems. Despite this, we detected a pervasive interaction between
   habitat structure and individual prey activity level in determining
   individual prey survival. In open habitats, all predators imposed strong
   selection on prey behavioral types: sea stars preferentially consumed
   sedentary snails, while spiders preferentially consumed active crickets.
   Habitat complexity dampened selection within all three systems,
   equalizing the predation risk that active and sedentary prey faced.
   These findings suggest a general effect of habitat complexity that
   reduces the importance of prey activity level in determining individual
   predation risk. We reason this occurs because activity level (i.e.,
   movement) is paramount in determining risk within open environments,
   whereas in complex habitats, other behavioral traits (e.g., escape
   ability to a refuge) may take precedence.}},

Title = {{Boldness-aggression syndromes can reduce population density: behavior
   and demographic heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are widely recognized as important for ecology and
   evolution, but most predictions about ecological impacts are based on
   conceptual models and are therefore imprecise. Borrowing insights from
   the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the
   population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals
   are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific
   contests, but also in foraging, mating, and antipredator behavior, then
   population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in
   demographic rates. We modeled a population with a
   boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant
   through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes
   aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their
   nonaggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type
   is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly
   by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive
   types into a homogeneous nonaggressive population increases the average
   per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this
   reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the
   reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the
   population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two
   types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the
   population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value
   under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a
   formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics
   and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Environmental and developmental conditions can drive substantial
   variation in offspring behaviour and developmental trajectory. While
   incubation temperature is well known to influence development in
   oviparous animals, little is known of the role of parental temperature
   on offspring phenotype (i.e. thermal parental effects). Following
   exposure of male and gravid female jacky dragons, Amphibolurus
   muricatus, to one of two thermal treatments (short-bask versus
   long-bask) and incubation of their eggs at a constant temperature, we
   examined whether the preovipositional parental treatment influenced
   offspring performance-related behaviours. We detected main and
   interactive effects of parental treatment on offspring behaviours
   including feeding, exploration and antipredator. Sex-specific effects of
   parental treatment included long-bask sons being more likely to feed and
   being bolder following predatory attack than short-bask sons, while the
   differences between treatments for daughters were smaller. Behaviours
   were not consistent between 1 week and 1 month of age and showed little
   correlation across behavioural contexts. Some behaviours emerged as
   promising mechanisms of documented parental effects on offspring growth
   and survival in these individuals. In particular, boldness among
   long-bask sons in an antipredator context may be linked to their greater
   rates of growth posthatching. Overall, our findings suggest that thermal
   parental effects influence variation in animal behaviours relevant for
   subsequent fitness outcomes. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Social network models provide a powerful tool to estimate infection risk
   for individual hosts and track parasite transmission through host
   populations. Here, bringing together concepts from social network
   theory, animal personality, and parasite manipulation of host behaviour,
   I argue that not only are social networks shaping parasite transmission,
   but parasites in turn shape social networks through their effects on the
   behaviour of infected individuals. Firstly, I review five general
   categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity
   levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied
   to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all
   of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering
   parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts
   within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g.,
   connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches
   allowing comparisons of social networks pre-versus post-infection are a
   promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks
   and parasite infections.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the extent of repeatable differences in the behavior of
   animals and the factors that influence behavioral expression is
   important for understanding individual fitness and population processes,
   thereby aiding in species conservation. However, little is known about
   the causes of variation in the repeatability of behavioral differences
   among species because rarely have comparative studies been undertaken to
   examine the repeatability of behavioral differences among individuals
   within their natural ecological settings. Using two species of endemic
   subtropical anemonefishes, Amphiprion mccullochi and A. latezonatus at
   Lord Howe and North Solitary Islands, Australia, we conducted an in situ
   comparative analysis of personality traits, examining the repeatability
   of boldness, sociability and aggression as well as the potential role of
   environmental and social factors on behavioral expression. For A.
   mccullochi, only boldness and aggression were highly repeatable and
   these behaviors formed a behavioral syndrome. For A. latezonatus, none
   of the three behaviors were repeatable due to low-inter-individual
   variation in behavior. We suggest that the harsher and more variable
   environmental and social conditions experienced by A. latezonatus have
   resulted in reduced repeatability in behavior, in contrast to A.
   mccullochi which typically inhabits a more stable lagoonal reef
   environment. Additionally, group size and size rank, rather than
   nearest-neighbor distance and anemone size, influenced the expression of
   these behaviors in both species, suggesting that behavioral variation
   was more sensitive to social than environmental factors. Overall,
   differences in repeatability between these closely related species

Abstract = {{Anemones exhibit distinct between-individual differences in behaviours
   such as risk-taking and aggressiveness. The genus of anemone Actinia
   contains numerous morphotypes which occupy different locations on the
   shore and show different levels of aggressiveness. In this study we
   explored whether their propensity to take risks likewise differed
   between three groups of anemones: Actinia prasina; a low shore morph of
   Actinia equina characterised by a blue limbus around the pedal disc
   (described as ring-present, RP); and upper shore morphs of A. equina
   characterised by a lack of such a ring (ring-absent, RA). Risk-taking
   behaviour was measured using startle-response durations across two
   trials, separated by two weeks. In-between trials anemones were allowed
   to engage in pairwise contests with a randomly-selected opponent, during
   which the number of occurrences of behaviours related to movement of the
   body, tentacles and acrorhagi were counted and compared between groups
   to identify systematic variation in potentially offensive and defensive
   postures. Length of holotrich nematocysts, thought to be linked to
   aggressiveness, was also measured. Both risk-taking and
   inflation/deflation of acrorhagi significantly differed between groups:
   RA anemones were risk-prone and aggressive, RP anemones risk-averse and
   non-aggressive, A. prasina occupying a position in-between. Likewise
   nematocyst lengths varied between groups, shortest among RP anemones and
   longest in RA anemones. These data suggest that different morphotypes
   are associated with differences in risk-taking which may result from a
   complex interplay of various ecological factors linked to the habitats
   these morphotypes occupy, and add further credence to theories on
   speciation within the Actinia equina species complex.}},

Title = {{Performance of wild brown trout in relation to energetic state and
   lab-scored activity during the early-life survival bottleneck}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which
   individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size,
   energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in
   the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout.
   In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown
   trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the
   laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but
   not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the
   fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1
   month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully
   compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued
   growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural
   environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual
   baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food
   restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by
   growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive
   association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by
   recapture probability), but no significant differences between
   food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively
   influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in
   the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption
   that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments.
   For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with
   high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to
   high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and
   reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk.
   Significance statement
   In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better
   survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the
   balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due
   to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals
   can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely
   limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as
   growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab,
   but not realized in natural streams.}},

Title = {{Partial diel migration: A facultative migration underpinned by long-term
   inter-individual variation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1246-1256}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. The variations in migration that comprise partial diel migrations,
   putatively occur entirely as a consequence of behavioural flexibility.
   However, seasonal partial migrations are increasingly recognised to be
   mediated by a combination of reversible plasticity in response to
   environmental variation and individual variation due to genetic and
   environmental effects.
   2. Here, we test the hypothesis that while partial diel migration
   heterogeneity occurs primarily due to short-term within-individual
   flexibility in behaviour, long-term individual differences in migratory
   behaviour also underpin this migration variation.
   3. Specifically, we use a hierarchical behavioural reaction norm
   approach to partition within- and among-individual variation in depth
   use and diel plasticity in depth use, across short- and long-term
   time-scales, in a group of 47 burbot (Lota lota) tagged with
   depth-sensing acoustic telemetry transmitters.
   4. We found that within- individual variation at the
   among-dates-within-seasons and among-seasons scale, explained the
   dominant proportion of phenotypic variation. However, individuals also
   repeatedly differed in their expression of migration behaviour over the
   2 year study duration.
   5. These results reveal that diel migration variation occurs primarily
   due to short- term within-individual flexibility in depth use and diel
   migration behaviour. However, repeatable individual differences also
   played a key role in mediating partial diel migration.
   6. These findings represent a significant advancement of our
   understanding of the mechanisms generating the important, yet poorly
   understood phenomena of partial diel migration. Moreover, given the
   pervasive occurrence of diel migrations across aquatic taxa, these
   findings indicate that individual differences have an important, yet
   previously unacknowledged role in structuring the temporal and vertical
   dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Aggressiveness as a latent personality trait of domestic dogs: Testing
   local independence and measurement invariance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or
   ``latent{''} personality traits that explain broad patterns of
   behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g.,
   factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but
   infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal
   personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e.,
   uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect
   (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with
   behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of
   individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using
   observations of aggression in four age classes (4-10 months, 10 months-3
   years, 3-6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N =
   4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported
   the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits
   underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and
   aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; TuckerLewis
   index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression
   across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).
   However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but
   not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by
   latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards
   people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus,
   sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple
   functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the
   robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically
   assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors
   influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because
   inaccurate ``aggressive personality{''} trait attributions can be costly
   to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{97-105}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is an ongoing debate on how personality types are maintained
   within populations. We tested, for the first time, the potential of
   trait multidimensionality and trait compensation, where prey compensate
   for the costs of one trait by relying more on another one, in
   maintaining variation in boldness within a population. We studied how
   four boldness-related traits and swimming escape performance covary and
   shape the probability of survival and autotomy of Ischnura pumilio
   damselfly larvae in an experiment with predatory dragonfly larvae. Our
   results did not support the common belief that bold individuals are
   selected against in terms of survival selection by predation. Instead,
   we found survival selection favouring individuals combining being bold
   for two boldness-related traits. The four boldness-related traits did
   not covary frequently, supporting the multidimensionality of boldness.
   Moreover, animals bolder for one trait (activity in the presence of
   predator cues) were shyer for another trait (response to predator cues),
   which indicated trait compensation. However, the support for trait
   compensation was limited. The only other case of trait compensation was
   that bold larvae compensated for their increased risk-taking behaviour
   in the presence of a predator with a higher probability of autotomy.
   These patterns may contribute to maintaining variation in boldness in
   damselfly populations. Just as boldness-related traits are
   multidimensional, the mechanisms underlying their persistence in natural
   populations are also likely to be multifaceted. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{The connection between reproductive fitness and animal personality is
   not fully understood. Using computer simulations and machine learning,
   we found high accuracy rules that predict which personalities are
   associated with fitness for two correlated measures of components of
   fitness applied a posteriori for classificatory purposes: fitness
   component (1) in terms of survival and short-term reproductive success,
   and fitness component (2) in terms of long term reproductive success
   which is indirectly related to survival of the parents. Animals are
   represented in the abstract as individuals with a genome that through
   time develops into certain characteristic behaviors and personalities.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulation study of its
   kind that extracts rules to investigate the link between personality and
   fitness. Clearly separated behaviors between fit and non-fit individuals
   emerged through the evolution of the population over time without
   top-down processing. Moreover, we did not employ a pre-defined fitness
   function, in order to minimize any possible biases toward a specific
   type of behavior. With respect to fitness component (1), we found that
   individuals with one of two extreme values of a personality trait
   (either bold or fearful) tend to be most fit, which agrees with
   empirical studies. With respect to fitness component (2), we found that
   when resources are low, fit individuals search for food whereas if food
   is abundant, they focus on reproduction, thereby suggesting the context
   dependence of fitness related behaviors. Once again, these results agree
   with empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Although much work has analysed how individual behavioural plasticity
   and adaptations to ecological conditions (e.g. density, sex-ratio,
   resource distribution) shape mating systems, few studies have assessed
   the relative importance of multiple factors in explaining why mating
   systems vary from one sub-population to the next even in the same
   ecological conditions. Differences among groups in their phenotypic
   composition, such as their average phenotype, within-group variation in
   phenotype, or the phenotype of individuals occupying key social roles
   might shape the mating system emerging at the group level and explain
   some portion of mating system variability. Here, we take advantage of
   the mating system flexibility of stream water striders (Aquarius
   remigis) to investigate how phenotypic composition affects the mating
   system emerging at the group level. Groups exhibited stable mating
   systems varying from scramble polygyny with intense sexual conflict, to
   systems with a clear dominant male guarding a ``harem{''} of females. We
   found that male size asymmetries and the personality of the largest
   individuals within groups had important effects on the group's mating
   system. The group's average male and female personality, size, and
   social plasticity also explained some of the variation in mating
   systems. Our study is one of the first to quantify significant
   relationships between group phenotypic composition and mating system
   variability.}},

   siblings}},
Journal = {{COGENT PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Notwithstanding their relatedness, siblings vary as much as strangers
   with respect to personality traits. Attempting to explain this paradox
   across many publications, Frank J. Sulloway invokes evolutionary theory,
   specifically emphasizing Malthusian competition and referencing the
   concept of adaptive radiation, which produced beak variation among
   Darwinian finches as they spread across the Galapagos Archipelago.
   However, Sulloway understands birth order and other familial dynamics to
   create personality variation among siblings, using evolutionary concepts
   only as illustrative comparisons. The present paper argues that Sulloway
   mistook a literal truth for an analogy. Sibling personality variation
   does not mirror a process of evolution, it is a process of evolution.
   Substituting the macroevolutionary process of adaptive radiation for the
   microevolutionary process of adaptive diversification, and emphasizing
   the perpetuation of genetic material above the survival of the organism,
   sibling personality variation is herein explained as a hedge against
   lineage extinction. Unable either to predict environmental challenges or
   create pluripotent offspring, parents diversify their brood and thereby
   diversify their risk. As discussed, sibling personality variation as an
   ontogenetic process of adaptation remains relevant, but only in so far
   as it augments a primary genetic process of evolution.}},

Title = {{Boldness: are open field and startle tests measuring the same
   personality trait?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{143-151}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Boldness, the willingness of individuals to engage in risky behaviour,
   is one of the most studied personality traits. It has been measured
   using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different
   assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted
   to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced
   mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under
   standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation.
   Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African
   striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open
   field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from
   startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of
   risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle
   tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During
   open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the
   wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature).
   During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a
   protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions)
   after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking
   behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were
   repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across
   contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of
   risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures,
   supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different
   personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two
   assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in
   the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle
   test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Development of the ``Highly Sensitive Dog{''} questionnaire to evaluate
   the personality dimension ``Sensory Processing Sensitivity{''} in dogs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{In humans, the personality dimension `sensory processing sensitivity
   (SPS)', also referred to as ``high sensitivity{''}, involves deeper
   processing of sensory information, which can be associated with
   physiological and behavioral overarousal. However, it has not been
   studied up to now whether this dimension also exists in other species.
   SPS can influence how people perceive the environment and how this
   affects them, thus a similar dimension in animals would be highly
   relevant with respect to animal welfare. We therefore explored whether
   SPS translates to dogs, one of the primary model species in personality
   research. A 32-item questionnaire to assess the ``highly sensitive dog
   score{''} (HSD-s) was developed based on the ``highly sensitive
   person{''} (HSP) questionnaire. A large-scale, international online
   survey was conducted, including the HSD questionnaire, as well as
   questions on fearfulness, neuroticism, ``demographic{''} (e.g. dog sex,
   age, weight; age at adoption, etc.) and ``human{''} factors (e.g. owner
   age, sex, profession, communication style, etc.), and the HSP
   questionnaire. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effect models with
   forward stepwise selection to test prediction of HSD-s by the
   above-mentioned factors, with country of residence and dog breed treated
   as random effects. A total of 3647 questionnaires were fully completed.
   HSD-, fearfulness, neuroticism and HSP-scores showed good internal
   consistencies, and HSD-s only moderately correlated with fearfulness and
   neuroticism scores, paralleling previous findings in humans. Intra- (N =
   447) and inter-rater (N = 120) reliabilities were good. Demographic and
   human factors, including HSP score, explained only a small amount of the
   variance of HSD-s. A PCA analysis identified three subtraits of SPS,
   comparable to human findings. Overall, the measured personality
   dimension in dogs showed good internal consistency, partial independence
   from fearfulness and neuroticism, and good intra-and inter-rater
   reliability, indicating good construct validity of the HSD
   questionnaire. Human and demographic factors only marginally affected
   the HSD-s suggesting that, as hypothesized for human SPS, a genetic
   basis may underlie this dimension within the dog species.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animal personalities interact with environmental conditions
   to generate differences in behavior, a phenomenon of growing interest
   for understanding the effects of environmental enrichment on captive
   animals. Wheels are common environmental enrichment for laboratory
   rodents, but studies conflict on how this influences behavior, and
   interaction of wheels with individual personalities has rarely been
   examined. We examined whether wheel access altered personality profiles
   in adult Siberian dwarf hamsters. We assayed animals in a tunnel maze
   twice for baseline personality, then again at two and at seven weeks
   after the experimental group was provisioned with wheels in their home
   cages. Linear mixed model selection was used to assess changes in
   behavior over time and across environmental gradient of wheel exposure.
   While animals showed consistent inter-individual differences in
   activity, activity personality did not change upon exposure to a wheel.
   Boldness also varies among individuals, and there is evidence for female
   boldness scores converging after wheel exposure, that is, opposite
   shifts in behavior by high and low boldness individuals, although sample
   size is too small for the mixed model results to be robust. In general,
   Siberian dwarf hamsters appear to show low behavioral plasticity,
   particularly in general activity, in response to running wheels. (C)

Abstract = {{Animals in a population consistently differ from one another in
   behavioural types over time and this difference can affect intra- and
   interspecific relationships. However, empirical studies about roles of
   behavioural individual variation in interspecific interactions are
   scarce. Here, we provide evidence that inter-individual variation of a
   cichlid in aggression affects access to its territory by a
   heterospecific cichlid. In Lake Tanganyika, a zoobenthivorous cichlid
   Neolamprologus mustax (Nm) is admitted into territories of an algivorous
   Variabilichromis moorii (Vm) to prey on benthic invertebrates, while
   other zoobenthivorous fishes are chased from the territories. We
   conducted an experiment in which caged Nm fish were exposed twice to
   each Vm fish in natural habitats. Results indicated repeatable
   individual variations in Vm aggression towards Nm. Moreover, diving
   observations indicated that Nm fish frequently used some of Vm
   territories inside their own territories, but rarely or never used
   others. This uneven use of Vm territories by the Nm fish was negatively
   correlated with individual variations in Vm aggression. We conclude that
   the preferential access of Nm to Vm territory is gained by Nm's
   recognising more tolerant Vm fish or discriminating among sites for
   their territories.}},

Abstract = {{Study of the development of individuality is often hampered by rapidly
   changing behavioral repertoires and the need for minimally intrusive
   tests. We individually tested 33 kittens from eight litters of the
   domestic cat in an arena for 3min once a week for the first 3 postnatal
   weeks, recording the number of separation calls and the duration of
   locomotor activity. Kittens showed consistent and stable individual
   differences on both measures across and within trials. Stable individual
   differences in the emission of separation calls across trials emerged
   already within the first 10s of testing, and in locomotor activity
   within the first 30s. Furthermore, individual kittens' emission of
   separation calls, but not their locomotor activity, was highly stable
   within trials. We conclude that separation calls provide an efficient,
   minimally intrusive and reliable measure of individual differences in
   behavior during development in the cat, and possibly in other species
   emitting such calls.}},

   Implications for conservation practices}},

Pages = {{98-106}},

Abstract = {{Captive breeding programmes offer a method for preventing the extinction
   of threatened species, but often have difficulty establishing
   self-sustaining populations and generating individuals for release. This
   difficulty can arise because the behaviour of captive-reared animals
   differs from wild animals. Whilst the effect of captivity on animal
   behaviour has been widely reported, few studies have explicitly compared
   differences between captive-reared and wild-caught animals. Even fewer
   have examined behavioural types (a composition of behavioural traits)
   displayed in novel environments, which is particularly relevant for
   determining reintroduction success. Further, the transgenerational
   effects on behavioural type, and potential differences between sexes in
   response to captivity, remain almost completely unknown. Using house
   mouse (Mus musculus) as a model for small mammals, we tested whether
   behavioural types displayed in a novel environment differed between
   captive-reared and wild-caught animals. In addition, it was tested
   whether behavioural types were subject to transgenerational effects in
   captivity, and whether there were sex-specific differences in
   behavioural types. We used an open field test to simulate a novel
   environment. Captive-reared mice were found to differ in their boldness
   and activity behavioural type compared to their wild-caught mice (p <
   0.001). There was marginal evidence for transgenerational effects on
   behavioural type in captivity, but three behavioural traits displayed a
   shift away from wild behaviours (\% Time active: p < 0.001; \% Time
   mobile: p = 0.004; Centre: maximum speed: p = 0.004). Furthermore,
   behavioural types of individuals in captivity did not differ depending
   on sex (F-0: p = 0.161; F-1: p = 0.665), however behavioural type did
   differ between wild-caught females and males (p = 0.015). These findings
   suggest that captivity can result in behavioural changes and loss of
   sex-specific behaviours. In addition, phenotypic plasticity may have a
   significant influence on behavioural type. This knowledge may be
   critical for developing methods to improve small mammal reintroduction
   programmes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{`Animal personalities' have been shown to exist in many species. Yet,
   fluctuations in the stability of these inter-individual behavioural
   differences are not well understood. Against this background, we
   wondered whether behavioural consistency over time is affected by the
   reproductive cycle. Female mice were tested twice at an interval of
   eight weeks in four paradigms assessing social interest as well as
   anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion. Twenty-two
   individuals were tested repeatedly near ovulation, whereas another
   twenty-two were tested repeatedly in the non-receptive phase. While we
   found no major behavioural effects at the group level, the reproductive
   state indeed had profound effects on behavioural stability over time:
   social interest as well as anxiety-like behaviour proved to be
   significantly less predictable near ovulation. It is generally believed
   that phenotypic plasticity is limited due to the costs it brings about.
   In this context, our data indicate that females accept higher costs in
   phases directly related to fitness maximization.}},

Abstract = {{Neophobia is an important personality trait that allows animals to
   minimize exposure to threat. We investigated the existence of consistent
   individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective
   was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with
   behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful
   situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of
   neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a
   feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the
   presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in
   the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental
   treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among
   individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation
   (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding
   bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher
   concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic
   stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic
   (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the
   presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural
   response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the
   existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and
   physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable
   indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue
   for the study of animal personality in the wild. (C) 2017 The

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{The early social environment can profoundly affect behavioral and
   physiological phenotypes. We investigated how male wild cavy offspring,
   whose mothers had either lived in a stable (SE) or an unstable social
   environment (UE) during pregnancy and lactation, differed in their
   anxiety-like behavior and stress responsiveness. At two different time
   points in life, we tested the offspring's anxiety-like behavior in a
   dark-light test and their endocrine reaction to challenge in a cortisol
   reactivity test. Furthermore, we analyzed whether individual traits
   remained stable over time. There was no effect of the early social
   environment on anxiety-like behavior and stress responsiveness. However,
   at an individual level, anxiety-like behavior was stable over time in
   UE-but not in SE-sons. Stress responsiveness, in turn, was rather
   inconsistent in UE-sons and temporally stable in SE-sons. Conclusively,
   we showed for the first time that the early social environment
   differentially shapes the stability of behavioral and endocrine traits.
   At first glance, these results may be surprising, but they can be
   explained by the different functions anxiety-like behavior and stress
   responsiveness have. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distance at which animals start to flee from approaching threats
   should reflects the degree of fearfulness, and thus, provides a useful
   measurement to evaluate animal personality and tolerance to human
   disturbance. Such metrics measurements, however, are mostly limited to
   open, high visible habitats, such as grasslands and urban parks.
   Alternative measurements are required for other types of habitats, such
   as typical forests. For arboreal species, we expect that a vertical
   escape distance (VED), the height at which animals stop climbing in a
   tree toward approaching threats, would reflect animal fearfulness. We
   compared VED and two commonly used metrics, alert distance (AD) and
   flight initiation distance (FID) in the Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus
   vulgaris) towards human approach. We found that VED was significantly
   related with FID, but not AD. Data collection rate in VED was two to
   three times higher than that in the two previous metrics in vegetated
   areas. In natural environments, VED would also reflect the degree of
   fearfulness in arboreal species.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of consistent individual differences in behavior,
   often termed ``personality,{''} for adapting and coping with threats and
   novel environmental conditions has advanced considerably during the last
   decade. However, advancements are almost exclusively associated with
   higher-order animals, whereas studies focusing on smaller aquatic
   organisms are still rare. Here, we show individual differences in the
   swimming behavior of Daphnia magna, a clonal freshwater invertebrate,
   before, during, and after being exposed to a lethal threat, ultraviolet
   radiation (UVR). We show consistency in swimming velocity among both
   mothers and daughters of D. magna in a neutral environment, whereas this
   pattern breaks down when exposed to UVR. Our study also, for the first
   time, illustrates how the ontogenetic development in swimming and
   refuge-seeking behavior of young individuals eventually approaches that
   of adults. Overall, we show that aquatic invertebrates are far from
   being identical robots, but instead they show considerable individual
   differences in behavior that can be attributed to both ontogenetic
   development and individual consistency. Our study also demonstrates, for
   the first time, that behavioral consistency and repeatability, that is,
   something resembling `` personality,{''} is context and state dependent
   in this zooplankter taxa.}},

   formative. Translocation biology offers an important opportunity to
   showcase the compassionate conservation approach because translocations
   encompass direct care and management of individual animals along with
   concerns for population and species health. Historically, a
   one-size-fits-all approach to translocations has proven to be misguided.
   Current advances in the field offer an important opportunity to apply
   the methodological focus that animal welfare science has on individuals
   and social groups for improved conservation outcomes. In particular, the
   evolutionary and behavioural science insights into the personality of
   individual animals highlights that the welfare of individual animals and
   the variation among them are integral to population and species
   recovery. In a review of translocation biology, animal personality and
   with the inclusion of a translocation case study, I show that
   translocation biology offers a clear case for the application of
   Compassionate Conservation principles.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research in behavioural ecology has revealed the structure of
   animal personality and connections to ecologically and evolutionarily
   important traits. Personality is hypothesized to influence social
   interactions through individual behavioural differences or
   personality-based dyadic interactions. We describe the structure of
   personality traits and ask if two traits, boldness and exploration, play
   a role in the strength or pattern of social associations in a wild
   population of degus, a rodent that often lives communally with unrelated
   conspecifics. Boldness was repeatable in both adults and juveniles, but
   exploration was only repeatable in adults. We found evidence for a
   behavioural syndrome between exploration and boldness in adult degus. We
   documented negative assortment by exploratory personality type; more
   exploratory animals shared burrows with less exploratory animals.
   However, tendency towards boldness and exploration were not predictive
   of association strength. Our results highlight a potential connection
   between personality and social structure in a communally nesting
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Individual natal dispersal behaviour is often difficult to predict as it
   can be influenced by multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors.
   Individual differences in personality have been shown to be an important
   correlate of dispersal behaviour. However, the relationships between
   personality traits and dispersal are often inconsistent within and
   across studies and the causes of these discrepancies are often unknown.
   Here we sought to determine how individual differences in activity and
   aggression, as measured in an open-field trial, were related to natal
   dispersal distance in a wild population of North American red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). For 14 cohorts, while individual aggression
   consistently had no association with dispersal distance, the association
   between activity and dispersal fluctuated through time, mediated by
   population density. The environmental-dependence of the relationship
   between personality and dispersal in this population is indicative of
   the importance of considering external conditions when predicting
   dispersal behaviour.}},

Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{909-917}},
Abstract = {{Despite many positive benefits of ecotourism, increased human encounters
   with wildlife may have detrimental effects on wild animals. As
   charismatic megafauna, nesting and foraging sea turtles are increasingly
   the focus of ecotourism activities. The purpose of our study was to
   quantify the behavioral responses of immature green turtles (Chelonia
   mydas) to disturbance by snorkelers, and to investigate whether turtles
   have individual-level responses to snorkeler disturbance. Using a
   standardized disturbance stimulus in the field, we recorded turtle
   behaviors pre- and post-disturbance by snorkelers. Ninety percent of
   turtles disturbed by snorkeler (n = 192) initiated their flights at
   distances of <= 3 m. Using principal component analysis, we identified
   two distinct turtle personality types, `bold' and `timid', based upon
   145 encounters of 19 individually identified turtles and five
   disturbance response variables. There was significant intra-individual
   repeatability in behavioral responses to disturbance, but bolder turtles
   had more behavioral plasticity and less consistent responses than more
   timid individuals. Bolder individuals with reduced evasion responses
   might be at a higher risk of shark predation, while more timid turtles
   might have greater energetic consequences due to non-lethal predator
   effects and repeated snorkeler disturbance. Over the longer term, a
   turtle population with a mix of bold and timid individuals may promote
   more resilient populations. We recommend that snorkelers maintain >3 m
   distance from immature green turtles when snorkeling, and that
   ecotourism activities be temporally and spatially stratified. Further,
   turtle watching guidelines need to be communicated to both tour
   operators and independent snorkelers to reduce the disturbance of
   turtles.}},

   aggressiveness as the number of prey killed per 2-hour period.
   Boldness/shyness was assessed as a latency of initiating exploration in
   a novel environment. We found the presence of the behavioral syndrome in
   P. albidus, as bold individuals were also more aggressive than were shy
   individuals. The syndrome was consistent through time within the

Title = {{Is Maximum Food Intake in Endotherms Constrained by Net or Factorial
   Aerobic Scope? Lessons from the Leaf-Eared Mouse}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Food availability varies substantially throughout animals' lifespans,
   thus the ability to profit from high food levels may directly influence
   animal fitness. Studies exploring the link between basal metabolic rate
   (BMR), growth, reproduction, and other fitness traits have shown varying
   relationships in terms of both magnitude and direction. The diversity of
   results has led to the hypothesis that these relationships are modulated
   by environmental conditions (e.g., food availability), suggesting that
   the fitness consequences of a given BMR may be context-dependent. In
   turn, there is indirect evidence that individuals with an increased
   capacity for aerobic work also have a high capacity for acquiring energy
   from food. Surprisingly, very few studies have explored the correlation
   between maximum rates of energy acquisition and BMR in endotherms, and
   to the best of our knowledge, none have attempted to elucidate
   relationships between the former and aerobic capacity {[}e.g., maximum
   metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope (Factorial aerobic scope, FAS; Net
   aerobic scope, NAS)] In this study, we measured BMR, MMR, maximum food
   intake (recorded under low ambient temperature and ad libitum food
   conditions; MFI), and estimated aerobic scope in the leaf-eared mouse
   (Phyllotis darwini). We, then, examined correlations among these
   variables to determine whether metabolic rates and aerobic scope are
   functionally correlated, and whether an increased aerobic capacity is
   related to a higher MFI. We found that aerobic capacity measured as NAS
   is positively correlated with MFI in endotherms, but with neither FAS
   nor BMR. Therefore, it appears plausible that the capacity for
   assimilating energy under conditions of abundant resources is determined
   adaptively by NAS, as animals with higher NAS would be promoted by
   selection. In theory, FAS is an invariant measurement of the extreme
   capacity for energy turnover in relation to resting expenditure, whereas
   NAS represents the maximum capacity for simultaneous aerobic processes
   above maintenance levels. Accordingly, in our study, FAS and NAS
   represent different biological variables; FAS, in contrast to NAS, may
   not constrain food intake. The explanations for these differences are
   discussed in biological and mathematical terms; further, we encourage
   the use of NAS rather than FAS when analyzing the aerobic capacity of
   animals.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{183-195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although personality has been widely studied among animal species, only
   a few studies have investigated the long-term development of personality
   during early ontogeny. In fact, no study of nonhuman primates has
   consistently mapped personality development from birth to adulthood. Our
   study aimed at closing this gap by examining the development of
   personality among free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, using
   longitudinal behavioural data of 24 subjects (3758 h) collected from
   birth to 7 years of age on the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico,
   U.S.A. In our analyses we combined different frameworks of animal
   personality research to discuss behavioural differences in terms of
   latent personality models, behavioural syndromes and behavioural
   characters. The results showed that a core model of rhesus macaque
   personality, comprising three latent factors (Fearfulness, Aggression,
   Sociability), can already be established over the course of the first 7
   years of life. However, only Fearfulness emerged consistently throughout
   development. While the factor of Sociability diffused during maturation,
   Aggression stabilized towards adulthood after having inconsistent
   loadings during infancy. When assessing correlations among behaviours
   separately on the within- and between-individual level, again only
   Fearfulness showed significant results averaged over the entire study
   period and can therefore be classified as behavioural syndrome or
   behavioural character. We discuss differences in correlations,
   interactions between sex and age and the effect of maternal rank as
   potential source of differences in stability of latent traits.
   Furthermore, we assessed plasticity of behaviour with regard to first
   maternity in females and natal dispersal of males. While the latter was
   accompanied by an increase of fearful behaviour and decrease of physical
   aggression, first maternity was marked by a mixed pattern of changes.
   Overall, our results suggest that rhesus macaques are not born into
   their personality, but grow into it. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Personality has been associated with reproductive success in humans and
   other animals, suggesting potential evolutionary selection pressures.
   However, studies to date have only examined these associations on a
   phenotypic level, which may be inadequate in estimating evolutionary
   change. Using a large longitudinal twin dataset of contemporary Finns,
   we compared the phenotypic (breeder's equation) and genetically informed
   (the Robertson-Price identity) associations between lifetime
   reproductive success (LRS) and two personality traits-neuroticism and
   extraversion. Neuroticism was not associated with LRS at the phenotypic
   nor genetic level, while extraversion was associated with higher LRS in
   men both phenotypically and genetically. Compared to the univariate
   phenotypic analysis, the genetic analysis suggested a larger selection
   response of extraversion, and a selection response of neuroticism due to
   indirect selection. We estimated that neuroticism decreases by .05
   standard deviations and extraversion increases by .11 standard
   deviations by one generation. Our results highlight the importance of
   considering genetic associations between personality and fitness and
   investigating several inter-related personality traits and their
   covariance with each other to predict responses to selection more
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour and physiological responses to
   stress are associated with evolutionary adaptive variation and thus raw
   material for evolution. In farmed animals, the interest in consistent
   trait associations, i.e. coping styles, has increased dramatically over
   the last years. However, one of limitations of the available knowledge,
   regarding the temporal consistency, is that it refers always to
   short-term consistency (usually few weeks). The present study used an
   escape response during a net restraining test, previously shown to be an
   indicative of coping styles in seabream, to investigate long-term
   consistency of coping styles both over time and during different life
   history stages. Results showed both short-term (14 days) consistency and
   long-term (8 months) consistency of escape response. However, we did not
   found consistency in the same behaviour after sexual maturation when the
   restraining test was repeated 16, 22 and 23 months after the first test
   was performed. In conclusion, this study showed consistent behaviour
   traits in seabream when juveniles, and a loss of this behavioural traits
   when adults. Therefore, these results underline that adding a life story
   approach to data interpretation as an essential step forward towards
   coping styles foreground. Furthermore, a fine-tuning of aquaculture
   rearing strategies to adapt to different coping strategies may need to
   be adjusted differently at early stages of development and adults to
   improve the welfare of farmed fish.}},

   domestic dogs}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic integration describes the complex interrelationships between
   organismal traits, traditionally focusing on morphology. Recently,
   research has sought to represent behavioural phenotypes as composed of
   quasi-independent latent traits. Concurrently, psychologists have
   opposed latent variable interpretations of human behaviour, proposing
   instead a network perspective envisaging interrelationships between
   behaviours as emerging from causal dependencies. Network analysis could
   also be applied to understand integrated behavioural phenotypes in
   animals. Here, we assimilate this cross-disciplinary progression of
   ideas by demonstrating the use of network analysis on survey data
   collected on behavioural and motivational characteristics of police
   patrol and detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Networks of
   conditional independence relationships illustrated a number of
   functional connections between descriptors, which varied between dog
   types. The most central descriptors denoted desirable characteristics in
   both patrol and detection dog networks, with `Playful' being widely
   correlated and possessing mediating relationships between descriptors.
   Bootstrap analyses revealed the stability of network results. We discuss
   the results in relation to previous research on dog personality, and
   benefits of using network analysis to study behavioural phenotypes. We
   conclude that a network perspective offers widespread opportunities for
   advancing the understanding of phenotypic integration in animal
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{We examined how different exploratory behavioral types of largemouth
   bass responded to differing prey communities by determining effects on
   growth, survival and diet in experimental ponds. We found evidence that
   non-explorer largemouth bass target young-of-year bluegill early on in
   life, but bluegill were not an important diet item by late summer. The
   presence of young-of-year bluegill as prey does appear to affect the
   foraging strategy of the two exploring types differently. In the absence
   of small bluegill, both behavioral types feed primarily on benthic
   invertebrates and zooplankton. When small bluegill were present, we saw
   a shift away from zooplankton as prey for largemouth bass. However, that
   shift was toward more benthic invertebrates for non-exploring behavioral
   types and toward terrestrial insects for exploring behavioral types.
   Thus, it appears that prey community composition can have important
   effects on the way in which different behavioral types interact with
   their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Biological variability is no longer considered as statistical noise, but
   rather as an adaptive benefit. This variability comes from consistent
   differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals
   to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{''},
   ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how
   to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency
   over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about
   the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because
   contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to
   the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in
   personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely
   to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as
   important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was
   to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability)
   impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis,
   one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared
   juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for
   feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days.
   Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable
   versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass
   reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer
   than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they
   took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/-
   34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was
   similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing
   a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before
   and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance
   of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness.
   In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time
   should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as
   growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially
   heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of
   environmental conditions and life history on behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Observed movement patterns are the response of the interaction between
   environmental variables and the animal internal state. Therefore, even
   individuals of the same species experiencing similar environmental
   conditions can exhibit different behavioural responses, as these
   responses can be highly repeatable within individuals. Here, we
   investigated the nocturnal movement behaviour of a territorial species,
   by radiotracking 26 eagle owls Bubo bubo in order to analyze within and
   between individual variation with respect to movement parameters and
   route choice. Owls showed a considerable individual consistency in all
   movement parameters and made repeated use of similar routes while moving
   within fixed home ranges. Thus, movement parameters varied much less
   between repeated nightly trajectories than between different
   individuals. Furthermore, when we compared different individuals
   inhabiting the same territory in different years, within-group
   repeatability was low or non-significant suggesting that the spatial
   configuration of habitat does not always represents one of the main
   drivers in animal movement behaviour. Similarly, male individuals
   appeared to exhibit greater repeatability than females. The overall
   pattern of repeatability we found seems to identify such consistent
   movement behaviour not only as the expression of individual response to
   external/internal inputs but also as an additional trait to include in
   the broad definition of animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals show consistent differences in behavioural responses
   when coping with environmental challenges. Consistency over time and
   across context in a behavioural trait is an indication for animal
   personality. Chronotypes refer to consistent inter-individual
   differences in diurnal rhythmicity driven by underlying variation in
   circadian clock processes. Personality traits and chronotype may relate
   to a single behavioural syndrome, but few studies have investigated such
   a link explicitly. Here, we explored zebrafish larvae for the presence
   of consistency in activity levels and timing, and their correlation with
   and without external cues (Zeitgeber: light-dark cycle versus constant
   light). We found individual consistency in activity level and timing,
   and their correlation independent of the presence of Zeitgeber:
   early-active individuals were less active overall than late-active
   individuals. Our study suggests a link between personality and
   chronotype and provides new insights into the early development of
   individual variation in behavioural tendencies of zebrafish.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in personality traits is predicted to reflect physiology, but
   the extent to which variations in stress hormones derive from
   differences in personality and/or state-dependent factors remains
   unclear. To investigate this, wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) were
   briefly brought into captivity and scored for personality and
   corticosterone (Cort) concentrations. More active females had lower
   baseline Cort than less active individuals. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia did not co-vary with baseline Cort. Stress-induced Cort
   concentrations were correlated negatively with exploratory tendency and
   haematocrit, but positively with mass gain in captivity. Therefore,
   baseline and stress-induced Cort concentrations in wintering blue tits
   were associated with state-dependent variables, sex, age and personality
   traits. Key to interpreting the physiology of personality traits seems
   to be their interactions with other traits that mediate ability to
   utilise resources, and thus influence an individual's perception of its
   current and future energy balance.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1489-1507}},
Abstract = {{Studies of integrated phenotypes sometimes reveal correlations between
   mating effort, favoured by sexual selection, and risk-taking, favoured
   by survival selection. We used Girardinus metallicus to examine the
   relationship between rank order of mating effort and risk-taking. We
   measured risk-taking in a novel environment containing a predator. We
   then paired males, using aggression to assign dominant or subordinate
   status, and examined mating behaviour. Dominant males showed higher
   mating effort, but did not exhibit any relationship between risk-taking
   and mating effort. Subordinate males exhibited a cross-context
   correlation, as males were either more willing to take risks and
   aggressive or more hesitant to take risks and nonaggressive. Less
   risk-averse, aggressive subordinate males may gain fitness advantages in
   a more realistic dominance hierarchy, despite being outranked by the
   rival with which they were paired in our study. Results highlight
   intraspecific variation in behavioural correlations and the importance
   of social environment in shaping integrated phenotypes.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},
Pages = {{1589-1610}},
Abstract = {{Physiological stress responses often correlate with personalities (e.g.,
   boldness). However, this relationship can become decoupled, although the
   mechanisms underlying changes in this relationship are poorly
   understood. Here we quantify (1) how an individual's boldness (response
   to novel objects) in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, changes in
   response to interactions with a population of either bold or shy
   conspecifics and we (2) measured associated post-stress cortisol levels.
   Initially-bold trout became shyer regardless of group composition,
   whereas shy trout remained shy demonstrating that bold individuals are
   more plastic. Stress-induced plasma cortisol reflected the original
   personality of fish but not the personality induced by the treatment,
   irrespective of population personality. Change in boldness of bold trout
   may indicate preference towards initially subordinate behaviour when
   joining a new population. However, here we provide further evidence that
   behavioural and physiological parameters of coping styles may become
   uncoupled whereby behavioural changes are not correlated with stress
   responsiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in animal behaviour are an
   increasingly common focus of research across various behavioural and
   biological sciences. Such `animal personalities' comprise a diverse
   repertoire of behavioural tendencies, recently expanding to incorporate
   the social domain. Aggression and peace, hallmarks of many social
   systems including that of humans, warrant integration with this
   literature. Specifically, animal personality research should consider
   the potential role of stable conflict and post-conflict behavioural
   tendencies. We focus our discussion primarily on examples in nonhuman
   primates and humans, but suggest that individual variation patterns are
   relevant for any social species in which these phenomena exist. In
   highly gregarious species, an individual's conflict and post-conflict
   tendencies can affect the strength and stability of its social bonds.
   Because social relationships in turn impact survival and reproductive
   success, we also encourage future work to investigate the ultimate
   (i.e., fitness-relevant) consequences of individual variation in
   aggressive and peaceful behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Two recent observations in behavioral biology have sparked great
   interest and have already yielded many novel and intriguing insights.
   Bacteria appear to live lives of unforeseen behavioral complexity, and
   the consistent behavioral variation among individual animals is often
   not ``noise{''} but turns out to be a highly relevant ecological and
   evolutionary feature in itself. Research covering these 2 phenomena has
   proceeded largely in isolation, and the rich behavioral lives of
   bacteria have not yet been studied with consistent interindividual
   behavioral differences in mind. Yet, the parallels between animal and
   bacterial behavior that are increasingly being uncovered, as well as the
   particular characteristics of bacteria, point toward a new approach in
   the study of consistent individual variation in behavior. Using bacteria
   can bring fruitful opportunities to the field and allows researchers to
   address questions that are very difficult to pursue using animal model
   systems. Notwithstanding a few challenges, bacteria can provide an
   alternative study system that may elucidate several evolutionary and
   ecological aspects of consistent individual behavioral variation.}},

Abstract = {{The Norway rat is an indispensable model organism. Behavioral studies on
   rats usually concentrate on a single trait without considering how
   different behaviors are linked to each other and whether there are
   differences in this respect between rat strains or sexes. This study
   aims to describe the personality structure of the Norway rat, and
   investigate if the structure of personality varies between sexes or
   populations, using owner assessments of pet rats. Rat owners from three
   countries filled out a questionnaire which was analyzed using structural
   equation modeling. The data were divided between the sexes and
   populations, resulting in six groups. Preliminary exploratory factor
   analysis was first conducted on the most numerous group to form a
   hypothesis about the personality structure, after which confirmatory
   factor analysis was used to discover differences between groups. A three
   factor model consisting of the components activity, tameness and
   anxiousness fit all groups. Both quantitative and qualitative
   differences were found between sexes, especially with respect to the
   trait activity. If neglected, the sex differences compromise the
   generality and reliability of behavioral research on rats. Population
   differences were negligible. The results underline the importance of
   considering the sex of the animal as well as its individual
   characteristics when assessing its wellbeing, behavioral requirements or
   suitability for a certain task or research experiment. Using a method
   adopted from human personality research produced meaningful results
   consistent with previous reports on rodent personality. (C) 2011

Volume = {{148}},

Pages = {{1473-1489}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences, often referred to as behavioral
   syndromes, are characterized by individuals behaving in a consistent,
   predictable manner while differing from others. This phenomenon appears
   to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or
   changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even
   exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time
   they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few
   studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of
   consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta
   splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with
   a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these
   responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined
   how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of
   conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics.
   Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as
   after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of
   behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter
   their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with
   the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after
   exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed
   behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher
   repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more
   resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral
   strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral
   flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how
   experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in
   both courtship and aggressive situations.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has seen the emergence of two new developments in
   behavioural ecology: the discovery of animal personalities and a new
   approach to the analyses of animal behaviour, biological markets.
   Although both regard individual differences in behaviour as adaptive in
   their own right these two developments appear, at first glance, to be
   opposing approaches to analysing animal behaviour. Personalities consist
   of suites of behaviours that are correlated across situations (e.g. some
   animals are consistently more or less aggressive across situations than
   other animals) and assumes that animals are limited in their response to
   their environment. By contrast, the biological market approach considers
   organisms as traders of commodities (e.g. food or grooming) where the
   exchange rates of commodities changes with time and is influenced by
   shifts in the abundance and demand for the commodity, as happens in
   human markets. Biological markets thus view animal behaviour as
   extremely plastic whereas the putative existence of animal personalities
   suggests that animal behaviour may be relatively inflexible. However,
   the two approaches maybe more similar than heretofore realized and may
   be complementary rather than opposing. Here I briefly review each
   approach and show how animal personalities can arise from a biological
   market situation.}},

Abstract = {{Energy metabolism has received much attention as a potential driver of
   repeatable among-individual differences in behaviour (animal
   personality). Several factors have been hypothesized to mediate this
   relationship. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of
   >70 studies comprised of >8000 individuals reporting relationships
   between measures of maintenance metabolic rates (i.e. basal metabolic
   rate, resting metabolic rate, and standard metabolic rate) and
   behaviour. We evaluated support for three hypothesized mediators: (i)
   type of behaviour, (ii) opportunities for energy re-allocation, and
   (iii) magnitude of energetic constraints. Relationships between measures
   of maintenance metabolic rate (MR) and behaviour are predicted to be
   strongest for behaviours with strong consequences for energy turnover
   (acquisition or expenditure). Consistent with this, we found that
   behaviours with known consequences for energy gain (e.g. foraging,
   dominance, boldness) or expenditure (e.g. maximum sprint speed,
   sustained running speed, maximum distance travelled, etc.) had strong
   positive correlations with MR, while behaviours with putatively weak
   and/or inconsistent associations with net energy gain or loss (e.g.
   exploration, activity, sociability) were not correlated with MR. Greater
   opportunities for energy reallocation are predicted to weaken
   relationships between MR and behaviour by creating alternative pathways
   to balance energy budgets. We tested this by contrasting relationships
   between MR and behaviour in ectotherms versus endotherms, as
   thermoregulation in endotherms creates additional opportunities for
   energy reallocation compared with ectotherms. As predicted, the
   relationship between behaviour and MR was stronger in ectotherms
   compared with endotherms. However, statistical analyses of heterogeneity
   among effect sizes from different species did not support energy
   re-allocation as the main driver of these differences. Finally, we
   tested whether conditions where animals face greater constraints in
   meeting their energy budgets (e.g. field versus laboratory, breeding
   versus non-breeding) increased the strength of the relationship between
   MR and behaviour. We found that the relationship between MR and
   behaviour was unaffected by either of these modifiers. This
   meta-analysis provides two key insights. First, we observed positive
   relationships of similar magnitude between MR and behaviours that bring
   in net energy, and behaviours that cost net energy. This result is only
   consistent with a performance energy-management model. Given that the
   studies included in our meta-analysis represent a wide range of taxa,
   this suggests that the performance model may be the most common model in
   general. Second, we found that behaviours with putatively weak or
   inconsistent consequences for net energy gain or expenditure
   (exploration, activity, sociability) show no relationship with MR. The
   lack of relationship between MR and behavioural traits with weak and/or
   inconsistent consequences for energy turnover provides the first
   systematic demonstration of the central importance of the ecological
   function of traits in mediating relationships between MR and behaviour.}},

Title = {{Dominance in dogs as rated by owners corresponds to ethologically valid
   markers of dominance}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Dominance is well defined in ethology, debated in psychology, and is
   often unclear among the dog owning public and in the press. However, to
   date, no study has examined how owners perceive dominance in dogs, and
   what different behaviours and personality types are used to describe
   dominant and subordinate individuals. A questionnaire study was launched
   to investigate the external validity of owner-derived estimates of
   dominance in dog dyads sharing the same household (N = 1,151). According
   to the owners, dogs rated as dominant (87\%) have priority access to
   resources (resting place, food, and rewards), undertake certain tasks
   (defend and lead the group, bark more), display dominance (win fights,
   lick the other's mouth less, and mark over the other's urine), share
   certain personality traits (smarter, more aggressive and impulsive), and
   are older than their partner dog (all p < 0.0001). An age-related
   hypothesis has been suggested to explain dominance in dogs; but we found
   that dog age did not explain the occurrence of dominance related
   behaviours over the owners' estimate of dominance status. Results
   suggest that owner-derived reports of dominance ranks of dogs living in
   multi-dog households correspond to ethologically valid behavioural
   markers of dominance. Size and physical condition were unrelated to the
   perceived dominance. Surprisingly, in mixed-sex dyads, females were more
   frequently rated as dominant than males, which might correspond to a
   higher proportion of neutered females in this subgroup. For future
   studies that wish to allocate dominance status using owner report, we
   offer a novel survey.}},

   nest defense behavior}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Animals are thought to adjust the intensity of their parental defense to
   fitness benefits associated with their current reproduction. They should
   be more defensive when they breed early in the season, when they produce
   more young, or as their young get older. Beyond these plastic changes,
   associations among traits could be explained by consistent
   among-individual differences. Separating the mechanisms at the origin of
   behavioral phenotypic variation is essential to understand the
   determinants and evolution of parental care. During four breeding
   seasons, we investigated whether variation in Canada goose (Branta
   canadensis) nest defense resulted from individual short-term plastic
   adjustments to reproductive stage within breeding seasons, plastic
   adjustments to brood value across breeding seasons, or from long-term
   among-individual differences. We thus estimated the among- and
   within-individual relationships between nest defense, clutch size, and
   laying date. Female and male nest defense behaviors were highly
   repeatable in time (R=0.72 and 0.67 on the short term). At the
   among-individual level, we found no significant association between
   female nest defense and life history traits, but the more defensive
   males were mated with the more fecund females. Female and male nest
   defense was not adjusted to annual variation in laying date nor in
   clutch size. However, females adjusted their nest defense within each
   breeding season and became more defensive when approaching egg hatching.
   Thus, Canada goose nest defense behavior is partly explained by plastic
   adjustments, but also by consistent among-individual differences which
   indicate the evolutionary potential of nest defense
   behavior.Significance statementAn association between traits at the
   phenotypic level can be partitioned into association at the among- and
   within-individual levels. This allows to better understand covariation
   of traits resulting from both among-individual differences and
   phenotypic plasticity. We observed 141 Canada goose pairs to identify
   what affected the intensity of their nest defense behavior. We found
   that geese were very consistent in their nest defense behavior and that
   female fecundity was related to male personality. Females also became
   more defensive as their young got older. Analyzing different sources of

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits influence habitat choice,
   and in turn, differences in used habitats shape different behavioural
   tendencies through plasticity. Here, I investigated the relationship
   between personality and microhabitat use in a free-living population of
   the clonal gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris. The study site is a small
   beachfront forest facing two environments with contrasting levels of
   human disturbance. I conducted a mark-recapture survey to assess the
   geckos' spacing pattern and evaluated their boldness and exploration
   scores in the laboratory. The geckos exhibited a small range of movement
   and a high consistency in their perch height. Boldness was related to
   two microhabitat features, but exploration was not. Relatively shy
   geckos were found in trees near the roadside and on low branches,
   whereas relatively bold geckos were found on both the beachside and the
   roadside and on low to high branches. These patterns suggest that geckos
   in high-disturbance microhabitats may have frequently experienced
   artificial stimuli and become shy. However, the present results cannot
   exclude the possibility that individual differences are caused by other
   factors and that different personality types prefer and settle in
   different microhabitats. Although the actual mechanisms are unclear, my
   findings highlight that behaviour-related habitat use emerges even in
   clonal animals.Significance statementIndividuals within conspecifics
   show different spacing patterns and different behavioural tendencies. If
   clonal animals live in a spatially diverse environment, it is predicted
   that different microhabitats may gradually shape different personality
   types through developmental plasticity. Here, I investigated the
   association between the personality of clonal geckos and their
   microhabitat use in different levels of human disturbance. In contrast
   to the prediction, both juveniles and adults showed a similar pattern of
   boldness-related microhabitats; relatively shy individuals were found in
   putatively high-disturbance sites. This result suggests that the
   association between boldness and microhabitats is not gradually formed
   through a long-time scale but is likely generated within their early
   ontogenetic stage.}},

Title = {{Nest-site defence aggression during courtship does not predict nestling
   provisioning in male collared flycatchers}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Individuals of many animal species show consistent differences in
   ecologically relevant behaviours, and these individual-specific
   behaviours can correlate with each other. In passerines, aggression
   during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been
   steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in
   several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive
   investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males
   toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care.
   This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice,
   they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality.
   We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity
   of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for
   aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not
   related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between
   the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their
   mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the
   parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does
   not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that
   higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males
   often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male
   testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the
   parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in
   territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling
   provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in
   distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further
   investigation.Significance statementMale songbirds, when attracting
   mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these
   male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance
   during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a
   male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour
   as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated
   the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding
   activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated
   territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded
   their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that
   territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate.
   This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the
   breeding season does not carry information for females about what to
   expect from potential mates in terms of parental care.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative study of animal personality has received great interest
   in recent years. Some studies have analyzed personalities in cetaceans
   (exclusively in dolphins), but none have analyzed the factorial
   structure of personality of any species in this order. Our objective was
   to evaluate a sample of captive killer whales (n = 24) adapting one of
   the most widely used models of personality in humans and nonhuman
   animals: the five-factor model. A total of 38 personality descriptive
   adjectives were rated by 55 raters (mainly trainers and curators).
   Principal components analysis and regularized exploratory factor
   analysis revealed four statistically significant factors with acceptable
   standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 49.85\%
   of the variance. The first factor indicated an Extraversion factor, the
   second one revealed a combined factor of Conscientiousness and
   Agreeableness, the third one yielded in a Dominance factor, and the
   fourth one reflected a Careful factor very close to a combination of
   Conscientiousness and Agreeableness factor. The results were compared
   with the results obtained for humans and chimpanzees in prior studies.
   The similarities could be explained as a result of convergent adaptive
   traits despite a deep evolutionary divergence, adaptation to physically
   dissimilar environments, and very different neuroanatomical
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of individual behaviour as a function of environmental
   variation (behavioural plasticity) is recognized as a means for animals
   to modify their phenotypes in response to changing conditions.
   Plasticity has been studied extensively in recent years, leading to an
   accumulation of evidence for behavioural plasticity within natural
   populations. Despite the recent attention given to studying individual
   variation in behavioural plasticity, there is still a lack of consensus
   regarding its causes and constraints. One pressing question related to
   this is whether individual plasticity carries over across temporal and
   environmental gradients. That is, are some individuals more plastic
   (responsive) than others in general? Here, we examined the influence of
   temporal and environmental gradients on individual behavioural responses
   in a marine gastropod, Littoraria irrorata. We measured individual
   boldness repeatedly over time and in response to tidal cycle (high vs.
   low, an index of risk) and daily temperature fluctuations (known to
   affect metabolism), in a controlled field experiment. On average,
   boldness increased from high to low tide and with increasing temperature
   but decreased marginally over time. Individuals also differed in their
   responses to variation in tide and temperature, but not over time. Those
   which were relatively bold at high tide (when predation risk is greater)
   were similarly bold at low tide, whereas shy individuals became much
   more bold at low tide. Most notably, individuals that were more
   responsive to tide (and thus risk) were also more responsive to
   temperature changes, indicating that plasticity was correlated across
   contexts (r=0.57) and that bolder individuals were least plastic
   overall. This study provides a rare and possibly first example of
   consistency of individual behavioural plasticity across contexts,
   suggesting underlying physiology as a common mechanism, and raises the
   possibility of correlational selection on plasticity.}},

Title = {{Evidence of high individual variability in seed management by
   scatter-hoarding rodents: does `personality' matter?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{150}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The predation and dispersal of seeds by scatter-hoarding animals is one
   of the most studied processes in the context of animal-plant
   interactions. Seed management by these animals has been traditionally
   approached at the population level: the patterns documented in the field
   are assumed to be similar for all individuals of the population and the
   variability within the population is considered to be random noise.
   However, little is known about to what extent this variability responds
   to different and consistent behaviours between individuals. The aim of
   this study was to analyse the individual variation and consistency in
   behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents within a population. As our model
   we used the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a key disperser of holm oak
   acorns, Quercus ilex, which, in turn, suffers high predation pressure by
   the common genet, Genetta genetta. In two sets of laboratory
   experiments, we compared the variance and consistency in behaviours and
   acorn management due to individual differences with that due to
   manipulation, using genet scents, of the perceived predation risk. Genet
   scents reduced the activity (i.e. time out of the refuge) in all wood
   mice, but the differences and consistency in activity between
   individuals accounted for most of the variance. Also, mice showed
   different and consistent stress or relaxed behaviours. Most of the
   variance in seed management variables, such as dispersal distance and
   seed size selection, was explained by consistent differences between
   individuals across scent treatments. The increase in stress behaviours
   and decrease in relaxed behaviours were positively related to dispersal
   ability (i.e. longer distances and larger acorns). Our study highlights
   the importance of considering the individual component of behaviour in
   scatter-hoarding rodents. This fine-scale level, largely overlooked in
   the ecological framework, will help to increase our understanding of
   seed management by scatter-hoarding animals. (C) 2019 The Association

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF NATURE}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on animal personality evaluate individual mean behaviour to
   describe individual behavioural strategy, while often neglecting
   behavioural variability on the within-individual level. However,
   within-individual behavioural plasticity (variation induced by
   environment) and within-individual residual variation (regulatory
   behavioural precision) are recognized as biologically valid components
   of individual behaviour, but the evolutionary ecology of these
   components is still less understood. Here, we tested whether behaviour
   of common pill bugs (Armadillidium vulgare) differs on the among- and
   within-individual level and whether it is affected by various individual
   specific state-related traits (sex, size and Wolbachia infection). To
   this aim, we assayed risk-taking in familiar vs. unfamiliar environments
   30 times along 38days and applied double modelling statistical technique
   to handle the complex hierarchical structure for both
   individual-specific trait means and variances. We found that there are
   significant among-individual differences not only in mean risk-taking
   behaviour but also in environment- and time-induced behavioural
   plasticity and residual variation. Wolbachia-infected individuals took
   less risk than healthy conspecifics; in addition, individuals became
   more risk-averse with time. Residual variation decreased with time, and
   individuals expressed higher residual variation in the unfamiliar
   environment. Further, sensitization was stronger in females and in
   larger individuals in general. Our results suggest that among-individual
   variation, behavioural plasticity and residual variation are all (i)
   biologically relevant components of an individual's behavioural strategy
   and (ii) responsive to changes in environment or labile state variables.
   We propose pill bugs as promising models for personality research due to
   the relative ease of getting repeated behavioural measurements.}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Stable between-group differences in collective behavior have been
   documented in a variety of social taxa. Here we evaluate the effects of
   such variation, often termed collective or colony-level personality, on
   coral recovery in a tropical marine farmerfish system. Groups of the
   farmerfish Stegastes nigricans cultivate and defend gardens of palatable
   algae on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. These gardens can promote the
   recruitment, growth, and survival of corals by providing a refuge from
   coral predation. Here we experimentally evaluate whether the collective
   response of farmerfish colonies is correlated across intruder feeding
   guilds - herbivores, corallivores and egg-eating predators. Further, we
   evaluate if overall colony responsiveness or situation-specific
   responsiveness (i.e. towards herbivores, corallivores, or egg-eaters in
   particular) best predicts the growth of outplanted corals. Finally, we
   experimentally manipulated communities within S. nigricans gardens,
   adding either macroalgae or large colonies of coral, to assess if
   farmerfish behavior changes in response to the communities they occupy.
   Between-group differences in collective responsiveness were repeatable
   across intruder guilds. Despite this consistency, responsiveness towards
   corallivores (porcupinefish and ornate butterflyfish) was a better
   predictor of outplanted coral growth than responsiveness towards
   herbivores or egg-eaters. Adding large corals to farmerfish gardens
   increased farmerfish attacks towards intruders, pointing to possible
   positive feedback loops between their aggression towards intruders and
   the presence of corals whose growth they facilitate. These data provide
   evidence that among-group behavioral variation could strongly influence
   the ecological properties of whole communities.}},

Title = {{Behavioural syndromes as a link between ecology and mate choice: a field
   study in a reef fish population}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{219-237}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The link between ecology and reproductive isolation constitutes the
   cornerstone of the ecological hypothesis of speciation. Such a link can
   arise when traits under ecologically based selection are also used as
   cues for mating ('magic traits') or as a by-product of habitat choice
   when mating takes place within habitats. Here, we propose that
   behavioural syndromes may also constitute such a link. We illustrate
   this mechanism in the butter hamlet, Hypoplectrus unicolor, a reef fish
   from the wider Caribbean, with aggressive mimicry as the focal
   ecological trait. Aggressive mimicry is of particular interest in
   hamlets since it has been proposed to play a key role in the radiation
   of Hypoplectrus. Individuals from a natural population in Bocas del
   Toro, Panama, were tagged and their diurnal and spawning behaviours
   observed over 2 years. The results indicate that aggressive mimicry
   behaviour differed consistently between individuals and formed two
   discrete behavioural types that also differed with respect to
   territoriality. Differences in territoriality between the two
   behavioural types translated into different use of space in spawning
   contexts, which generated a tendency for assortative mating by
   behavioural type. This case study illustrates how behavioural syndromes
   may form a link between ecologically relevant behavioural traits and
   mate choice, suggesting that they might play an underappreciated role in
   the early stages of speciation. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study

Title = {{Laboratory captivity can affect scores of metabolic rates and activity

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{307}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{249-255}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic scoring of wild animals under standardized laboratory
   conditions is important as it allows field ecologists and evolutionary
   biologists to understand the development and maintenance of
   interindividual differences in plastic traits (e.g. behaviour and
   physiology). However, captivity is associated with a shift from a
   natural familiar environment to an unfamiliar and artificial
   environment, which may affect estimates of plastic phenotypic traits. In
   this study, we tested how previous experience with laboratory
   environments and time spent in captivity affects behavioural (i.e.
   activity) and metabolic (i.e. standard and maximum metabolic rates)
   scoring of our model species, wild brown trout Salmo trutta. We found
   that individuals with previous experience of laboratory captivity (10.5
   months earlier) showed higher activity in an open field test than
   individuals with no prior experience of laboratory captivity. Previous
   experience with captivity had no significant effect on metabolic rates.
   However, metabolic rates seemed to increase with increasing time spent
   in captivity prior to the collection of measurements. Although there are
   benefits of keeping wild animals in captivity prior to scoring, our
   results suggest that while allowing for sufficient acclimatization
   researchers should aim at minimizing time in captivity of wild animals
   to increase accuracy and ecological relevance of the scoring of plastic
   phenotypic traits.}},

Title = {{Personality and plasticity in neophobia levels vary with anthropogenic
   disturbance but not toxic metal exposure in urban great tits Urban
   disturbance, metal pollution and neophobia}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{656}},
Pages = {{997-1009}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities, as defined by repeatable among individual
   differences in behavior, can vary across urbanization gradients.
   However, how urbanization affects personalities remains incompletely
   understood, especially because different urban stressors could affect
   personality traits in opposing ways, whereas most previous studies have
   considered only one urban disturbance factor. For instance, novel
   habitat features could favor reduced neophobia, whereas exposure to
   pollutants could increase risk sensitivity through neurotoxic or
   hormonal effects. To address this contingency, we studied object
   neophobia in four urban populations of great tits (Parus major) that
   vary in exposure to metal pollution and anthropogenic disturbance, as
   quantified by proximity to roads and pathways. We measured the return
   latency of incubating females when flushed from the nest and presented
   with up to two different novel objects, allowing quantification of
   behavioral repeatability and plasticity. To separate neophobia from
   sensitivity to disturbance, we also conducted baseline trials, in which
   females were flushed but no object was presented. We additionally
   measured exploration behavior and aggression (hissing) during nest
   defense, to explore whether suites of behaviors covary with
   urbanization, and examined whether neophobia affects reproductive
   success. Sensitivity to disturbance and neophobia were repeatable, and
   thus represent personality traits. Moreover, females occupying
   territories near roads and pathways had shorter return latencies during
   novel object but not baseline trials, suggesting a specific reduction in
   neophobia in disturbed areas. Plasticity in neophobia also increased
   with disturbance level. In contrast, metal exposure did not affect
   neophobia or sensitivity to disturbance, despite negatively correlating
   with exploration behavior. Neophobia correlated with exploration
   behavior, but not aggression or reproductive success. Results suggest
   that shifts in personality types in urbanized areas might involve
   specific reductions in neophobia, rather than general reductions in
   sensitivity to disturbance, and unexpectedly indicate no effect of toxic
   metals on risk sensitivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have examined the average effects of ocean acidification
   and warming on phenotypic traits of reef fishes, finding variable, but
   often negative effects on behavioural and physiological performance.Yet
   the presence and nature of a relationship between these traits is
   unknown. A negative relationship between phenotypic traits could limit
   individual performance and even the capacity of populations to adapt to
   climate change. Here, we examined the relationship between behavioural
   and physiological performance of a juvenile reef fish under elevated CO2
   and temperature in a full factorial design. Behaviourally, the response
   to an alarm odour was negatively affected by elevated CO2, but not
   elevated temperature. Physiologically, aerobic scope was significantly
   diminished under elevated temperature, but not under elevated CO2. At
   the individual level, there was no relationship between behavioural and
   physiological traits in the control and sing le-stressor treatments.
   However, a statistically significant negative relationship was detected
   between the traits in the combined elevated CO(2 )and temperature
   treatment. Our results demonstrate that trade-offs in performance
   between behavioural and physiological traits may only be evident when
   multiple climate change stressors are considered, and suggest that this
   negative relationship could limit adaptive potential to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is known to influence the mean behavioral
   phenotype of a population. Yet, studies on how developmental plasticity
   shapes patterns of variation within populations are comparatively rare
   and often focus on a subset of developmental cues (e.g., nutrition). One
   potentially important but understudied developmental experience is
   social experience, as it is explicitly hypothesized to increase
   variation among individuals as a way to promote social niches. To test
   this, we exposed juvenile black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) to
   the silk of conspecifics by transplanting them onto conspecific webs for
   48 h once a week until adulthood. We also utilized an untouched control
   group as well as a disturbed group. This latter group was removed from
   their web at the same time points as the social treatment, but was
   immediately placed back on their own web. After repeatedly measuring
   adult behavior and web structure, we found that social rearing drove
   higher or significant levels of repeatability relative to the other
   treatments. Repeatability in the social treatment also decreased in some
   traits, paralleling the decreases observed in the disturbed treatments.
   Thus, repeated juvenile disturbance may decrease among-individual
   differences in adult spiders. Yet, social rearing appeared to override
   the effect of disturbance in some traits, suggesting a prioritization
   effect. The resulting individual differences were maintained over at
   least one-third of the adult lifespan and thus appear to represent
   stable, canalized developmental effects and not temporal state
   differences. These results provide proximate insight into how a broader
   range of developmental experiences shape trait variation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how animal personality (consistent between-individual
   behavioural differences) arises has become a central topic in
   behavioural sciences. This endeavour is complicated by the fact that not
   only the mean behaviour of individuals (behavioural type) but also the
   strength of their reaction to environmental change (behavioural
   plasticity) varies consistently. Personality and cognitive abilities are
   linked, and we suggest that behavioural plasticity could also be
   explained by differences in brain size (a proxy for cognitive
   abilities), since accurate decisions are likely essential to make
   behavioural plasticity beneficial. We test this idea in guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata), artificially selected for large and small brain
   size, which show clear cognitive differences between selection lines. To
   test whether those lines differed in behavioural plasticity, we reared
   them in groups in structurally enriched environments and then placed
   adults individually into empty tanks, where we presented them daily with
   visual predator cues and monitored their behaviour for 20 days with
   video-aided motion tracking. We found that individuals differed
   consistently in activity and risk-taking, as well as in behavioural
   plasticity. In activity, only the large-brained lines demonstrated
   habituation (increased activity) to the new environment, whereas in
   risk-taking, we found sensitization (decreased risk-taking) in both
   brain size lines. We conclude that brain size, potentially via
   increasing cognitive abilities, may increase behavioural plasticity,
   which in turn can improve habituation to novel environments. However,
   the effects seem to be behaviour-specific. Our results suggest that
   brain size likely explains some of the variation in behavioural
   plasticity found at the intraspecific level.}},

Abstract = {{A key goal in the study of animal personalities is to determine their
   adaptive potential and importance for behavioral evolution. Behavioral
   syndromes are evolutionarily intriguing because they suggest that an
   adaptive change in one behavior requires a concomitant shift in another.
   Within species, behavioral syndromes might be evolutionarily constrained
   by intrinsic mechanisms that restrict behaviors from evolving
   independently. Alternatively, behavioral correlations might easily be
   decoupled over short evolutionary time scales due to variation in
   selective pressures between environments. In this regard, comparative
   studies that explore differences in diverse aspects of personality
   between geographically distinct populations can provide valuable
   insights into the evolutionary processes acting on different behavioral
   tendencies. Accordingly, we investigated how behavioral types and
   behavioral syndromes differed across four geographically distinct
   populations of the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. We found
   strong evidence of mean trait-level variation in activity, exploration,
   and boldness across populations, suggesting adaptation to local
   environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that within-population
   correlations involving boldness varied substantially between
   populations. However, we did find a consistent within- and
   among-population correlation between activity and exploration,
   suggesting that this behavioral syndrome is relatively stable and could
   explain behavioral divergence in activity and exploration between
   populations. We suggest that there may be thermal physiological
   mechanisms that could be limiting the adaptive potential of an
   activity-exploration correlation in the delicate skink. Broadly, we
   argue that some behavioral correlations may be more adaptive than
   others, and that this should be more regularly considered within the
   animal personality framework.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies increasingly show that personality types in animals can
   vary with time. Personality types including boldness and aggression have
   been recently reported as important determinants of collective task
   performance, task specialisation and task proficiency in social spiders.
   These studies were performed in subadult and adult spiders and over the
   short term (3-15days). Therefore, the ontogeny of these personality
   types and its persistence over timescales relevant to the lifespan of
   any social spider species remains unknown. In the social spider
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum, we investigated 1) if early instar juveniles
   exhibited consistent and repeatable personality types, 2) if personality
   types persisted over the long term in subadults and 3) if personality
   types are influenced by subadult body condition. Juveniles (3rd and 4th
   instars) showed consistent inter-individual differences and
   repeatability in boldness and aggression (across 21days). Subadults
   showed consistency in boldness and aggression over a duration of 51days,
   which covers a significant part of the subadult stage. However,
   repeatability of these traits declined over the long term. Moreover,
   boldness and aggression were not influenced by body condition
   (nutritional state) of subadults. Thus, we hypothesise that the early
   ontogeny of personality and its long-term persistence can influence
   behavioural propensities and task partitioning through later life stages
   in social spider colonies.Significance statementPersonalities have been
   demonstrated in a number of animal species. In animal societies,
   individuals with different personality types are known to engage in
   different activities within the group, leading to overall efficiency.
   Personalities have recently been shown to exist in social spiders. For
   example, aggressive spiders have a greater tendency to hunt prey than
   less aggressive individuals. However, for most animals, it remains
   unknown whether personality types manifest in very young individuals.
   Here, we show for the first time in social spiders that juveniles have
   personalities just as in adults. We also show that personality types
   persist over significant portions of individuals' life spans. These
   findings show that stable personality types can be important in
   collective tasks such as capturing prey.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decades, the study of ``animal personalities{''} has
   gained increasing importance in the field of behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology, thereby contributing to a focus shift from the

   this background, the overall idea of the present review is to transfer
   the personality concept from behavioural ecology to animal welfare
   science, to discuss the role of the individual in different research
   approaches and to pave new grounds for a more individual-tailored
   assessment and treatment of welfare-related problems. Moreover, we will
   explicitly refer to welfare issues ``beyond the average{''}, thereby
   addressing problems that are not entirely covered by simply studying
   personality traits in animal welfare research. By combining two
   different fields, we hope to stimulate more theoretical and empirical
   work on this topic to find new ways of improving the welfare of animals

Abstract = {{The social environment is expected to have substantial effects on
   behavior, and as a consequence, its heritability and evolvability. We
   investigated these effects by exposing Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to either silence or recordings of male
   acoustic sexual signals. We used a combined pedigree and
   full-sib/half-sib breeding design to estimate the repeatability,
   heritability, and evolvability of behaviors related to boldness,
   exploration, and activity. All behaviors measured were significantly
   repeatable in both social environments. Additionally, most behaviors
   showed significant heritabilities in the two environments. We found no
   difference in repeatabilities between the silent and the acoustic
   environment but did find significant differences in the heritabilities
   and evolvabilities between these environments. There was a high degree
   of similarity between the phenotypic covariance matrices across the two
   environments, while the genotypic covariance matrices were highly
   dissimilar. Reflecting this, we found significant
   genotype-by-environment interactions for most of the behaviors. Lastly,
   we found that the repeatable aspect of behavior ({''}personality{''})
   was significantly heritable for most behaviors, but that these
   heritabilities were higher in the acoustic than in the silent
   environment. We conclude that the social environment can have a
   significant impact on the heritability and evolvability of behavior, and
   argue that evolutionary inferences from phenotypic studies should be
   made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Personality-dependent space use and movement might be crucially
   influencing ecological interactions, giving way to individual niche
   specialization. This new approach challenges classical niche theory with
   potentially great ecological consequences, but so far has only scarce
   empirical support. Here, we investigated if and how consistent
   inter-individual differences in behavior predict space use and movement
   patterns in free-ranging bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and thereby
   contribute to individual niche specialization. Individuals were captured
   and marked from three different subpopulations in North-East Germany.
   Inter-individual differences in boldness and exploration were quantified
   via repeated standardized tests directly in the field after capture.
   Subsequently, space use and movement patterns of a representative sample
   of the behavioral variation (n=21 individuals) were monitored via
   automated VHF telemetry for a period of four days, yielding on average
   384 locations per individual. Bolder individuals occupied larger home
   ranges and core areas (estimated via kernel density analyses), moved
   longer distances, spatially overlapped with fewer conspecifics and
   preferred different microhabitats based on vegetation cover compared to
   shyer individuals. We found evidence for personality-dependent space
   use, movement, and occupation of individual spatial niches in bank
   voles. Thus, besides dietary niche specialization also spatial
   dimensions of ecological niches vary among individuals within
   populations, which may have important consequences for ecological
   interactions within- and between species.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3434-3445}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental goal of evolutionary ecology is to identify the sources
   underlying trait variation on which selection can act. Phenotypic
   variation will be determined by both genetic and environmental factors,
   and adaptive phenotypic plasticity is expected when organisms can adjust
   their phenotypes to match environmental cues. Much recent research
   interest has focused on the relative importance of environmental and
   genetic factors on the expression of behavioral traits, in particular,
   and how they compare with morphological and life-history traits. Little
   research to date examines the effect of development on the expression of
   heritable variation in behavioral traits, such as boldness and activity.
   We tested for genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment
   differences in body mass, development time, boldness, and activity,
   using developmental density treatments combined with a quantitative
   genetic design in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Similar to
   results from previous work, animals reared at high densities were
   generally smaller and took longer to mature, and body mass and
   development time were moderately heritable. In contrast, neither
   boldness nor activity responded to density treatments, and they were not
   heritable. The only trait that showed significant
   genotype-by-environment differences was development time. It is possible
   that adaptive behavioral plasticity is not evident in this species
   because of the highly variable social environments it naturally
   experiences. Our results illustrate the importance of validating the
   assumption that behavioral phenotype reflects genetic patterns and
   suggest questions about the role of environmental instability in trait
   variation and heritability.}},

Title = {{Personality traits influence contest outcome, and vice versa, in a
   territorial butterfly}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Holding a territory is often crucial in order to acquire key resources,
   including mating partners. However, few studies have investigated the
   role of animal personality in the context of territorial conflicts and
   how the contest outcome itself may influence personality traits. We
   studied personality in male Speckled wood butterflies, Pararge aegeria,
   before and after territorial contests for sunspot territories. Before
   interactions, boldness decreased with age, while activity and
   exploration were only influenced by ambient conditions. Neither age nor
   morphology did influence the probability to win contests, but winners
   were more active and more explorative than losers and, moreover, males
   that received a red wing mark were more likely to be winners.
   Butterflies that lost a contest showed pronounced behavioural changes.
   Mean boldness increased and its repeatability was disrupted, while no
   such change was detected in winners. The observed boldness increase in
   losers may be explained by a `desperado effect', though its implication
   for successive contests remains unknown. Given that territoriality is
   expected to have important consequences for reproductive success, our
   results suggest that personality traits may indirectly contribute to
   individual fitness by influencing the ability to gain access to
   mate-location patches.}},

Abstract = {{When deciding between different options, animals including humans face
   the dilemma that fast decisions tend to be erroneous, whereas accurate
   decisions tend to be relatively slow. Recently, it has been suggested
   that differences in the efficacy with which animals make a decision
   relate closely to individual behavioural differences. In this paper, we
   tested this hypothesis in a unique unicellular organism, the slime mould
   Physarum polycephalum. We first confirmed that slime moulds differed
   consistently in their exploratory behaviour from `fast' to `slow'
   explorers. Second, we showed that slow explorers made more accurate
   decisions than fast explorers. Third, we demonstrated that slime moulds
   integrated food cues in time and achieved higher accuracy when sampling
   time was longer. Lastly, we showed that in a competition context, fast
   explorers excelled when a single food source was offered, while slow
   explorers excelled when two food sources varying in quality were
   offered. Our results revealed that individual differences in accuracy
   were partly driven by differences in exploratory behaviour. These
   findings support the hypothesis that decision-making abilities are
   associated with behavioural types, even in unicellular organisms.}},

   Dicentrarchus labrax}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{222}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Periods of food deprivation of several months are common events for
   fishes and in such conditions, fitness will be determined by their
   capacity to maximize food encounters while minimizing predation risk. In
   this context, the propensity to take risks and the willingness to
   associate with conspecifics are particularly important as they
   contribute to alleviating the trade-off between predation avoidance and
   foraging efficiency. This study examined to what extent food deprivation
   modulates fish risk-taking and social behaviours, as well as the
   relationship between them. To address these issues, juvenile European
   sea bass were either fed daily with a maintenance ration or food
   deprived for a period of 3 weeks. Risk taking and sociability were
   assessed through measurements of fish willingness to explore a novel
   environment, and to interact with a novel object or a conspecific.
   Multivariate analysis allowed the identification of three behaviours:
   risk taking, exploratory activity and solitariness. Food-deprived fish
   interacted less with conspecifics than control fish; however, no
   difference in terms of risk taking and exploratory patterns was
   observed. Finally, the relationship between risk taking and solitariness
   was influenced by feeding status. When food-deprived, fish with a higher
   propensity to take risk displayed increased solitariness, while when fed
   normally, they interacted more with conspecifics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{173-181}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Standard metabolic rate (SMR) is known to be highly variable across
   levels of biological organisation (e.g., species, populations, among
   individuals, within individuals). Some of the variation in SMR can be
   attributed to factors such as diet, temperature, and body mass, yet much
   of the residual variation in SMR remains unexplained. Intuitively, we
   can expect SMR to co-vary with ``personality{''}, but the rapidly
   accumulating empirical evidence on this topic remains equivocal. The
   goal of this study was to test for a link between SMR and a behavioural
   syndrome at the among-individual level in wild-caught fall field
   crickets (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). Paired measurements of SMR and two
   behavioural traits were repeatedly taken over a two-month period, thus
   allowing to estimate the among-individual correlations (rind) separately
   from the residual (within-individual) correlations. The two behavioural
   traits (latency to exit a refuge in a novel environment and
   ``freezing{''} time following a stressful stimulus) were significantly
   and moderately repeatable and were found to be part of a syndrome, as
   indicated by a strong and positive among-individual correlation (r(ind)
   = 0.82 0.27). Yet, only latency to exit was significantly and positively
   correlated with SMR (r(ind) = 0.45 0.21), suggesting that the link
   between boldness and SMR may be driven by individual differences in
   responses to novelty and not to simulated predatory cues. Since we found
   that bold individuals (short latency to exit) consistently had a lower
   SMR than shy individuals (long latency to exit), our results go against
   the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. Instead, our results suggest the
   presence of constrains in the energy budgets of crickets, which
   generated an allocation trade-off between energy spent on physical
   activity vs. maintenance costs (SMR).}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes refer to correlated suites of behavioural traits
   exhibiting consistent among-individual variation, i.e. personality.
   Factor analysis (FA) is currently the dominant method for modelling
   behavioural syndromes in humans and animals. Although FA is useful for
   inferring the latent causes underlying trait correlations, it does not
   account for the pairwise behavioural interactions that also contribute
   to syndrome structure. Given that latent factors and pairwise
   interactions are likely ubiquitous causes of trait covariation, both
   should be modelled simultaneously. Currently, however, behavioural
   ecologists lack an integrative framework for describing and inferring
   such behavioural syndromes. Generalized network modelling (GNM),
   representing an integration of FA and Gaussian graphical modelling
   (GGM), meets this challenge. We provide a theoretical introduction to
   GNM as well as a method for detecting latent factors in GGMs called
   exploratory graph analysis (EGA). We then propose the novel EGA+GNM
   framework for modelling multiple sources of trait correlations and
   ensuring more robust causal inferences. To empirically demonstrate the
   utility of this framework, we compare models derived from EGA+GNM and FA
   using observational measures of social and arousal behaviour in common
   marmosets Callithrix jacchus. Using information-theoretic model
   comparison, we find support for EGA+GNM models compared to models
   generated by FA. Two EGA+GNM models suggest that while latent factors
   contribute to the emergence of clustered sociability and arousal
   behaviours, correlations among these traits may also be partially
   explained by pairwise interactions. Additionally, these behavioural
   clusters are hypothesized to be causally linked by a positive pairwise
   interaction between allogrooming and activity level. These results

Abstract = {{Animal individuals show patterns of behavior that are stable within
   individuals but different among individuals. Such individual differences
   are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and
   in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in
   specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent
   across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field
   investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying
   nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context.
   We further investigated how individual differences affect choice
   performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized
   behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually
   identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar
   of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral
   measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the
   two-month observation period. We investigated the link between
   individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using
   generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice
   performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that
   bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid
   unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed
   model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare
   hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of
   between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our
   study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This
   may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual
   behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models
   of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like
   other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of
   consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We
   characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild,
   free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from
   computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest.
   Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different
   ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For
   example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others
   tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before
   returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also
   consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with
   dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few
   visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging
   strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in cognition have been shown to be common in some
   animal taxa, and recent evidence suggests that an individual's
   personality can be associated with an individual's cognitive strategy.
   We tested whether wild bat-eared foxes Otocyon megalotis differ in a
   risk-taking behavior (tameness) and whether this trait correlated with
   appetitive association learning performance. While our result shows that
   individuals differed in their tameness, we found no association between
   this personality trait and learning the appetitive association. This
   result does not support the framework that differences in cognition are
   associated with differences in personality; however, our small sample
   size does not allow us to assert that personality cannot be associated
   with cognition in this system. This study highlights that measuring
   cognition and personality in wild systems presents added difficulty and
   that correlations found in captive animals may not be evident in their

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding causes and consequences of behavioural plasticity is a
   major focus in animal behaviour studies for its importance to any
   population's ability to persist under changing environments. However,
   behavioural plasticity in traits linked to reproduction has received
   surprisingly limited attention, especially in species exhibiting
   alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). In this study, we explored how
   behavioural plasticity in ARTs varies in response to social conditions
   in male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, an internally fertilizing fish in
   which males can switch between two ARTs to achieve matings. Males can
   either court receptive females using elaborate mating displays
   (courtship), or attempt forced copulations without prior display or
   female cooperation (sneaking). Although males have a genetic
   predisposition to engage predominantly in one tactic over the other, the
   extent to which social experience shapes individual plasticity in these
   tactics is unknown. We observed that between-individual variation in
   mating effort and preferred ARTs was repeatable over time and largely
   explained by variation in body size and coloration between individuals.
   Moreover, we showed experimentally that males exposed to social cues
   rapidly developed a preference towards either sneaking or courting,
   resulting in a rapid decline in individual plasticity compared to their
   socially deprived counterparts. These findings accord with the
   theoretical predictions that behavioural plasticity should decline as
   individuals incrementally adjust to local environmental conditions and,
   thus, when environmental uncertainty is reduced. (C) 2018 The

Title = {{Exploring determinants of behavioral chronotype in a diurnal-rodent
   model of human physiology}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{146-153}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies conducted with human participants have shown that
   differences in chronotype, defined as individual patterns of early or
   late beginning of daily activity, have implications for many
   biobehavioral processes, such as cognitive performance, mood,
   impulsivity, academic achievement of college students, and mental
   health. However, the determinants of individual variation in chronotype
   have not been investigated. Basic research on circadian rhythms has
   provided a basis for investigating the causes of chronotype variation,
   but experimental tests of pertinent hypotheses are difficult to conduct
   with human subjects. This limitation can be overcome by use of animal
   models. This study was conducted with a rodent species, the antelope
   ground squirrel (Ammospermophilus leucurus), that, like humans, is
   active during the daytime, exhibits a spread of chronotypes, and has a
   similar average free-running circadian period. We found chronotype to be
   a stable trait within individuals based on strong consistency of
   separate determinations made six months apart (correlation r = 0.91). We
   also found a moderate correlation of chronotype with the duration of the
   active phase (r = 0.51) and with free running period (r = 0.34), but
   weak correlation with rhythm robustness (r = 0.16), and no correlation
   with photic responsiveness or with masking responses. The best multiple
   regression model, incorporating the duration of the active phase,
   free-running period, and rhythm robustness, explained 38\% of the
   variance in chronotype. Although 62\% of the variance in chronotype
   remained unaccounted for, the results are encouraging because they
   document the possibility of using a diurnal rodent as a model for the
   investigation of the determinants of chronotype variation in humans.}},

   influence behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that among-individual differences in
   behaviour are, in part, generated by environmental effects. For example,
   diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural
   variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e.
   as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait
   expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of
   variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a
   trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other
   traits, remains unclear. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design crossing life
   stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy
   content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on
   the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for
   their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither
   developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means
   or on the expression of an activity-antipredator response syndrome,
   suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for
   increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a
   high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for
   antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with
   higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural
   plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in
   within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during
   development also mediated the links between maturation time and
   exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when
   exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was
   absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes
   in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life
   history and behavioural traits later in life. (C) 2018 The Association

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The metabolism and behaviour of crustaceans are highly flexible, and the
   inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and
   ecologically significant. We analysed the relationships among
   personality traits (boldness, activity and hesitancy), agonistic
   behaviour and energy status (glycogen. glucose and lactate) in the
   swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus. The main results were as
   follows. (1) Boldness was significantly correlated with activity and
   hesitancy. Bold crabs were more likely to initiate and win a fight. In
   bold individuals, the frequencies of `move to', `cheliped display',
   `grasp' and `contact' were significantly higher than those of shy
   individuals, whereas the frequency of `move away' was significantly
   lower than that of shy individuals. (2) Before fighting, the glucose
   concentrations in the haemolymph of bold individuals were significantly
   lower than those of shy individuals, whereas the concentrations of
   lactate showed the opposite trend. There were no significant differences
   in glycogen and lactate concentrations in the claw muscle between bold
   and shy individuals. (3) After fighting. the glucose and lactate
   concentrations in the haemolymph of both bold and shy individuals were
   significantly higher than those before fighting. The glucose
   concentrations in the haemolymph were significantly higher in bold
   individuals than shy individuals. In addition, bold individuals showed a
   larger increase in glucose in the haemolymph but a smaller increase in
   lactate compared with shy individuals. (4) After fighting, the glycogen
   concentrations in the claw muscle were significantly lower than those
   before fighting; however, there were no significant differences in the
   concentrations of lactate in the claw muscle. These results indicated
   that the agonistic behaviour of the swimming crab is related to its
   behavioural type. Energy reserves may be one of the factors affecting
   the personality traits and agonistic behaviour in crabs. These results
   should lay a foundation for in-depth understanding of the relationships
   among crustacean personality, agonistic behaviour and metabolic
   physiology.}},

Abstract = {{Organismal responses to stressors can be influenced by several internal
   and external factors including physiological condition and inherent
   behavioral type. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a known stressor for fish, is
   naturally increasing in fresh water, and has been proposed as a
   non-physical barrier to prevent invasive fish movement. Intraspecific
   differences in how fish respond to CO2 challenges have been noted, with
   some individuals responding at low partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)),
   and others responding at higher pCO(2). Sensitivity to pCO(2) may play a
   role in avoidance behaviors with respect to CO2 barriers and may predict
   how fish respond to naturally occurring CO2 challenges. We sought to
   determine the role that both physiological condition (i.e., elevated
   cortisol) and personality (i.e., boldness) play in influencing
   behavioral responses. To accomplish this goal, a shuttle box assay was
   used to determine the pCO(2) that elicited avoidance in
   cortisol-injected or non-injected largemouth bass (Micropterus
   salmoides), as well as bold or shy bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus).
   Cortisol-injected largemouth bass shuttled at 45\% higher pCO(2) than
   control fish, but personality of bluegill had no effect on shuttling. It
   appears that an individual's cortisol level can affect CO2 avoidance,
   likely mediated through the effects of cortisol on acid-base balance at
   the gill, or through the effects of cortisol on coping styles. Our
   finding has important implications for how fish respond to either
   natural or anthropogenically-driven changes in CO2, as stressed fish
   with high cortisol would appear to be more tolerant of elevated CO2,
   independent of personality type.}},

Abstract = {{As is the case for humans, it has long been thought that nonhuman
   primates can be described in terms of their personality. Scientific
   observations that support this view include the presence of individual
   differences in social behavior and that they are relatively stable
   throughout life. Consequently, individuals are constrained in their
   behavioral flexibility when dealing with various environmental
   challenges. Still, the variation among individuals during development
   suggests that the environment influences how primates behave. Research
   in fields including psychology, behavior genetics, and behavioral
   ecology have tried to identify the mechanisms responsible for this
   interplay of behavioral stability and change. In this review, we
   integrate theories and findings from research on humans and nonhuman
   primates that highlight how and to what extent genetic and environmental
   contributions shape the development of social behavior. To do so, we
   first provide an overview and define what is meant by mean-level and
   rank-order change of behavior. We then review explanations of behavioral
   stability and change, focusing on the role of genetic effects, how
   environmental circumstances influence behavioral variation throughout
   development, and how genetic and environmental influences may interact
   to produce this variation. Finally, we point to future research
   directions that could help us to further understand the development of
   social behavior in primates from within a behavior genetics framework.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The habituation of wildlife to humans is a growing global problem that
   damages ecological integrity and threatens public safety, but the
   behavioural processes underlying habituation have rarely been explicitly
   tested in large animals. These processes are also likely influenced by
   animal personality. I used three personality traits to delineate a
   gradient of shy to bold personality types in captive elk (Cervus
   canadensis). I then attempted to habituate elk using either food
   attractants paired with inactive human presence, or with human
   approaches but no food attractants. Both food and approach treatments
   significantly reduced elk wariness, as measured by mean flight response
   distances, while elk in a control pen showed no change. During approach
   treatments bolder elk showed significantly larger reductions in wariness
   than shyer elk, but personality had no influence on wariness reductions
   after food conditioning. My results demonstrate that habituation can be
   proactive, whereby animals overcome wariness as a way to reap rewards,
   but can also be reactive, whereby animals can be forced to habituate
   through the repeated exposure to negative stimuli to which wariness
   responses are energetically costly. I showed that changes in optimality
   decisions surrounding risk and reward are influenced by the
   personalities of individual animals.}},

Title = {{Don't poke the bear: using tracking data to quantify behavioural
   syndromes in elusive wildlife}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{91-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality traits and the emergence of behavioural syndromes,
   i.e. between-individual correlation of behaviours, are commonly
   quantified from behavioural observations in controlled environments.
   Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is,
   however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit
   alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between
   individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data
   can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified
   six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46
   adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer
   and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for
   activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we
   quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of
   encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness:
   diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat
   types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether
   behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal
   personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between
   individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of
   behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual
   variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed
   model revealed significant positive correlations between travel
   distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an
   activity-exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our
   bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were
   uncorrelated with the activity-exploration syndrome and with each other,
   albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that
   readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be
   used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours.
   We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking
   data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal
   personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and
   human-wildlife coexistence. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{222}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Parasites alter their host behaviour and vice versa as a result of
   mutual adaptations in the evolutionary arms race. One of these
   adaptations involves changes in host thermoregulation, which has the
   potential to harm the parasite and thereby act as a defence mechanism.
   We used a model of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) experimentally
   parasitised with glochidia ectoparasitic larvae from the endangered
   freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) to reveal whether
   parasitisation alters fish behavioural thermoregulation. A study using
   radiotelemetry temperature sensors was performed during almost one year
   of the M. margaritifera parasitic stage. Glochidia-infested S. trutta
   altered their thermoregulation through active searching for habitats
   with different thermal regimes. The general preference for temperatures
   in infested fish varied and was either above or below the temperature
   preferred by uninfested individuals. Infested fish also preferred
   different temperatures across localities, whereas uninfested fish
   maintained their thermal preference no matter which stream they
   inhabited. Glochidia further induced the expression of a behavioural
   syndrome among S. trutta personality traits, suggesting that it might
   increase the probability that the fish host would occur in the glochidia
   temperature optimum. Our findings present the first evidence that
   thermoregulation plays a fundamental role in the relationship of
   affiliated mussels and their fish hosts. Incorporating thermoregulation
   as a factor in the study of this relationship can help to interpret
   results from previous behavioural studies, as well as to optimise
   management measures related to endangered mussels.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{114-124}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dispersers should express different foraging or social behaviors than
   nondispersers to thrive in unfamiliar habitats. In pied flycatchers
   (Ficedula hypoleuca), naive dispersers (immigrants) had a more
   generalist diet and higher feeding rates compared with philopatric
   birds, but we found no difference in level of aggression. Males with
   more generalist diet fledged more young. This suggests that learning or
   early imprinting affects individual food and settlement choices and that
   dispersers adopt different life-history strategies.
   Abstract Dispersal is an essential process for most animal populations
   to persist in changing environments. Dispersers are often a nonrandom
   sample of the population, and differ consistently from nondispersers in
   a suite of correlated phenotypic traits (dispersal syndromes). This
   phenotypic integration is thought to be adaptive. Here, we investigate
   whether dispersal tendency of individual pied flycatchers (Ficedula
   hypoleuca) covaries with a set of repeatable behaviors that should
   confer advantages for surviving and reproducing in novel environments.
   We specifically focus on the link between dispersal, foraging behavior,
   and aggressiveness because selection on foraging tactics or social
   behaviors likely differs between individuals staying in familiar or
   dispersing to novel environments. Using repeated measures of nestling
   provisioning data of pied flycatcher parents in 1 year, we tested if
   immigrants and philopatric individuals (local recruits and experienced
   breeders) differed in diet specialization, provisioning rates, levels of
   aggression, and reproductive success. Results show that individuals
   differed consistently in their foraging behavior, with immigrants having
   a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates than philopatric birds,
   but not in aggressiveness. More generalist males fledged more young. Our
   findings suggest that prior local knowledge facilitates diet
   specialization, and that more generalist diets could be adaptive for
   immigrants breeding in unknown environments. Aggressiveness was not part
   of the dispersal syndrome in our population, perhaps because high
   aggression levels are too costly to maintain in high density
   populations. Understanding the proximate causes and ultimate
   consequences of variation in dispersal syndromes requires now
   experimental manipulations of individual dispersal decisions.}},

Title = {{A review of urban wildlife management from the animal personality
   perspective: The case of urban deer}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife living around urbanized areas is often a cause of crucial
   issues such as zoonosis and wildlife-vehicle collisions. Despite this,
   residents hold positive views on the presence of urban wildlife
   primarily due to aesthetic reasons. This accepting attitude towards our
   coexistence with urban wildlife has made it difficult for wildlife
   managers to come to a consensus concerning the importance of human-urban
   wildlife conflicts. Although countermeasures such as lethal force and/or
   fencing are commonly used to control human-wildlife conflicts, these
   approaches are rarely applied in the case of urban wildlife. It is
   essential to recognize the gap between the current state of urban
   wildlife management and advanced scientific knowledge of urban wildlife
   behavior in order to mitigate urban deer conflicts. Fortunately,
   behavioral ecologists have been attempting to apply the perspective of
   individual differences, such as animal personality, to wildlife
   management. Studies have shown how the personalities of wildlife
   contribute to their adaptation to urban habitats. In order to prevent
   human-urban wildlife conflicts, recognizing the personalities of
   wildlife and selective culling of bold individuals should be conducted
   for deliberate selection for shyness when developing wildlife management
   plans. Making wildlife shy away from humans is essential to urban
   wildlife management. The aim of this study is to review observed
   measures against human-urban wildlife conflicts in Japan and to propose
   a new direction for innovative and effective approaches that takes
   animals personality into account to mitigate urban-wildlife conflicts.
   For this review we will target deer as a model species because deer are
   among the most serious of problem-causing urban wildlife. (C) 2018

Title = {{Density-dependent changes in neophobia and stress-coping styles in the
   world's oldest farmed fish}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Farmed fish are typically reared at densities much higher than those
   observed in the wild, but to what extent crowding results in abnormal
   behaviours that can impact welfare and stress coping styles is subject
   to debate. Neophobia (i.e. fear of the `new') is thought to be adaptive
   under natural conditions by limiting risks, but it is potentially
   maladapted in captivity, where there are no predators or novel foods. We
   reared juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochmrnis niloticus) for six weeks at
   either high (50 g l(-1)) or low density (14 g l(-1)), assessed the
   extent of skin and eye darkening (two proxies of chronic stress), and
   exposed them to a novel object in an open test arena, with and without
   cover, to assess the effects of density on neophobia and stress coping
   styles. Fish reared at high density were darker, more neophobic, less
   aggressive, less mobile and less likely to take risks than those reared
   at low density, and these effects were exacerbated when no cover was
   available. Thus, the reactive coping style shown by fish at high density
   was very different from the proactive coping style shown by fish at low
   density. Our findings provide novel insights into the plasticity of fish
   behaviour and the effects of aquaculture intensification on one of the
   world's oldest farmed and most invasive fish, and highlight the
   importance of considering context. Crowding could have a positive effect
   on the welfare of tilapia by reducing aggressive behaviour, but it can
   also make fish chronically stressed and more fearful, which could make
   them less invasive.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{Individual responses, particularly based on personality, can have
   important consequences for individual fitness, based upon success in
   exploring new habitats, feeding on novel foods, and aggressiveness in
   competitive interactions. We conducted laboratory experiments to analyze
   individual responses to different artificial conditions that could suit
   specific male and female personalities in the endangered seahorse,
   Hippocampus reidi. Our experiments with H. reidi evaluated individual
   responses to a new habitat, novel objects, level of inactivity and
   social interactions. We demonstrate that approximately half of the
   seahorses have a bold personality, readily inspecting new habitats and
   objects and sporadically presenting social approaches. The remaining shy
   individuals had high levels of inactivity and did not check novelties in
   their habitats. Although we expected that males would have shyer
   personalities when compared with females, due to their ecological role
   in the provision of parental care, we found no statistical difference
   between the sexes in terms of these aspects of personality. The similar
   frequency of both types of personality in males and females suggests
   that these features may be balanced and evolutionarily stable in the
   sampled population.}},

Title = {{Behavioral syndrome persists over metamorphosis in a pond-breeding
   amphibian}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, behavioral ecology has shifted from assuming animal
   behavior is infinitely plastic and situation specific to recognizing
   that behavior can be limited in its plasticity and correlated across
   different ecological situations. At the center of this new framework are
   behavioral syndromes or consistent individual differences in behavioral
   tendencies. Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified the
   evolutionary mechanisms and ecological implications of behavioral
   syndromes. However, the persistence of behavioral syndromes over
   ontogeny remains an open question. Species with complex life cycles
   present an interesting system in which to test the persistence of
   behavioral syndromes, because such life histories are thought to evolve
   when correlations between life stages are costly. In this study, we
   tested the hypothesis that behavioral tendencies of species with complex
   life histories are consistent within a life stage (before or after
   metamorphosis) but not between life stages. We experimentally assayed
   the activity, boldness, and exploration of spotted salamanders
   (Ambystoma maculatum) before and after metamorphosis. We found most
   behaviors to be at least moderately repeatable. Additionally, there was
   support for a behavioral syndrome within the larval stage as well as
   between larval behaviors and juvenile boldness. Our results reject the
   adaptive decoupling hypothesis and instead suggest that behavioral
   syndromes in species with complex life cycles can be maintained over
   metamorphosis.Significance statementA central prediction of behavioral
   syndromes is that individual behavioral consistency should be maintained
   over the life of an organism. However, in species with complex life
   cycles, evolution is thought to act independently on each stage, leading
   to the prediction that behavioral syndromes should not persist over
   metamorphosis. We tested for behavioral correlations over metamorphosis
   by assaying salamander activity, boldness, and exploration in larval and
   juvenile salamanders. We found support for behavioral syndromes within
   and between life stages. These findings contradict the predictions of
   complex life cycle evolution and instead suggest that behavioral
   syndromes may span metamorphosis. However, because support for the
   persistence of syndromes over metamorphosis varies between taxa, we
   caution researchers against extrapolating inferences from the larval
   stage to the juvenile stage.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in behaviour has been shown to have important
   ecological and evolutionary consequences. Research on animal personality
   has therefore received considerable attention, yet some methodological
   issues remain unresolved. We tested whether assessing personality by
   coding common behaviours is as time-consuming method as some researchers
   believe it to be. Altogether, 300 hours of observation were collected on
   20 captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). We first examined the
   repeatability of behavioural indices that represented the behavioural
   repertoire of cotton-top tamarins. We then compared the personality
   structures, based on different lengths of observation time, of these
   behavioural indices. The minimum observational time necessary to obtain
   a stable personality structure was 5 to 7 hours per individual. This
   stable structure included two components: Extraversion and Confidence,
   which were similar to those described in great apes, Old World monkeys,
   and other New World monkeys. Our findings suggest that, at least in the
   case of cotton-top tamarins, behavioural coding over relatively short
   periods of time can be used to assess personality and that longer
   observation periods may yield diminishing returns.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY OPEN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Personality variation has been proven to affect ecology, evolution and
   group behaviour in many ways. Nevertheless, how social context
   influences behavioural strategies and individual personality variation
   has rarely been addressed. This study sheds light on the relationship
   between social interactions, personality variation and plasticity in a
   collective context. For this purpose, we used a binary setup (i.e. an
   arena with two identical shelters) to study the aggregation process of
   cockroaches. We tested the same individuals in isolated and social
   (groups of 16 individuals) conditions. We show that even if social
   interactions reduce the observation of personality variation, the
   behaviour in a group is correlated to individual preferences displayed
   in isolation. Furthermore, our results suggest that individuals show
   different levels of plasticity according to their shelter occupancy;
   individuals with high occupancy rates show low levels of plasticity and
   are less affected by social amplification in social conditions.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{532-539}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Individuals are known to differ consistently in various aspects of their
   behaviour in many animal species, a phenomenon that has come to be
   referred to as animal personalities. These individual differences are
   likely to have evolutionary and ecological significance, and it is
   therefore important to understand the precise nature of how
   environmental and physiological factors affect animal personalities. One
   factor which may affect personality is disease, but while the effects of
   disease on many aspects of host behaviour are well known, the effects on
   animal personalities have been little studied. Here we show that wood
   ants, Formica rufa, exhibit consistent individual differences in three
   personality traits: boldness, sociability and aggressiveness. However,
   experimental exposure to a virulent fungal parasite, Metarhizium
   pingshaense, had surprisingly little effect on the personality traits.
   Parasite-challenged ants showed marginal changes in sociability at high
   doses of parasite but no change in boldness or aggressiveness even when
   close to death. There was similarly little effect of other physiological
   stresses on ant personalities. The results suggest that individual
   personality in ants can be remarkably resilient to physiological stress,
   such as that caused by parasite infection. Future studies are needed to
   determine whether there is a similar resilience in solitary animals, as
   well as in other social species.}},

Title = {{Description of a personality syndrome in a common and invasive ground
   beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae)}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent differences among individuals
   in their behaviour, is being increasingly studied as it might lead to a
   new understanding of the evolution of behaviours. Despite a clear
   interest in studying personality in a wide range of taxa for comparative
   analyses, studies on invertebrates are still scarce. Here, we
   investigated the personality of a ground beetle, Nebria brevicollis,
   which is widespread in Europe and invasive in North America. We measured
   seven behavioural traits from an array of three different tests: (i)
   activity and exploration related traits; (ii) reaction to a threat, and
   (iii) phototaxis. The repeatability was tested by measuring all
   behaviours twice, on different days. All behavioural traits were
   consistent through time, highlighting the presence of personality in the
   beetle. In addition, we analysed the relationship between the different
   traits and highlighted two clusters of behaviours (behavioural
   syndrome), one grouping activity, exploration and boldness traits, and a
   second one consisting of responses to a threat. This study is the first
   to our knowledge to provide evidence for personality dimensions within
   the vast group of the Carabidae. It also constitutes a preliminary step
   in the experimental investigation of the importance of animal
   personality in invasive species.}},

Title = {{Experimental manipulation of monoamine levels alters personality in
   crickets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality has been described in a range of species with
   ecological and evolutionary consequences. Factors shaping and
   maintaining variation in personality are not fully understood, but
   monoaminergic systems are consistently linked to personality variation.
   We experimentally explored how personality was influenced by alterations
   in two key monoamine systems: dopamine and serotonin. This was done
   using ropinirole and fluoxetine, two common human pharmaceuticals. Using
   the Mediterranean field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus), we focused on the
   personality traits activity, exploration, and aggression, with confirmed
   repeatability in our study. Dopamine manipulations explained little
   variation in the personality traits investigated, while serotonin
   manipulation reduced both activity and aggression. Due to limited
   previous research, we created a dose-response curve for ropinirole,
   ranging from concentrations measured in surface waters to human
   therapeutic doses. No ropinirole dose level strongly influenced cricket
   personality, suggesting our results did not come from a dose mismatch.
   Our results indicate that the serotonergic system explains more
   variation in personality than manipulations of the dopaminergic system.
   Additionally, they suggest that monoamine systems differ across taxa,
   and confirm the importance of the mode of action of pharmaceuticals in
   determining their effects on behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent among-individual differences in behavior have been described
   in numerous taxa. More recently, the hypothesis that such behavioral
   variation may also correlate to life-history traits, such as investment
   in current or future reproduction, has been proposed as a potential
   explanation for why variation is maintained among and within
   populations. A continual challenge in measuring the integration of these
   traits, or the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS), is to find a reliable and
   quantifiable proxy for energy allocation between reproduction and
   self-maintenance. Here, I address this challenge using the eusocial
   insects, Temnothorax ants, in a common garden experiment to directly
   quantify energy allocation by tracking the number of sterile workers
   (somatic effort) and winged reproductive ants (reproductive effort)
   produced across years. I use colonies collected from populations
   previously demonstrated to show significant differences in a
   risk-tolerance behavioral syndrome. I provide an empirical test of the
   POLS hypothesis between 2 populations of Temnothorax ants over three
   years. I find strong evidence for a POLS between populations and weaker,
   but present support for a within population POLS. More risk-tolerant
   populations also allocate more energy towards reproduction and grow
   faster across years. This study then emphasizes the value of a more
   holistic study of among-individual variation. Additionally, it suggests
   more research is needed on understanding how and why traits may
   correlate in some populations, but remain independent in others.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific individuals often consistently differ in their behavioral
   responses to specific exogenous stimuli. Such individual differences in
   ``personality{''} have been shown to be heritable, suggesting that
   selection maintains variation in personality. However, survival
   selection on a major personality trait, antipredator behavior, and its
   sex-dependency, has been seldom measured in the wild. Here, we found
   that yearling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) showed consistency in
   agitation upon repeated exposure to a restraint-handling protocol,
   probably reflecting antipredator behavior, and that males were more
   agitated than females. Females that exhibited larger antipredator
   behavior were more likely to survive until the next breeding season with
   no variation among 3 study years nor across 7 breeding colonies,
   suggesting that variation in antipredator behavior is not maintained by
   spatiotemporal variation in viability selection on antipredator
   behavior. In both sexes, the intensity of melanin-based ventral plumage
   coloration positively covaried with antipredator behavior, consistent
   with previous observations from diverse vertebrate species. In some barn
   swallow populations, male coloration is targeted by directional
   intersexual selection, suggesting that melanization signals antipredator
   behavior to prospecting females and that sexual selection for
   antipredator behavior, or other correlated personality traits, can drive
   the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in barn swallows. Thus, we
   showed that viability selection occurs on antipredator behavior and that
   spatiotemporal variation in selection has no major role in promoting
   variation in antipredator behavior. More melanized individuals were more
   agitated, implying that melanization may signal personality in a sexual
   communication context in a species where male coloration is an epigamic
   trait.}},

   sticklebacks are more social}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The existence of animal personality is now well-documented, although the
   causes and consequences of this phenomenon are still largely unclear.
   Parasite infection can have pervasive effects on hosts, including
   altering host behaviour, and may thus contribute to differences in host
   personality. We investigated the relationship between the three-spined
   stickleback and its common parasite Glugea anomala, with focus on
   differences in host personality. Naturally infected and uninfected
   individuals were assayed for the five personality traits activity,
   exploration, boldness, sociability, and aggression. If infected fish
   behaved differently from uninfected, to benefit this parasite with
   horizontal transmission, we predicted behaviour increasing interactions
   with other sticklebacks to increase. Infection status explained
   differences in host personality. Specifically, Glugea-infected
   individuals were more social than uninfected fish. This confirms a link
   between parasite infection and host behaviour, and a relationship which
   may improve the horizontal transmission of Glugea. However, future
   studies need to establish the consequences of this for the parasite, and
   the causality of the parasite-host personality relationship.
   Significance statement
   Parasite infection that alters host behaviour could be a possible avenue
   of research into the causes of animal personality. We studied the link
   between infection and personality using the three-spined stickleback and
   its parasite Glugea anomala. We predicted that infected individuals
   would be more prone to interact with other sticklebacks, since this
   would improve transmission of this parasite. The personality of
   uninfected and naturally infected fish was measured and we observed that
   Glugea-infected sticklebacks were more social. Our results confirm a
   link between parasitism and variation in host personality.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic theory of ecology predicts resource consumption rates of
   animals from their body mass, but other phenotypic traits might affect
   individual resource consumption rate. In this paper, we used a
   hierarchical framework to examine relationships between phenotypic
   traits thought to constrain variation in per capita resource consumption
   rate. Physiological and behavioural traits were assumed to be important
   in mediating the control of morphology and sex on consumption. We
   conducted a longitudinal study aiming to relate the consumption rate of
   submerged leaf litter to sex, morphological, physiological and
   behavioural traits in an aquatic detritivore population. Then, we
   analysed the pattern of trait covariation using structural equation
   modelling (SEM). We observed broad and repeatable inter-individual
   variation in leaf consumption rate and other phenotypic traits. We found
   that expressing litter consumption rate relative to the time individuals
   spent feeding revealed and increased the effect of body mass and sex
   differences, respectively. Accordingly, SEM analyses showed that time
   allocated to resource acquisition mediated body mass and sex effects on
   apparent litter consumption rate whose variation was also accounted for
   by an indicator of activity-specific metabolic rate. Substantial
   variation in resource consumption rate was due to sex difference whereas
   body mass was of secondary importance. Individual phenotypic trait
   variations strongly altered consumer-resource relationships. Therefore,
   we encourage studies on consumers' intraspecific variability to advance
   knowledge about phenotypic determinants of individual resource
   consumption, an important link between individuals and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of animal personality have shown consistent between-individual
   variation in behaviour in many social and non-social contexts, but
   hunting behaviour has been overlooked. Prey capture sequences,
   especially in invertebrates, are supposed to be quite invariant. In
   cuttlefish, the attack includes three components: attention,
   positioning, and seizure. The previous studies indicated some
   variability in these components and we quantified it under the
   hypothesis that it could relate to personality differences. We,
   therefore, analysed predation sequences of adult cuttlefish to test
   their association with personality traits in different contexts.
   Nineteen subjects were first exposed to an ``alert{''} and a
   ``threat{''} test and then given a live prey, for 10 days. Predation
   sequences were scored for components of the attack, locomotor and
   postural elements, body patterns, and number of successful tentacle
   ejections (i.e. seizure). PCA analysis of predatory patterns identified
   three dimensions accounting for 53.1\%, 15.9\%, and 9.6\% of the
   variance and discriminating individuals based on ``speed in catching
   prey{''}, ``duration of attack behaviour{''}, and ``attention to
   prey{''}. Predation rate, success rate, and hunting time were
   significantly correlated with the first, second, and third PCA factors,
   respectively. Significant correlations between capture patterns and
   responsiveness in the alert and threat tests were found, highlighting a
   consistency of prey capture patterns with measures of personality in
   other contexts. Personality may permeate even those behaviour patterns
   that appear relatively invariant.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on animal personalities has shown that individuals within
   populations often differ consistently in various types of behaviour and
   that many of these behaviours correlate among individuals to form
   behavioural syndromes. Individuals of certain species have also been
   shown to differ in their rate of behavioural innovation in arriving at
   novel solutions to new and existing problems (e.g., mazes, novel foods).
   Here, we investigate whether behaviours traditionally studied in
   personality research are correlated with individual rates of innovation
   as part of a wider behavioural syndrome. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
   of both sexes from three different wild population sources were
   assessed: (a) exploration of an open area; (b) speed through a
   three-dimensional maze; (c) investigation of a novel object; and (d)
   attraction to a novel food. The covariance structure (syndrome
   structure) was examined using structural equation modelling. The best
   model separated behaviours relating to activity in all contexts from
   rates of exploration/investigation and innovation. Innovative behaviour
   (utilizing new food and moving through a novel area) in these fish
   therefore forms part of the same syndrome as the traditional shy-bold
   continuum (exploration of an open area and investigation of a novel
   object) found in many animal personality studies. There were no clear
   differences in innovation or syndrome structure between the sexes, or
   between the three different populations. However, body size was
   implicated as part of the behavioural syndrome structure, and because
   body size is highly correlated with age in guppies, this suggests that
   individual behavioural differences in personality/innovation in guppies
   may largely be driven by developmental state.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in
   behavioural profiles correlate to differences in stress-related
   behaviours and hormonal levels in captive brown capuchin monkeys
   (Sapajus libidinosus). Based on a sample of 25 animals, 143 h of
   behavioural data collection and 518 faecal samples, principal component
   analyses indicated the existence of four components that characterize
   the individuals' Genus Normative Behaviour (GNB) (KMO = 0.531, X-2 =
   127.672, p < 0.001): `Feeding', `Sociability', `Exploration', and
   `Activity'. Other four components are related to stress coping styles
   (based on Behaviour Potentially Indicative of Stress - BPIS) (KMO =
   0.550, X-2 = 329.303, p < 0.001): `Self-directed'; `Restless',
   `Ingestion/Self-Scratching', and `Stereotyped'. More active individuals
   exhibit rapid stress-related behaviours (r = 0.443; p = 0.044) while
   less active individuals exhibit more stationary stress-related
   behaviours (r = -0.519; p = 0.013). Akaike information criteria
   indicated that the best linear regression model to predict the
   physiological profile (Faecal Glucocorticoid Metabolites - FGM) included
   three GNB and three BPIS components. `Sociability' (p < 0.05),
   `Exploration' (p < 0.05), and `Ingestion/Self-scratching' (p < 0.05)
   predicted lower FGM levels. `Activity' (p < 0.05), `Self-directed' (p <
   0.05), and `Stereotyped' (p < 0.05) predicted higher FGM levels.
   `Feeding' and `Restless' factors were not included in the models. Our
   results support previous studies indicating that animals within the same
   population differ in the way they behave and react to stressful
   conditions, and these are correlated to different physiological
   profiles. Mapping inter-individual differences in stress coping
   strategies may help clarify the long-term reported incongruity between
   behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare in captive animals,
   supporting better management practices and assisting translational
   models of the development of psychopathologies.}},

   traits in adult dairy cattle}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent
   individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important
   factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity.
   However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they
   might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day
   social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term
   temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated
   in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of
   lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a
   novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of
   behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven
   in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter
   reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object
   contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object
   contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s =
   0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to
   investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test
   parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test
   results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition
   changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two
   personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified
   by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between
   the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P =
   0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support
   the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and
   they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group
   situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results
   implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on
   individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group
   behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social
   environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day
   situations.}},

Title = {{Effects of acclimatisation on behavioural repeatability in two behaviour
   assays of the guppy Poecilia reticulata}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Establishing behavioural repeatability is important in animal
   personality research; however, a range of factors can influence
   repeatability. Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is
   important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of
   behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal
   behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between
   observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is
   widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time
   varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated
   the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and
   emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared
   guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous
   findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after
   2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish
   exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability;
   however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting
   that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses
   irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent
   across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact
   the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered
   carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate
   appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to
   commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is
   individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and
   across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural
   differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal
   personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed
   multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent
   differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated
   observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise
   stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a
   range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two
   populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence
   behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity
   levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of
   acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation
   time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be
   properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Exploration and activity are often described as trade-offs between the
   fitness benefits of gathering information and resources, and the
   potential costs of increasing exposure to predators and parasites. More
   exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of
   parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus
   infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse
   Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration,
   activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized
   individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and
   activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these
   traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M.
   natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality
   types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% CI:
   0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of
   age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher
   exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was
   however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these
   2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between
   MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which
   suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to
   MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral
   infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual
   variation in exploration and activity.}},

Abstract = {{Cognition is fundamental to animals' lives and an important source of
   phenotypic variation. Nevertheless, research on individual variation in
   animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual
   cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality
   (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies
   have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality
   traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still
   unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an
   important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing
   young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning
   tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality
   assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed
   was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in
   discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with
   personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated
   with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent
   manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than
   less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for
   adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In
   the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning
   speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results
   suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is
   complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further
   investigation of the causality and dynamics of this
   relationship.Significance statementIn the ancestor of today's chickens,
   the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by
   exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and
   personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning
   speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in
   another (i.e., there were no overall smarter birds). Exploration
   correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal
   learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females,
   learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of
   cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that
   cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can
   differ depending on task and age of the animal.}},

Title = {{Bumblebees Express Consistent, but Flexible, Speed-Accuracy Tactics
   Under Different Levels of Predation Threat}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{A speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) in behavioural decisions is known to
   occur in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Accurate
   decisions often take longer for a given condition, while fast decisions
   can be inaccurate in some tasks. Speed-accuracy tactics are known to
   vary consistently among individuals, and show a degree of flexibility
   during colour discrimination tasks in bees. Such individual flexibility
   in speed-accuracy tactics is likely to be advantageous for animals
   exposed to fluctuating environments, such as changes in predation
   threat. We therefore test whether individual speed-accuracy tactics are
   fixed or flexible under different levels of predation threat in a model
   invertebrate, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. The flexibility of
   speed-accuracy tactics in a foraging context was tested in the
   laboratory using a ``meadow{''} of artificial flowers harbouring
   ``robotic{''} crab spider predators. We found that while the ranking of
   bees along the speed and accuracy continuums was consistent across two
   levels of predation threat, there was some flexibility in the tactics
   used by individual bees - most bees became less accurate at colour
   discrimination when exposed to predation threat when flower types were
   rewarding. The relationship between decision speed and accuracy was
   influenced by predator detectability and the risk associated with making
   incorrect choices during the colour discrimination task. Predator
   crypsis resulted in a breakdown in the relationship between speed and
   accuracy, especially when making an incorrect floral choice incurred a
   distasteful quinine punishment. No single speed-accuracy tactic was
   found to be optimal in terms of foraging efficiency under either
   predation threat situation. However, bees that made faster decisions
   achieved higher nectar collection rates in predator free situations,
   while accurate bees achieved higher foraging rates under predation
   threat. Our findings show that while individual bees remain relatively
   consistent in terms of whether they place greater emphasis on speed or
   accuracy under predation threat, they can respond flexibly to the
   additional time costs of detecting predators.}},

Abstract = {{Individual vigilance against threats typically decreases with group
   size. However, group size often explains a small amount of variation in
   vigilance, suggesting that other factors such as individual differences
   might contribute. For instance, individuals could maintain different
   vigilance levels overall and also respond differently to variation in
   group size. We investigated individual variation in vigilance and its
   patterns of plasticity in flocks of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus
   (Linnaeus, 1758)). We carried out observations at one provisioned site
   and used multiple observations of the same individuals (n = 14) in
   flocks of different sizes over two consecutive months. The typical
   decline in vigilance with flock size occurred at the population level.
   Controlling for food density, flock size, time of year, and sex, we
   documented consistent individual differences in various measurements of
   vigilance. Plasticity of vigilance adjustments to variation in flock
   size occurred for the frequency of high vigilance postures. Male House
   Sparrows with larger bibs, which signal higher dominance status, tended
   to spend less time vigilant and obtained food at a higher rate,
   supporting a state-dependent explanation for the origin of individual
   vigilance profiles. Individual differences can contribute to explaining
   the large scatter in the relationship between vigilance and group size
   in many species.}},

Abstract = {{When they visit and revisit specific areas, animals may reveal what they
   need from their home range and how they acquire information. The
   temporal dimension of such movement recursions, that is, periodicity, is
   however rarely studied, yet potentially bears a species, population or
   individual-specific signature. A recent method allows estimating the
   contribution of periodic patterns to the variance in a movement path. We
   applied it to 709 individuals from five ungulate species, looking for
   species signatures in the form of seasonal variation in the intensity of
   circadian patterns. Circadian patterns were commonplace in the movement
   tracks, but the amount of variance they explained was highly variable
   among individuals. It increased in intensity during spring and summer,
   when key resources were spatially segregated, and decreased during
   winter, when food availability was more uniformly low. Other
   periodicity-inducing mechanisms supported by our comparison of species-
   and sex-specific patterns involve young antipredator behaviour,
   territoriality and behavioural thermoregulation. Model-based
   continuous-time movement metrics represent a new avenue for researchers
   interested in finding individual-, population- or species-specific
   signatures in heterogeneous movement databases featuring various study
   designs and sampling resolutions. However, we observed large amounts of
   individual variation, so comparative analyses should ideally use both
   GPS and animal-borne loggers to augment the discriminatory power and be
   based on large samples. We briefly outline potential uses of the
   intensity of circadian patterns as a metric for the study of animal
   personality and community ecology.}},

Title = {{Unraveling behavioral and pace-of-life syndromes in a reduced parasite
   and predation pressure context: personality and survival of the Barbary
   ground squirrel}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits overlap in behavioral syndromes that are assumed to
   be related to physiology and life history traits, shaping pace-of-life
   syndromes. Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated
   with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less
   efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through
   predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological
   traits using an invasive species-Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura
   island-as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation
   pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and
   escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences
   in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We
   also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed
   behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how
   personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and
   survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences
   in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape
   speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and
   escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to
   parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder
   individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and
   predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the
   typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of
   A. getulus.
   Significance statement
   Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological
   and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients,
   has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the
   eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts
   with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive
   species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow
   testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The
   present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related
   to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and
   survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced
   parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under
   different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground
   squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes
   have higher survival chances than their counterparts.}},

   there was no evidence for a link between them. Our study design included
   several steps to avoid typical pitfalls of disadvantaging shy

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral responses to novel situations often vary and can belong to a
   suite of correlated behaviors. Characteristic behaviors of different
   personality types (e.g. stress coping styles) are generally consistent
   across contexts and time. Here, we compare the repeatability and
   reliability of exploratory behaviors between zebrafish strains
   selectively bred to display contrasting behavioral responses to
   stressors that represent the proactive-reactive axis. Specifically, we
   measure exploratory behavior of individual fish in an open field test
   over five weeks. We quantified the stationary time, average swimming
   speed and time spent by a fish in the center area. We found a number of
   strain differences for each behavioral measure. Stationary time was the
   most repeatable and reliable measure for assessing proactive-reactive
   behavioral differences. Reactive zebrafish generally showed the highest
   reliability and repeatability of exploratory behavior compared to
   proactive zebrafish and a separate wild caught strain. Given the
   increased interest in the evolutionary consequences and proximate
   mechanisms of consistent individual differences, it will be important to
   continue to investigate how different selective pressures may influence
   expression of stress coping styles and their effects on the consistency
   of an animal's behavior.}},

   decreased with crab size at the less disturbed sites, while no
   relationship between size and boldness was found at the disturbed site.
   Boldness increased with habitat disturbance, perhaps because bolder
   crabs succeed in exploiting food around people. Repeatability and
   plasticity were similar across sites. We hypothesize that population
   differences may be the result of developmental plasticity when aquatic
   larvae settle on a beach or selection for boldness at the disturbed site
   acting on each new generation.}},

Title = {{Sociable bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, are selectively captured via

Abstract = {{Individuals often show considerable variance in social behaviour and
   aggression, leading to defined social roles. Removal of individuals with
   particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving
   those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In
   recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk,
   and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social
   structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social
   roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined
   the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To
   address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus,
   a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target
   of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a
   naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish
   was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and
   aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a
   significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status,
   with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a
   transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared
   to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling
   vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance.
   Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more
   likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased
   social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal
   of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of
   social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{95-100}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in
   their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle
   predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result
   of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would
   incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take
   fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of
   this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of
   RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the
   widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of
   female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various
   points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on
   risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after
   a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open
   arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV
   on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater
   levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby
   offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for
   state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {{Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic
   factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food
   availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits.
   Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with
   changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using
   capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red
   squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness
   and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the
   sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under
   different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the
   number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an
   individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of
   presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure
   exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival
   differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better
   than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study
   areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for
   bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated
   with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female
   reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the
   tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types.
   Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor
   food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary
   with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food
   resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red
   squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes.
   Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival
   or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between
   personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels
   under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration
   using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red
   squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food
   availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests
   with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy
   females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower
   body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to
   produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations
   of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in
   relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems.}},

Abstract = {{Individual phenotypic differences are increasingly recognized as key
   drivers of ecological processes. However, studies examining the relative
   importance of these differences in comparison with environmental factors
   or how individual phenotype interacts across different environmental
   contexts remain lacking. We performed two field experiments to assess
   the concurrent roles of personality differences and habitat quality in
   mediating individual mortality and dispersal. We quantified the predator
   avoidance response of mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, collected from low-
   and high-quality oyster reefs and measured crab loss in a caging
   experiment. We simultaneously measured the distance crabs traveled as
   well as the stability of personalities across reef quality in a separate
   reciprocal transplant experiment. Habitat quality was the primary
   determinant of crab loss, although the distance crabs traveled was
   governed by personality which interacted with habitat quality to control
   the fate of crabs. Here, crabs on low-quality reefs rapidly emigrated,
   starting with the boldest individuals, and experienced modest levels of
   predation regardless of personality. In contrast, both bold and shy
   crabs would remain on high-quality reefs for months where bolder
   individuals experienced higher predation risk. These findings suggest
   that personalities could produce vastly different population dynamics
   across habitat quality and govern community responses to habitat
   degradation.}},

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{103}},

Abstract = {{Despite the growing evidence for the importance of developmental
   experiences shaping consistent individual differences in behaviour and
   physiology, the role of endocrine factors underlying the development and
   maintenance of such differences across multiple traits, remains poorly
   understood. Here, we investigated how an experimental manipulation of
   circulating glucocorticoids during early adolescence affects behavioural
   and physiological variation and covariation later in life in the
   precocial cavy (Cavia aperea). Plasma cortisol concentrations were
   experimentally elevated by administering cortisol via food for 3 weeks.
   Struggle docility, escape latency, boldness, exploration and social
   behaviour were then tested three times after individuals attained sexual
   maturity. In addition, blood samples were taken repeatedly to monitor
   circulating cortisol concentrations. Exogenous cortisol affected mean
   trait expression of plasma cortisol levels, struggle docility and escape
   latency. Repeatability of cortisol and escape latency was increased and
   repeatability of struggle docility tended to be higher (approaching
   significance) in treated individuals. Increased repeatability was mainly
   caused by an increase of among-individual variance. Correlations among
   docility, escape latency and cortisol were stronger in treated animals
   compared to control animals. These results suggest that exposure to
   elevated levels of cortisol during adolescence can alter animal
   personality traits as well as behavioural syndromes. Social and
   risk-taking traits showed no correlation with cortisol levels and were
   unaffected by the experimental manipulation, indicating behavioural
   modularity. Taken together, our data highlight that cortisol can have
   organising effects during adolescence on the development of personality
   traits and behavioural syndromes, adding to the increasing evidence that
   not only early life but also adolescence is an important sensitive
   period for behavioural development.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Environmental variation strongly influences individual life histories,
   behavior, and immunity. For many animals living in non-tropical regions,
   environmental variation due to season is very important and can be
   reliably predicted by photoperiod. By manipulating the pre- and
   post-natal photoperiod for cavies (Cavia aperea), we simulated different
   birth seasons that go along with predictable differences in life
   history. Offspring born into simulated spring conditions mature earlier,
   indicating a fast pace of life compared to offspring born into simulated
   fall. We investigated the development of two innate (titers of natural
   antibodies and complement) and one adaptive (immunoglobulin G) immune
   effectors across multiple life stages. In addition, we tested if three
   behaviors, indicating risk-taking and stress-coping, differed between
   seasons. Finally, we tested if behaviors and immune traits correlate
   with each other as predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis.
   The season of birth influenced average trait expression of both immunity
   and behavior. Boldness, indicating risk-taking behavior, correlated
   positively with the titers of natural antibodies, fitting the
   predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS). However, fearlessness,
   indicating how an individual copes with a stressful situation,
   correlated positively with immunoglobulin G concentrations, against the
   predictions of the POLS. Together, our results show that behaviors and
   immune traits react to differences in expected life histories, but do
   not show the predicted covariation. We conclude that proximate
   mechanisms and different functions of traits need to be considered to
   predict the nature of behavior-immune associations.
   Individual life histories, behavior, and immunity are strongly
   influenced by the environment individual's experience during early life.
   Recent theory predicts correlations between behavior and immunity to
   arise as a consequence of different life histories. By simulating
   different birth seasons, we induced different life history expectations
   as well as a season-dependent development of immunity and behavior.
   However, correlations between behavior and immunity do not fit
   theoretical predictions, highlighting the need for more detailed theory.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions strongly affect ecological dynamics.
   Consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour (individual
   behavioural types, BTs) of predator and prey (or both) may fundamentally
   shape their mutual interactions. Several recent studies have shown that
   it is important to consider the interaction of BTs on both sides of
   predator-prey interactions. Otherwise, there is a high risk of erroneous
   inference about the outcome of predation. Until now, however, no study
   has investigated how BT vs BT interaction affects the predation of
   mesopredators by top predators, especially when the mesopredator is a
   low-ranked prey for the top predator. Such knowledge is extremely
   important if we want to predict the effect of individual BTs on food web
   dynamics. We have investigated in our laboratory experiments how
   foraging aggressiveness of the top predator (spider, Philodromus
   cespitum, Philodromidae) and risk-aversion as a form of shyness of the
   mesopredator (spider, Philodromus albidus, Philodromidae) determine the
   probability of predation. The highest explanatory power had the model
   with additive effects of mesopredator's risk-aversion and top predator's
   foraging aggressiveness. Other models, including those with BT vs BT
   interaction, had poor explanatory power. It was probably due to the fact
   that timid top predators are often choosy and do not catch low-ranked
   prey, while aggressive top predators are opportunists. The risk-averse
   mesopredators are also more cautious than risk-prone mesopredators
   regarding their surroundings and can defend themselves faster. Our
   results therefore fit with the classical hypothesis about trade-off
   between foraging and safety.
   Behavioural types of predator and prey jointly determine the mortality
   of prey. In our laboratory experiments, we investigated how foraging
   aggressiveness of a top predator spider and the risk-aversion of a
   mesopredator spider (potential prey) determine the probability of
   predation. We demonstrated that top predator's foraging aggressiveness
   and mesopredator's risk-aversion determine the probability of
   mesopredator's mortality only additively. The mesopredator's probability
   of being killed decreased with its risk-aversion and increased with top
   predator's foraging aggressiveness. The effect was additive instead of
   interactive because the mesopredator represents a dangerous prey for the
   top predator. The timid top predators are also choosy and do not attack
   dangerous prey, while the aggressive/non-choosy top predators are
   opportunistic. Further, the risk-averse mesopredators are more cautious
   regarding their surroundings and can react faster to the presence of a
   top predator, compared to risk-prone and slowly reacting mesopredators.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-scale underwater telemetry affords an unprecedented opportunity to
   understand how aquatic animals respond to environmental changes. We
   investigated the movement patterns of an aquatic top predator, Eurasian
   perch (Perca fluviatilis), using a three-dimensional acoustic telemetry
   system installed in Kleiner Dollnsee (25ha), a small, shallow,
   mesotrophic natural lake. Adult piscivorous perch (N=16) were tagged and
   tracked in the whole lake at a minimum of 9-s intervals over the course
   of one year. Perch increased swimming activity with higher water
   temperature and light intensity. Air pressure, wind speed and lunar
   phase also explained perch movements, but the effects were substantially
   smaller compared to temperature and light. Perch showed a strong diel
   pattern in activity, with farther swimming distances and larger activity
   spaces during the daytime, compared to the night-time. To investigate
   the influence of prey distribution, we sampled the prey fish in both
   littoral and pelagic zones in both day and night monthly using gill
   nets. We found that the prey fish underwent diel horizontal migration,
   using the littoral zone during the day and the pelagic zone during the
   night. However, perch showed the opposite patterns, suggesting either
   that the prey fish avoided predation risk or that the horizontal diel
   migration of perch was driven by other mechanisms. Our results
   collectively suggest that the movement ecology of piscivorous perch is
   mainly governed by a foraging motivation as a function of abiotic
   variables, especially temperature and light.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic integration in an extended phenotype: among-individual

Abstract = {{Structures such as nests and burrows are an essential component of many
   organisms' life-cycle and require a complex sequence of behaviours.
   Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be
   correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would
   (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into
   distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among
   functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these
   hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a
   solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata
   constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear
   series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined
   variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction
   (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length
   and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number
   of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We
   found a general decline in investment in cell construction and
   provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence
   for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little
   evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were
   positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r0.15), and traits were loosely
   organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual
   differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to
   that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly
   integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of
   independent evolutionary trajectories.}},

Title = {{Aggressive desert goby males also court more, independent of the
   physiological demands of salinity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Both between- and within-individual variation in behaviour can be
   important in determining mating opportunities and reproductive outcomes.
   Such behavioural variability can be induced by environmental conditions,
   especially if individuals vary in their tolerance levels or resource
   allocation patterns. We tested the effects of exposure to different
   salinity levels on male investment into two important components of
   mating success-intrasexual aggression and intersexual courtship-in a
   fish with a resource defence mating system, the desert goby,
   Chlamydogobius eremius. We found that males that were more aggressive to
   rivals also exhibited higher rates of courtship displays towards
   females. Contrary to predictions, this positive relationship, and the
   consistency of the two behaviours, were not affected by the salinity
   treatment, despite the physiological costs that high salinity imposes on
   the species. Moreover, over the entire data-set, there was only a
   marginally non-significant tendency for males to show higher levels of
   aggression and courtship in low, than high, salinity. The positive
   correlation between male aggression and courtship, independent of the
   physiological demands of the environment, suggests that males are not
   inclined to make contrasting resource investments into these two key
   reproductive behaviours. Instead, in this relatively euryhaline
   freshwater species, typical investment into current reproductive
   behaviours can occur under a range of different salinity conditions.}},

Title = {{Repeatability and reproductive consequences of boldness in female gray

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wild animals show consistent individual variation in behavior across
   time and/or contexts, now referred to as animal personality. While this
   variability may have important ecological and evolutionary implications,
   how and why variation in animal personality is maintained in a natural
   population remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of
   environmental and biological sources of variation on behavioral
   responses measured along the shy-bold continuum in a long-lived,
   iteroparous marine mammal, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). Between
   2008 and 2016, 469 females from the Sable Island, Nova Scotia breeding
   colony of gray seals were given a boldness score in response to a human
   approach, designed to stimulate maternal defense of offspring. Using
   generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework,
   we show that boldness is highly repeatable between and within years.
   There were age differences in boldness, with younger females being less
   bold than older, more experienced females providing some support for the
   life history trade-off hypothesis. We further used GLMMs to assess
   sources of variation on offspring weaning mass. We found that young
   females that were bolder produced heavier pups than shyer counterparts,
   and that pups produced by bolder females were on average 2 kg heavier
   than pups of shy females. These results provide further evidence that
   personality influences life history strategies, and illustrates the
   evolutionary potential of animal personality in response to selection.
   Consistent individual differences in behavior influence various aspects
   of ecology including species interactions, species distributions, and
   life history strategies. However, how and why this individual variation
   is maintained in a natural population remains uncertain. In this study,
   we assessed the influence of boldness, specifically maternal defense of
   offspring, on a component of reproductive success in a long-lived marine
   mammal. We showed highly repeatable behavioral differences, and found
   that boldness varied with age, with younger individuals being less bold
   than older individuals. Younger individuals that were bolder produced
   heavier offspring than shyer counterparts. Our study contributes to an
   under-represented group of animals, wild marine mammals, in the
   personality literature, and further prompts the investigation into the
   proximate and ultimate factors influencing personality in an
   ecologically important marine predator.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', the phenomenon of consistent individual
   differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely,
   yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence
   remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural
   variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on
   resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool
   prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk
   exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified
   open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual
   (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this
   species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent
   with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in
   size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high
   repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP
   (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations
   between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that
   individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not
   consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome'
   in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated
   with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some
   individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources,
   while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration
   (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource
   patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited
   resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality
   variation observed in wild populations. (C) 2018 The Association for the

   exploratory behaviour (performance in novel food, object and environment
   test, startle test) on the ability of individual birds to assess the
   threat represented by a predator. We presented a wooden dummy of the
   European sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), an extremely dangerous predator,
   and its visual modifications (chimeras), changing the beak or head to be
   non-threatening (those of a pigeon - Columba Livia f domestica). We
   showed that the differences between `slow' and `fast explorers' are not
   very distinct, but that `slow explorers' generally tended to be more
   cautious in the presence of an unmodified sparrowhawk dummy, while the
   `fast explorers' tended to observe the dummy. On the contrary, `slow
   explorers' tended to treat both chimaeras (and the pigeon dummy as well)
   as less-threatening than `fast explorers'. Since `slow explorers' are
   usually considered to be more sensitive to environmental cues, it came
   as no surprise that most of them correctly assessed the unmodified
   sparrowhawk dummy as threatening, while they probably subjected the
   chimeras to a detailed inspection and were not confused by the presence
   of sparrowhawk features and assessed them as non-threatening.}},

   Theory perspective}},

Abstract = {{Trait impulsivity is an increasingly relevant topic for human and
   non-human animal personality research. There are similarities in dog and
   human manifestations of trait impulsivity at the behavioural, genetic,
   and neurobiological level. We investigated a well-validated measure of
   dog impulsivity and responsivity (the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale,
   DIAS) and a neuropsychological theory of human trait approach and
   avoidance (the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality, RST).
   Owners reported their dogs' dispositional behaviour on the DIAS, an RST
   scale modified to describe dogs' behaviour, and a list of common dog
   behaviour problems. In a sample of 730 dogs, we observed convergence
   between the RST and the DIAS. There was a negative correlation between
   RST `Behaviour Inhibition System' and DIAS impulsivity factor
   ('Behavioural Regulation'). RST `Behavioural Approach System' correlated
   positively with DIAS `Responsiveness'. The RST `Fight-Flight-Freeze
   System' (FFFS) and the DIAS `Aggression and response to novelty factor
   were both distinct from other factors. However, the DIAS `Aggression and
   response to novelty' factor and the RST FFFS explained different aspects
   of dog behaviour problems. Importantly, whilst the DIAS factors
   indicated tendencies towards avoidant behaviours, the FFFS discriminated
   between active and passive avoidance. The findings suggest a partial
   overlapping between the DIAS and RST scales, and highlights the utility
   of personality models in investigating behaviour problems in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behavioral types (i.e., personality traits) and their
   interrelations (i.e., behavioral syndrome) are recognized in arthropods
   and are of ecological and evolutionary importance. This aspect is also
   important in applied entomology, as distinct personality types may
   exhibit different fitness consequences. Here, we attempt to understand
   how within-population variation in a personality trait responds to
   selection and affects other personality traits. Our main focus was a
   quantifiable behavioral trait (i.e., walking velocity), its potential
   association with other personality traits, and how these traits are
   related to the reproductive output. The maize weevil (Sitophilus
   zeamais), a key pest of stored cereal grains, was used to test these
   hypotheses, and we detected that walking velocity is amenable to
   selection in this species. Furthermore, bidirectional selection with
   regard to walking velocity (i.e., either high or low) had an impact on
   the behavioral type, thereby allowing the recognition of different
   behavioral patterns among the strains. The generated multi-dimensional
   behavioral constructs of personality indicate consistent divergence
   among the strains with a stronger contribution of the activity
   dimension. Walking velocity was associated with other behavioral traits,
   particularly within the activity dimension, indicating the existence of
   a behavioral syndrome in the maize weevil. Furthermore, this behavioral
   dimension (i.e., activity), and particularly walking velocity, was
   associated with the reproductive output of maize weevil.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal
   personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked
   whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions
   similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent
   across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish
   (Gambusia affinis) as our study organism, we characterized focal
   individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and
   sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral
   repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two
   different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between
   computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in
   body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different
   effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than
   average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with
   increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive
   personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher
   shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming
   females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of
   preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may
   reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social
   dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for
   assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the
   existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals' choosiness across mate
   choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our
   present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of
   personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of phenotypic behavioral correlations and their connection
   to fitness consequences of organisms have received considerable debate
   within the literature. Yet, little work has been carried out to connect
   any behavioral correlates found within a set of laboratory studies to
   natural behavior observed under complex environmental conditions. To
   help fill this gap, individual crayfish, collected from the same local
   population, completed five different behavioral assays in a laboratory
   setting in a random order. These data were used to reveal any possible
   correlations for behavioral scores across all of the laboratory tests.
   Subsequently, these same individuals were placed into the field and
   video recorded for 24hr. A separate set of field behaviors, related to
   the laboratory assays, were quantified from the field videos. The
   normalized laboratory and field behaviors were used in three stepwise
   statistical analyses. First, normalized data were loaded into a PCA to
   generate a priori hypotheses on potential behavioral correlates. These
   hypotheses were subsequently tested using general multiple linear
   regression. Finally, structural equation modeling was performed to
   elucidate any behavioral modules from the laboratory assays that
   correlated with behavioral patterns present from the fieldwork. Three
   laboratory-based behavioral modules were connected to three separate
   field assays: exploration-avoidance, bold-shy, and aggressiveness. Yet,
   some behaviors exhibited in the laboratory assays were uncorrelated with
   any behaviors found in the field and vice versa. Results from this study
   provide evidence that although many different behavioral correlates may
   exist within laboratory settings, these same modules may not translate
   directly into predicting behavior under natural settings.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecifics vary consistently in their behavioural responses towards
   environment stimuli such as exposure to novel objects; ethologists often
   refer to this variability as animal personality. The neurological
   mechanisms underlying animal personality traits remain largely unknown,
   but linking the individual variation in emotional expression to brain
   structural and neurochemical factors is attracting renewed interest.
   While considerable research has focused on hormonal and neurotransmitter
   effects on behavioural responses, less is known about how individual
   variation in the number of specific neuron populations contributes to
   individual variation in behaviour. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and
   the central nuclei of the amygdala (CeA) mediate emotional processing by
   regulating behavioural responses of animals in a potentially threatening
   situation. As such, these structures are good candidates for evaluating
   the relationship between neuronal populations and behavioural traits. We
   now show that individual American mink (Neovison vison) reacting more
   boldly towards novelty have more neurons in the BLA than do their more
   timid conspecifics, suggesting that a developmental pattern of the
   number of amygdala neurons can influence behavioural traits of an adult
   animal. Furthermore, post hoc correlations revealed that individuals
   performing with higher arousal, as reflected by their frequency of
   startle behaviour, have more CeA neurons. Our results support a direct
   link between the number of neurons in amygdala regions and aspects of
   animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{A whole suite of parameters is likely to influence the behavior and
   performance of individuals as adults, including correlations between
   phenotypic traits or an individual's developmental context. Here, we ask
   the question whether behavior and physical performance traits are
   correlated and how early life parameters such as birth weight, litter
   size, and growth can influence these traits as measured during
   adulthood. We studied 486 captive gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus)
   and measured two behavioral traits and two performance traits
   potentially involved in two functions: exploration behavior with pull
   strength and agitation score with bite force. We checked for the
   existence of behavioral consistency in behaviors and explored
   correlations between behavior, performance, morphology. We analyzed the
   effect of birth weight, growth, and litter size, while controlling for
   age, sex, and body weight. Behavior and performance were not correlated
   with one another, but were both influenced by age. Growth rate had a
   positive effect on adult morphology, and birth weight significantly
   affected emergence latency and bite force. Grip strength was not
   directly affected by early life traits, but bite performance and
   exploration behavior were impacted by birth weight. This study shows how
   early life parameters impact personality and performance.}},

   humans. If this positive welfare effect is also true for non-humans,
   animals with high levels of curiosity may be able to cope better with
   stressful situations than their conspecifics. Before discoveries can be
   made regarding the effect of curiosity on an animals ability to cope in
   their environment, a way of measuring curiosity across species in
   different environments must be created to standardise testing. To
   determine the suitability of novel objects in testing curiosity, species
   from different evolutionary backgrounds with sufficient sample sizes
   were chosen. Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) n = 12, little penguins
   (Eudyptula minor) n = 10, ringtail lemurs (Lemur catta) n = 8, red
   tailed black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksia) n = 7, Indian star
   tortoises (Geochelone elegans) n = 5 and red kangaroos (Macropus rufus)
   n = 5 were presented with a stationary object, a moving object and a
   mirror. Having objects with different characteristics increased the
   likelihood individuals would find at least one motivating. Conspecifics
   were all assessed simultaneously for time to first orientate towards
   object (s), latency to make contact (s), frequency of interactions, and
   total duration of interaction (s). Differences in curiosity were
   recorded in four of the six species; the Barbary sheep and red tailed
   black cockatoos did not interact with the novel objects suggesting
   either a low level of curiosity or that the objects were not motivating
   for these animals. Variation in curiosity was seen between and within
   species in terms of which objects they interacted with and how long they
   spent with the objects. This was determined by the speed in which they
   interacted, and the duration of interest. By using the measure of
   curiosity towards novel objects with varying characteristics across a
   range of zoo species, we can see evidence of evolutionary, husbandry and
   individual influences on their response. Further work to obtain data on
   multiple captive populations of a single species using a standardised
   method could uncover factors that nurture the development of curiosity.
   In doing so, it would be possible to isolate and modify sub-optimal
   husbandry practices to improve welfare in the zoo environment.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{In many taxa, individual social traits appear to be consistent across
   time and context, thus meeting the criteria for animal personality. How
   these differences are maintained in response to changes in population
   density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates.
   Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how
   among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured
   using social network analyses, change as a function of population
   density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated
   into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females
   were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded
   social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting
   radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic
   association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective
   of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and
   degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social
   connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual
   variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals
   oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in
   density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate
   density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing
   density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social
   connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher
   density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social
   benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study
   illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a
   density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity.
   Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density
   dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent
   individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in
   other ecological processes ( e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice,
   disease transfer).}},

Abstract = {{Optimal life-history strategies are currently considered to be a major
   driving force for the maintenance of animal personalities. In this
   experimental study we tested whether naturally occurring predation
   causes personality dependent mortality of a marine isopod (Idotea
   balthica), which could maintain personality variation in nature.
   Moreover, as isopods are known to have sex-differences in behaviour, we
   were interested in whether personality-dependent predation was
   sex-specific. We also hypothesised that predation pressure among
   personality types could vary according to habitat type, as it has been
   shown in correlative studies that habitat may influence personality
   variation. We used natural predator (European perch Perca fluviatilis)
   of I. balthica and studied relative mortality of males and females with
   a different personality types in laboratory settings with two different
   habitats. We found that survival in males was lower than in females for
   high active individuals. Moreover, survival under predation was linked
   to body size differently in females and males. This, however, depended
   on personality class as larger size was advantageous for low-active
   males and middle- and high-active females. Conversely, smaller size was
   advantageous for low-active females and middle-active males. Size did
   not affect survival in high-active males. Our results suggest that
   predation can encourage life-history differences between sexes leading
   to different optimal life-history strategies and also maintains
   consistent activity for both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of individual behavioural variation within and among
   animal populations has become a popular topic of investigation in
   behavioural ecology. So far, research has revealed the complexity of the
   phenomenon, and how much there is left to learn about its underlying
   causes, and potential consequences. Yet, behavioural variation among
   individuals need not be constrained to the animal kingdom. Animal
   personality, and the lessons we have learned about it, could apply to
   other fields of inquiry as well. Interestingly, these fields do not have
   to be constrained to biology. Here, the hidden parallels between animal
   personality and the ongoing efforts to develop artifical general
   intelligence will be identified. This points towards a neglected aspect
   in the consideration of potential effects artificial general
   intelligence (AGI) may have: it could have a personality'.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of animal contests have focused on the probability of winning an
   encounter, because it directly affects the benefits of competition.
   However, the costs (e.g., physiological stress) and benefits of
   competition should also depend on the number of aggressive encounters
   per unit time (combat rate, hereafter) in which the focal individual is
   involved. Using colourful and drab male house finches (Haemorhous
   mexicanus) from urban and rural sites, we showed that combat rate was
   repeatable across the same and different group sizes for birds who won
   competitions. In addition, colourful urban males exhibited the lowest
   propensity for frequent aggression (and hence low combat rate). However,
   male bill size (another trait we previously found to correlate with male
   competitiveness in this species) was not related to aggressive
   propensity. Combat rate can be predicted by male identity and some, but
   not all, predictors of male competitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-trait, multi-test approach to investigate the convergence or
   discrimination between behavioural tests putatively targeting the same
   or different animal personality traits has been recommended, yet whether
   and how the approaches affect the identification of behavioural
   syndrome(s), the suite of correlated personality traits, requires
   investigation. Here, we used behavioural measures collected from five
   commonly used behavioural tests targeting three personality traits,
   evaluated their convergence/discrimination through exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA), and then explored whether the identification of syndrome
   changed based on the approach we used to quantify personality traits.
   Our results indicated that tests presumably targeting the same
   personality trait actually measured distinct behavioural aspects.
   Syndrome defined using correlation changed due to how we identified
   personality traits, but not when using structural equation models
   (SEMs). Overall, this study emphasizes that it is critical to clarify
   the approach and terms we use for `personality traits' in the field of

Abstract = {{Consistent individual behavioural differences ('animal personalities')

   tested whether female mating preferences were non-random with respect to
   male and female neophobia in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), an
   important avian model of mate choice and animal personality research.
   Male and female neophobia was assessed by attaching novel objects to
   birds' feeders. Females' mating preferences were tested with randomly
   assigned, unfamiliar males in a four-way choice apparatus. Females
   associated most with males with neophobia scores similar to their own.
   These results provide evidence that mating preferences and personality
   traits can covary, supporting evolutionary scenarios of assortative
   mating contributing to the maintenance of personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Research on brood parasitism has focused primarily on specific host
   anti-parasite behaviours and parasite counter-adaptations, and little is
   known about other aspects of their behaviours such as consistent
   behavioural differences between individuals. Therefore, we examined
   consistency in behaviour of nestlings of common cuckoos (Cuculus
   canorus) raised by great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus).
   Cuckoo chicks showed high repeatability of both aggressive behaviour and
   breath rate, and both traits were strongly correlated with each other.
   This represents the first evidence for consistent differences in
   behaviour among avian brood parasites. Males were consistently more
   aggressive and less stressed than females. Nestlings of both sexes that
   hatched later in the season exhibited higher levels of aggression and
   lower stress responses than nestlings hatched earlier. This suggests
   that rearing conditions (e.g., food availability and quality) may
   modulate stress and aggressive phenotypes of brood parasites. We discuss
   potential effects of the observed patterns on host-parasite dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural plasticity is important for survival and to adapt to a
   dynamic environment. However, it is known that many animals exhibit
   fixed behavioural responses termed behavioural syndromes. That said,
   even when exhibiting such fixed behavioural responses, animals still
   show variability in their behaviour. We here evaluate the variability in
   exploration behaviour in the frog Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis by
   quantifying two different metrics of variability: the absolute
   difference between two sets of measurements, and the individual
   stability statistic. Our results show differences in the
   intra-individual variability between groups of frogs that can be
   assigned to different behavioural syndromes. Marked differences in
   variability also occur between males and females, with males being more
   stereotyped in their responses. Frogs identified as belonging to
   different behavioural groups (i.e. shy, intermediate, and bold) differed
   in the variability of the expression of these strategies, with bold
   individuals being more stereotypic in the exploration of an identical,
   novel environment. These observations may have implications for the
   evolution of behaviour in natural populations.}},

Title = {{When honesty and cheating pay off: the evolution of honest and dishonest
   equilibria in a conventional signalling game}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: The reliability of signals is a key issue in the study of
   animal communication. Both empirical work and theoretical models show
   that communication need not be entirely honest, and thus signals can be
   deceitful. Aggressive communication appears to be a prime candidate for
   such deceitful communication, because bluffing has been described in
   several species. Bluffing in these situations are supposed to be
   maintained by frequency dependent selection where the fitness of a given
   type depends on the frequencies of the other types in the population.
   Previous efforts to model such a scenario through individual based
   simulations have yielded conflicting results. Studies have either found
   a rich set of polymorphic strategies including the traditional cheating
   scenario or found none. Thus, the modelling assumptions responsible for
   these diverging conclusions remain unclear.
   Results: In this study, I investigate the effects of four modelling
   assumptions: the role of an extended strategy set, the initial
   population composition (seeding), the differences in pay-offs and
   finally different parameter spaces. I investigate the effects of these
   factors on the evolvability of both honest and mixed cheating
   strategies. I show that both honest and cheating equilibria readily
   evolve and that the investigated parameter range and the seeding of the
   starting populations have the greatest influence on the outcome.
   Conclusions: Both honest signalling and polymorphic cheating equilibria
   are more likely to evolve from a narrow strategy set than from a random
   mixture of strategies. A large potential strategy set is not a setback
   for the evolution of communication-honest or cheating-as long as the
   initial population is seeded with only a few strategies. In addition,
   different sections of the parameter space show consistently different
   behaviour. Thus, frequency dependent selection has the potential to
   explain various empirical observations that show consistent differences
   in aggressive behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Considering that each personality type in animals presents distinct

   efficiency of the Novel Environment test to classify larvae of
   Lophiosilurus alexandri into bold and shy individuals, which were then
   investigated for growth, cannibalism and mortality in larviculture of
   pure and mixed groups. Larvae with an average weight of 24.0 +/- 1.7 mg
   and length of 14.1 +/- 0.4 mm, were subjected to a Novel Environment
   test to classify their personality type (bold and shy larvae). After the
   larvae were classified according to personality type, they were
   subjected to larviculture for 15 days. Three treatments were tested:
   only bold larvae, only shy larvae, and a mixed treatment (bold larvae +
   shy larvae) at a density for 16 larvae/L, which were fed 3 times a day
   with Anemia nauplii. After larviculture, there were no differences in
   the final lengths of larvae of the bold, shy, and mixed treatments (26.9
   +/- 0.76 mm, 26.7 +/- 1.00 mm, and 26.8 +/- 1.24 mm, respectively);
   however, shy larvae possessed weighed less (0.22 +/- 0.01 g) than the
   bold and mixed treatments, which did not differ significantly (0.25 +/-
   0.02 g and 0.27 +/- 0.02 g, respectively). The bold and mixed treatments
   had the highest cannibalism rate (11.2 +/- 5.1\% and 23.1 +/- 12.3\%,
   respectively). Overall survival was lowest in the mixed treatment (62.5
   +/- 13.0\%), while that of the bold and shy treatments were similar
   (82.5 +/- 9.2\% and 86.2 +/- 9.2\%, respectively). The separation of L.
   alexandri larvae by traits can ensure a decrease in cannibalism and
   hence, more productive larviculture.}},

Title = {{An efficient method for sorting and quantifying individual social traits
   based on group-level behaviour}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1735-1744}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. In social contexts, animal behaviour is often studied in terms of
   group-level characteristics. One clear example of this is the collective
   motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and
   fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level
   behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few
   methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often
   limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to
   experimental data.
   2. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals
   according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even
   tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to
   behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are
   rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations
   of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this
   method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a
   variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each
   case.
   3. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute
   equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the
   between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for
   groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group
   feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across
   the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how
   individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the
   experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level
   repeatability of the underlying traits.
   4. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in
   social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals.
   Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons
   between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the
   behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for
   testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups
   or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially
   relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments,
   and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method
   provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence
   social behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Human-induced biological invasions are common worldwide and often have
   negative impacts on wildlife and human societies. Several studies have
   shown evidence for selection on invaders after introduction to the new
   range. However, selective processes already acting prior to introduction
   have been largely neglected. Here, we tested whether such early
   selection acts on known behaviour-related gene variants in the
   yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer), a pet-traded African songbird.
   We tested for nonrandom allele frequency changes after trapping,
   acclimation and survival in captivity. We also compared the native
   source population with two independent invasive populations. Allele
   frequencies of two SNPs in the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene-known to
   be linked to behavioural activity in response to novelty in this
   species-significantly changed over all early invasion stages. They also
   differed between the African native population and the two invading
   European populations. The two-locus genotype associated with reduced
   activity declined consistently, but strongest at the trapping stage.
   Overall genetic diversity did not substantially decrease, and there is
   little evidence for new alleles in the introduced populations,
   indicating that selection at the DRD4 gene predominantly worked on the
   standing genetic variation already present in the native population. Our
   study demonstrates selection on a behaviour-related gene during the
   first stages of a biological invasion. Thus, pre-establishment stages of
   a biological invasion do not only determine the number of propagules
   that are introduced (their quantity), but also their phenotypic and
   genetic characteristics (their quality).}},

Abstract = {{Trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of animal
   personality. Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between
   behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for
   behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny.
   The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and
   behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However,
   the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare.
   Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and
   juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures
   than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound
   changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In
   this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the
   desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate
   behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life
   stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature
   females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater
   aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their
   environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory
   cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations
   do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between
   aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature
   males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable
   across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that
   behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our
   results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait
   values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with
   developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation,
   albeit at different time points in males and females. This period of the
   life cycle merits systematic examination across taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Both individual variation in dispersal tendency and animal personalities
   have been shown to be widespread in nature. They are often associated in
   personality-dependent dispersal, and both have major but
   underappreciated consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics.
   In addition, changes in animal personality can appear through ontogeny,
   leading to life stage-dependent behaviours. We investigated
   relationships between dispersal, life stage and boldness in an
   invertebrate with between- and within-life stages variation in dispersal
   tendency, the land snail Cornu aspersum. Latency to exit the shell
   following a simulated attack was repeatable, indicating boldness is a
   personality trait in Cornu aspersum. Subadults were bolder and more
   dispersive than adults. Dispersers were bolder than non-dispersers,
   independently of boldness changes between life stages. We discuss how
   these results can be explained in relation with life history strategies
   in this hermaphrodite species, in particular risk management in the
   context of reproductive investment.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding whether and how ambient ecological conditions affect the
   distribution of personality types within and among populations lies at
   the heart of research on animal personality. Several studies have
   focussed on only one agent of divergent selection (or driver of plastic
   changes in behavior), considering either predation risk or a single
   abiotic ecological factor. Here, we investigated how an array of abiotic
   and biotic environmental factors simultaneously shape population
   differences in boldness, activity in an open-field test, and
   sociability/shoaling in the livebearing fish Poecilia vivipara from six
   ecologically different lagoons in southeastern Brazil. We evaluated the
   relative contributions of variation in predation risk, water
   transparency/visibility, salinity (ranging from oligo-to hypersaline),
   and dissolved oxygen. We also investigated the role played by
   environmental factors for the emergence, strength, and direction of
   behavioral correlations. Water transparency explained most of the
   behavioral variation, whereby fish from lagoons with low water
   transparency were significantly shyer, less active, and shoaled less
   than fish living under clear water conditions. When we tested additional
   wild-caught fish from the same lagoons after acclimating them to
   homogeneous laboratory conditions, population differences were largely
   absent, pointing toward behavioral plasticity as a mechanism underlying
   the observed behavioral differences. Furthermore, we found correlations
   between personality traits (behavioral syndromes) to vary substantially
   in strength and direction among populations, with no obvious
   associations with ecological factors (including predation risk).
   Altogether, our results suggest that various habitat parameters
   simultaneously shape the distribution of personality types, with abiotic
   factors playing a vital (as yet underestimated) role. Furthermore, while
   predation is often thought to lead to the emergence of behavioral
   syndromes, our data do not support this assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Research on animal personality is increasingly demonstrating that
   individuals in a population are characterised by distinct sets of
   behavioural traits that show consistency over time and across different
   situations. Parasites are known to alter the behaviour of their hosts,
   although their role in shaping host personality remains little studied.
   Here, we test the effect of trematode infection on two traits of their
   host's personality, activity and boldness, in nymphs of the red
   damselfly Xanthocnemis zealandica. Genetic analyses indicate that the
   undescribed trematode species falls within the superfamily
   Microphalloidea. Results of laboratory behavioural tests indicate that
   the two behavioural traits are related to each other: bolder individuals
   also show higher levels of spontaneous activity than shy ones. However,
   parasite infection had no effect on either of these behaviours or on
   their repeatability over three separate testing sessions. Although our
   findings suggest that this trematode does not influence personality
   traits of the damselfly host, it remains possible that other standard
   personality traits not tested here (exploratory tendency,
   aggressiveness) are affected by infection.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been studied extensively in recent years, yet
   multidimensionality in tendencies of risk-related behavior, and the role
   of such consistency from a mating tactics perspective, is yet to be
   investigated. We used a semi-domesticated herd of reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus) to examine individual subdominant male propensity to risk
   mating attempts on guarded females, as well as flight initiation
   distance (FID), within the personality paradigm to elucidate potential
   fitness consequences of consistency from an adaptive perspective. Data
   were collected at the Kutuharju Reindeer Research Station in Kaamanen,
   Finland, where measures of personality were generated using field
   observation data based on the relative frequency of dominant
   male-subdominant male agonistic interactions over 4years and subdominant
   males' FID measured over 1year. Individual propensity for transient
   mating attempts was not significantly repeatable and did not
   significantly predict reproductive success or somatic cost during the
   mating season. Individuals varied consistently in FID, and although
   repeatable, FID was not related to reproductive success or somatic cost.
   Proximate state-dependent or social mechanisms may be driving
   decision-making with respect to mating effort, whereas consistent
   between-individual differences in FID may be maintained by mechanisms
   unrelated to life-history trade-offs involving productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary: Animal personality research is a growing field, since
   understanding animal personalities has notable implications in ecology
   and the evolution of animal behaviours. In the current study, we tested
   different methods described in the literature to obtain robust
   individual behavioural profiles. Data collected through behavioral
   observations were categorised into activity budgets, space usage, and
   social interactions for each individual. In addition, behavioural
   profile questionnaires were completed by the three zoo keepers who had
   regular interactions with the bears. The questionnaires included 22
   adjectives, which were rated on a scale of 1-12 depending on how well
   they described each individual bear. The mean ratings of the keepers
   were used to create the behavioural profiles by adding the adjectives to
   the appropriate domains, according to the NEO Five Factor Inventory of
   personality model (NEO-FFI). The data gathered was used to produce
   behavioural profiles for all animals, in order to clarify the
   personality characteristics of each subject. Testing and improving
   existing methodologies to determine animal personality is important for
   providing optimal welfare and management of captive animals, since it
   can help to develop more effective management regimes in zoos by
   remodelling husbandry according to each animal's personality type.
   Abstract: Three brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) individuals and two
   sloth bear (Melursus ursinus inornatus) individuals were observed in
   captivity to produce behavioural profiles for each individual. Data
   collected through behavioural observations were used to produce activity
   budgets, and to identify space usage and certain aspects of social
   behavior. Behaviour monitoring allowed the researchers to evaluate the
   welfare of the animals by identifying the occurrence of stereotypic
   behaviours, which are sometimes associated with stress. Behavioural
   profiles were created using data obtained through behavioural
   observations (coding) and keeper questionnaires (rating). The
   behavioural observations indicated a number of stereotypic behaviours in
   sloth bears but not in brown bears. The uniformity of zone usage was
   calculated to investigate if the enclosure size and features were
   adequate for use, and a social aspect of otherwise solitary animals was
   also identified. The behavioural profiles generated through coding and
   rating were compared to determine the reliability between these two
   methods in Ursids. Profiles were not compared between individuals since
   this study is not a comparison between different personality types but
   rather an effort (one of the few ones existing in literature) to select
   a valid and reproducible methodology capable of assessing personality in
   bears.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Individual dietary specialisation can occur within populations even when
   average diets suggest that the population has a generalist feeding
   strategy. Individual specialisation may impact fitness and has been
   related to demographic traits, ecological opportunity, competition,
   learning and animal personality. However, the causation and formation of
   individual specialisation are not fully understood. Experiments on
   animals raised in controlled environments provide an opportunity to
   examine dietary preferences and learning largely independent from
   variation in lifetime experiences and ecological opportunity. Here, we
   use a feeding experiment to examine individual specialisation and
   learning in captive bred European mink (Mustela lutreola) in an Estonian
   conservation programme. In a series of cafeteria experiments, animals
   could choose between one familiar food item (Baltic herring Clupea
   harengus membras) and two initially novel ones (noble crayfish Astacus
   astacus and house mouse Mus musculus). In general, mice were rarely
   eaten whilst crayfish consumption increased over time and fish
   decreased. At the individual level, there was a mix of generalists and
   crayfish or fish specialists, and the individuals differed in learning
   time in relation to novel prey. Our results indicate that individual
   variation in innate preferences and learning both contributes to
   individual diet specialisation. The differences in learning indicate
   individual variation in behavioural plasticity, which in turn can be
   related to personality. This could be of concern in conservation, as
   personality has been shown to affect survival in translocations.}},

Title = {{Ontogenetic comparisons of standard metabolism in three species of
   crocodilians}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Due in part to their large size, aggressive temperament, and difficulty
   in handling, there are few physiological studies of adult crocodilians
   in the literature. As a result, studies comparing individuals across an
   ontogenetic series and comparisons among species are also lacking. We
   addressed this gap in knowledge by measuring standard metabolic rates
   (SMR) of three species of crocodilians (Crocodylus porosus, C. johnsoni,
   and Alligator mississippiensis), and included individuals that ranged
   from 0.22 to 114 kg. Allometric scaling of SMR with body mass was
   similar among the species, but C. porosus had significantly higher SMR
   than did C. johnsoni or A. mississippiensis. Differences in SMR among
   species are potentially related to behavioural differences in levels of
   aggression; C. porosus are the most aggressive of the crocodilians
   measured, and have rates of standard metabolism that are approximately
   36\% higher at the grand mean body size than those measured for C.
   johnsoni or A. mississippiensis, which are among the least aggressive
   crocodilians.}},

Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-47}},
Abstract = {{Most organisms live in heterogeneous environments. Yet we know little
   about how variations in scales of heterogeneity influence decisions on
   patch use and habitat selection, and how they impact spatial
   distribution and evolution. In particular, we need to know whether the
   choice of habitats and patches emerges from a hierarchy of decisions,
   whether resource consumption correlates closely with space use, and
   whether different types of individuals are associated with patterns of
   spatial distribution. I address these knowledge gaps with field
   experiments that manipulated the risk and quality of foraging patches
   exploited by male meadow voles. I used clear versus wooden covers to
   create risky versus safe foraging sites and added supplemental food to
   create rich versus poor habitats. I assessed whether the resources
   harvested from each tray matched its frequency of use by groups of voles
   expressing different temperament scores. Habitat and patch use did not
   fit a simple hierarchy of decisions because animals merged space use and
   foraging speed in a sophisticated strategy of risk management. Giving-up
   densities mirrored activity densities at the scale of safe versus risky
   patches but not at the scale of safe versus risky or rich versus poor
   habitats. Voles tended to prefer one habitat over another for reasons
   independent of the experimental manipulations. Groups of voles with
   different temperament scores were not linked to foraging types but were
   linked to habitat preference. The bias in habitat use by different
   behavioural types provides a potential mechanism for the evolutionary
   divergence of populations occupying different habitats.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{9-14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within animal groups may differ in personality and degree of
   familiarity raising the question of how this influences their social
   interactions. In Iberian magpies Cyanopica cooki, a portion of
   first-year males engage in cooperative behaviours and dispersal,
   allowing addressing this question. In this study, we first investigate
   the relationship between colony familiarity (native versus foreign) and
   reproductive status (breeding versus helping) of males during 21 years.
   Secondly, we measure the exploratory behaviour and monitor reproductive
   status of a sample of individuals with different colony familiarity
   during 2 years. Long-term monitoring revealed that foreign individuals
   were more likely breeders. The analysis on the subset of individuals in
   which exploratory behaviour was measured revealed a mediatory effect of
   exploratory behaviour in the association between colony familiarity and
   helping behaviour. Specifically, among foreign individuals, higher
   explorative males were more frequently involved in helping behaviour
   than lower explorative ones. Conversely, among native males, breeders
   were more explorative than helpers. Our results suggest that aspects of
   personality may mediate the value of familiarity in reproductive tasks
   in social species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific interactions form the cornerstone of niche theory in
   community ecology. The 7-year study In Focus here supports the view that
   variation within species could also be crucially important. Spider
   communities created experimentally in the wild, with either aggressive
   or docile individuals of the same founder species, were highly divergent
   in patterns of community succession for several years. Eventually, they
   converged on the same community composition only to collapse entirely
   shortly after, apparently because of the specific mix of aggression
   phenotypes within and between species just before collapse. These
   results suggest numerous avenues of research for behavioural ecology and
   evolutionary community ecology in metapopulations, and could help to
   resolve differences between competing theories.}},

Title = {{Emergence of Leadership within a Homogeneous Group}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Large scale coordination without dominant, consistent leadership is
   frequent in nature. How individuals emerge from within the group as
   leaders, however transitory this position may be, has become an
   increasingly common question asked. This question is further complicated
   by the fact that in many of these aggregations, differences between
   individuals are minor and the group is largely considered to be
   homogeneous. In the simulations presented here, we investigate the
   emergence of leadership in the extreme situation in which all
   individuals are initially identical. Using a mathematical model
   developed using observations of natural systems, we show that the
   addition of a simple concept of leadership tendencies which is inspired
   by observations of natural systems and is affected by experience can
   produce distinct leaders and followers using a nonlinear feedback loop.
   Most importantly, our results show that small differences in experience
   can promote the rapid emergence of stable roles for leaders and
   followers. Our findings have implications for our understanding of
   adaptive behaviors in initially homogeneous groups, the role experience
   can play in shaping leadership tendencies, and the use of
   self-assessment in adapting behavior and, ultimately,
   self-role-assignment.}},

Title = {{Examining the Role of Testosterone in Mediating Short-Term Aggressive
   Responses to Social Stimuli in a Lizard}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Hormones have been suggested as a key proximate mechanism that organize
   and maintain consistent individual differences in behavioural traits
   such as aggression. The steroid hormone testosterone in particular has
   an important activational role in mediating short-term aggressive
   responses to social and environmental stimuli within many vertebrate
   systems. We conducted two complementary experiments designed to
   investigate the activational relationship between testosterone and
   aggression in male Egernia whitii, a social lizard species. First, we
   investigated whether a conspecific aggressive challenge induced a
   testosterone response and second, we artificially manipulated
   testosterone concentrations to examine whether this changed aggression
   levels. We found that at the mean level, plasma T concentration did not
   appear to be influenced by an aggression challenge. However, there was a
   slight indication that receiving a challenge may influence
   intra-individual consistency of plasma T concentrations, with
   individuals not receiving an aggression challenge maintaining
   consistency in their circulating testosterone concentrations, while
   those individuals that received a challenge did not. Manipulating
   circulating testosterone concentrations had no influence on either
   mean-level or individual-level aggression. Combined with our previous
   work, our study adds increasing evidence that the relationship between
   testosterone and aggression is not straightforward, and promotes the
   investigation of alternative hormonal pathways and differences in
   neuro-synthesis and neuroendocrine pathways to account for species
   variable testosterone - aggression links.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{110-112}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Diversity of animal personalities has been proposed to arise from
   differences in social attraction, and to enhance behavioural flexibility
   of a population. The present study evaluated gregariousness as a
   personality trait in 14 ewes kept on pasture. Gregariousness was defined
   based on the frequency of having a close neighbour (<3 m). Highly
   gregarious (HG) and less gregarious (LG) animals were separated into two
   groups (n = 7) which were reintegrated after 18 days. During direct
   field observations, behaviour was recorded individually every 15 min.
   Each session lasted 2.5 h (08.30-11.00 h or 1430-17.00 h, respectively).
   Behavioural synchronization was highest when the group consisted only of
   HG individuals (K-HG = 0.69, K-LG =0.31; t=5.29; p <0.001), indicating
   that gregariousness predicted behavioural synchronization in sheep.
   Though sheep are generally recognized as a highly gregarious species, HG
   and LG individuals could be differentiated clearly and consistently.
   Research on animal personality might help explain social influences on
   behavioural synchronization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a review of individual differences in animal
   behavior exemplified by fishes. Main approaches to these differences
   investigation are outlined. Such terms as temperament can be used to
   describe consistent characteristics of individuality in animals. It
   should be emphasized that consistency over time and across situations is
   the main classification characteristic of the temperament trait. We also
   briefly review genetic and physiological mechanisms of individuality in
   fish, factors affecting their development in the ontogeny, and effects
   of the individual experience. Significant adaptive value of temperament
   is shown: in many cases the natural selection maintains alternative
   behavioral tactics. We also consider the main quantitative models
   accounting for the coexistence of individuals with different behavioral
   patterns. Finally, it is demonstrated that patterns of behavioral
   individuality may significantly affect population dynamics.}},
