Abstract = {{A behavioral syndrome is a suite of correlated behaviors expressed
   either within a given behavioral context (e.g., correlations between
   foraging behaviors in different habitats) or across different contexts
   (e.g., correlations among feeding, antipredator mating, aggressive, and
   dispersal behaviors). For example, some individuals (and genotypes)
   might be generally more aggressive, more active or bold, while others
   are generally less aggressive, active or bold. This phenomenon has been
   studied in detail in humans, some primates, laboratory rodents, and some
   domesticated animals, but has rarely been studied in other organisms,
   and rarely examined from an evolutionary or ecological perspective.
   Here, we present an integrative overview on the potential importance of
   behavioral syndromes in evolution and ecology. A central idea is that
   behavioral correlations generate tradeoffs; for example, an aggressive
   genotype might do well in situations where high aggression is favored,
   but might be inappropriately aggressive in situations where low
   aggression is favored (and vice versa for a low aggression genotype).
   Behavioral syndromes can thereby result in maladaptive behavior in some
   contexts, and potentially maintain individual variation in behavior in a
   variable environment. We suggest terminology and methods for studying
   behavioral syndromes, review examples, discuss evolutionary and
   proximate approaches for understanding behavioral syndromes, note
   insights from human personality research, and outline some potentially
   important ecological implications. Overall, we suggest that behavioral
   syndromes could play a useful role as an integrative bridge between
   genetics, experience, neuroendocrine mechanisms, evolution, and ecology.}},

Title = {{Repeatability for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data: a practical guide for

Abstract = {{Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the
   intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for
   quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of
   phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be
   attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a
   consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the
   sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several
   ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no
   formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for
   non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition
   to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors
   and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability
   estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the
   methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for
   Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three
   common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model
   (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on
   generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation
   of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We
   also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors,
   confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and
   recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests
   and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based
   approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables
   can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of
   repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in
   relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a
   collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate
   repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.}},

Abstract = {{The author explores the viability of a comparative approach to
   personality research. A review of the diverse animal-personality
   literature suggests that (a) most research uses trait constructs,
   focuses on variation within (vs. across) species, and uses either
   behavioral codings or trait ratings; (b) ratings are generally reliable
   and show some validity (7 parameters that could influence reliability
   and 4 challenges to validation are discussed); and (c) some dimensions
   emerge across species, but summaries are hindered by a lack of standard
   descriptors. Arguments for and against cross-species comparisons are
   discussed, and research guidelines are suggested. Finally, a research
   agenda guided by evolutionary and ecological principles is proposed. It
   is concluded that animal studies provide unique opportunities to examine
   biological, genetic, and environmental bases of personality and to study
   personality change, personality-health links, and personality
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are
   not only found in humans(1) but also in a wide range of other animal
   species(2-8). Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural
   tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the
   behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the
   evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more
   flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective
   advantage(9-11). Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as
   resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour(7)
   (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities
   can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the
   insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction(13)
   often results in polymorphic populations(14) in which some individuals
   put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history
   theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should
   result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour(15).
   Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should
   be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies
   to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently
   differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we
   demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal
   personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural
   types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of
   behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the
   common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like
   boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal
   personalities(2-8).}},

   (plasticity), and that these phenomena can be considered complementary

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis specifies that closely
   related species or populations experiencing different ecological
   conditions should differ in a suite of metabolic, hormonal and immunity
   traits that have coevolved with the life-history particularities related
   to these conditions. Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS
   concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for
   numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history
   traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the
   POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits
   between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that
   consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality,
   covary with life history and physiological differences at the
   within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss
   how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which personality studies
   can be integrated to address how variation in personality traits is
   maintained within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Personality differences are a widespread phenomenon throughout the
   animal kingdom. Past research has focused on the characterization of
   such differences and a quest for their proximate and ultimate causation.
   However, the consequences of these differences for ecology and evolution
   received much less attention. Here, we strive to fill this gap by
   providing a comprehensive inventory of the potential implications of
   personality differences, ranging from population growth and persistence
   to species interactions and community dynamics, and covering issues such
   as social evolution, the speed of evolution, evolvability, and
   speciation. The emerging picture strongly suggests that personality
   differences matter for ecological and evolutionary processes (and their
   interaction) and, thus, should be considered a key dimension of
   ecologically and evolutionarily relevant intraspecific variation.}},

Abstract = {{A perplexing new question that has emerged from the recent surge of
   interest in behavioural syndromes or animal personalities is - why do
   individual animals behave consistently when behavioural flexibility is
   advantageous? If individuals have a tendency to be generally aggressive,
   then a relatively aggressive individual might be overly aggressive
   towards offspring, mates or even predators. Despite these costs, studies
   in several taxa have shown that individuals that are more aggressive are
   also relatively bold. However, the behavioural correlation is not
   universal; even within a species, population comparisons have shown that
   boldness and aggressiveness are correlated in populations of
   sticklebacks that are under strong predation pressure, but not in low
   predation populations. Here, we provide the first demonstration that an
   environmental factor can induce a correlation between boldness and
   aggressiveness. Boldness under predation risk and aggressiveness towards
   a conspecific were measured before and after sticklebacks were exposed
   to predation by trout, which predated half the sticklebacks. Exposure to
   predation generated the boldness-aggressiveness behavioural correlation.
   The behavioural correlation was produced by both selection by predators
   and behavioural plasticity. These results support the hypothesis that
   certain correlations between behaviours might be adaptive in some
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate
   causation and its ecological and evolutionary significance, but have
   mostly ignored questions about its development, although an
   understanding of the latter is highly relevant to these other questions.
   One possible reason for this neglect is confusion about many of the
   concepts and terms that are necessary to study the development of animal
   personality. Here, we provide a framework for studying personality
   development that focuses on the properties of animal personality, and
   considers how and why these properties may change over time. We
   specifically focus on three dimensions of personality: (1) contextual
   generality at a given age or time, (2) temporal consistency in
   behavioural traits and in relationships between traits, and (3) the
   effects of genes and experience on the development of personality at a
   given age or life stage. We advocate using a new approach, contextual
   reaction norms, to study the contextual generality of personality traits
   at the level of groups, individuals and genotypes, show how concepts and
   terms borrowed from the literature on personality development in humans
   can be used to study temporal changes in personality at the level of
   groups and individuals, and demonstrate how classical developmental
   reaction norms can provide insights into the ways that genes and
   experiential factors interact across ontogeny to affect the expression
   of personality traits. In addition, we discuss how correlations between
   the effects of genes and experience on personality development can arise
   as a function of individuals' control over their own environment, via
   niche-picking or niche-construction. Using this framework, we discuss
   several widely held assumptions about animal personality development
   that still await validation, identify neglected methodological issues,
   and describe a number of promising new avenues for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific trait variation has long served as a conceptual foundation
   for our understanding of ecological patterns and dynamics. In
   particular, ecologists recognise the important role that animal
   behaviour plays in shaping ecological processes. An emerging area of
   interest in animal behaviour, the study of behavioural syndromes (animal
   personalities) considers how limited behavioural plasticity, as well as
   behavioural correlations affects an individuals fitness in diverse
   ecological contexts. In this article we explore how insights from the
   concept and study of behavioural syndromes provide fresh understanding
   of major issues in population ecology. We identify several general
   mechanisms for how population ecology phenomena can be influenced by a
   species or populations average behavioural type, by within-species
   variation in behavioural type, or by behavioural correlations across
   time or across ecological contexts. We note, in particular, the
   importance of behavioural type-dependent dispersal in spatial ecology.
   We then review recent literature and provide new syntheses for how these
   general mechanisms produce novel insights on five major issues in
   population ecology: (1) limits to species distribution and abundance;
   (2) species interactions; (3) population dynamics; (4) relative
   responses to human-induced rapid environmental change; and (5)

Pages = {{641-653}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we show how animal personality could explain some of the
   large inter-individual variation in resting metabolic rate (MR) and
   explore methodological and functional linkages between personality and
   energetics. Personality will introduce variability in resting MR
   measures because individuals consistently differ in their stress
   response, exploration or activity levels, all of which influence MR
   measurements made with respirometry and the doubly-labelled water
   technique. Physiologists try to exclude these behavioural influences
   from resting MR measurements, but animal personality research indicates
   that these attempts are unlikely to be successful. For example, because
   reactive animals ``freeze{''} when submitted to a stress, their MR could
   be classified as ``resting{''} because of immobility when in fact they
   are highly stressed with an elevated MR. More importantly, recent
   research demonstrating that behavioural responses to novel and highly
   artificial stimuli are correlated with both behaviour and fitness under
   more natural circumstances calls into question the wisdom of excluding
   these behavioural influences on MR measurements. The reason that
   intra-specific variation in resting MR are so weakly correlated with
   daily energy expenditure (DEE) and fitness, may be that the latter two
   measures fully incorporate personality while the former partially
   excludes its influence. Because activity, exploration, boldness and
   aggressiveness are energetically costly, personality and metabolism
   should be correlated and physiological constraints may underlie
   behavioural syndromes. We show how physiological ecologists can better
   examine behavioural linkages between personality and metabolism, as
   required to better understand the physiological correlates of
   personality and the evolutionary consequences of metabolic variability.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in proximate and ultimate causes and consequences of
   between- and within-individual variation in labile components of the
   phenotype such as behaviour or physiology characterizes current research
   in evolutionary ecology. The study of individual variation requires
   tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into

   components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We
   provide an overview of how mixed-effect models can be used to partition
   variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into
   between- and within-individual variance components. Optimal sampling
   schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of
   repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and
   within-individual correlations, are detailed. Mixed-effect models enable
   the usage of unambiguous terminology for patterns of biological
   variation that currently lack a formal statistical definition (e.g.
   animal personality or behavioural syndromes), and facilitate
   cross-fertilisation between disciplines such as behavioural ecology,

Abstract = {{Individual variation in behavior and physiology is a widespread and
   ecologically functional phenomenon in nature in virtually all vertebrate
   species. Due to domestication of laboratory animals, studies may suffer
   from a strong selection bias. This paper summarizes behavioral,
   neuroendocrine and neurobiological studies using the natural individual
   variation in rats and mice. Individual behavioral characteristics appear
   to be consistent over time and across situations. The individual
   variation has at least two dimensions in which the quality of the
   response to a challenging condition (coping style) is independent from
   the quantity of that response (stress reactivity). The neurobiology
   reveals important differences in the homeostatic control of the
   serotonergic neuron and the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in
   relation to coping style. It is argued that a careful exploitation of
   the broad natural and biologically functional individual variation in
   behavior and physiology may help in developing better animal models for
   understanding individual disease vulnerability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Recent progress has been made on the study of personality in animals,
   both from a mechanistic and a functional perspective. While we start
   knowing more about the proximal mechanisms responsible for the
   consistent differences in behaviour between individuals in a population,
   little is known yet about the relationship between the phenotypic
   distribution of personality traits, or combinations of traits, and
   fitness. Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the
   fitness consequences of personality traits in natural populations. We
   start by a description of two case studies that have examined the role
   of natural selection on personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great
   tit. Parus major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other
   studies that have reported some links between personality traits and
   fitness indices, in a large variety of animal species. We continue by
   outlining both direct approaches (i.e., measuring correlational
   selection on personality trait combinations) and indirect approaches
   (i.e., comparing correlations between personality traits within and
   between populations) to study suites of correlated traits from an
   adaptive perspective. This review, we hope, will be able to stimulate
   the use of the phenotypic selection analysis applied to the study of
   selection on personality traits in animals.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behavior are a widespread
   phenomenon in animals, but the proximate reasons for them are
   unresolved. We discuss evidence for the hypothesis that CIDs in energy
   metabolism, as reflected by resting metabolic rate (RMR), promote CIDs
   in behavior patterns that either provide net energy (e.g. foraging
   activity), and/or consume energy (e.g. courtship activity). In doing so,
   we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and
   life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a)
   related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c)
   correlated with behavioral output (e.g. aggressiveness) and productivity
   (e.g. growth). We conclude by discussing future research directions to
   clarify linkages between behavior and energy metabolism in this emerging

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1117-1129}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be
   considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to
   how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape
   structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the
   spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity
   or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes
   with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that
   has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is
   that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a
   crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing
   landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the
   short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing
   dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level,
   i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation
   affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration,
   displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed
   likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes
   in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs).
   Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between
   the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular
   landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity
   estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance
   algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian
   distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with
   respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and
   landscape information.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we review recent models that provide adaptive explanations
   for animal personalities: individual differences in behaviour (or suites
   of correlated behaviours) that are consistent over time or contexts. We
   start by briefly discussing patterns of variation in behaviour that have
   been documented in natural populations. In the main part of the paper we
   discuss models for personality differences that (i) explain animal
   personalities as adaptive behavioural responses to differences in state,
   (ii) investigate how feedbacks between state and behaviour can stabilize
   initial differences among individuals and (iii) provide adaptive
   explanations for animal personalities that are not based on state
   differences. Throughout, we focus on two basic questions. First, what is
   the basic conceptual idea underlying the model? Second, what are the key
   assumptions and predictions of the model? We conclude by discussing
   empirical features of personalities that have not yet been addressed by
   formal modelling. While this paper is primarily intended to guide
   empiricists through current adaptive theory, thereby stimulating
   empirical tests of these models, we hope it also inspires theoreticians
   to address aspects of personalities that have received little attention
   up to now.}},

Abstract = {{A coping style (also termed behavioural syndrome or personality) is
   defined as a correlated set of individual behavioural and physiological
   characteristics that is consistent over time and across situations. This
   relatively stable trait is a fundamental and adaptively significant
   phenomenon in the biology of a broad range of species, i.e. it confers
   differential fitness consequences under divergent environmental
   conditions. Behavioural flexibility appears to be an important
   underlying attribute or feature of the coping style that might explain
   consistency across situations. Proactive coping is characterized by low
   flexibility expressed as rather rigid, routine-like behavioural
   tendencies and reduced impulse control (behavioural inhibition) in
   operant conditioning paradigms. This article summarizes some of the
   evidence that individual differentiation in behavioural flexibility
   emerges as a function of underlying variability in the activation of a
   brain circuitry that includes the prefrontal cortex and its key
   neurochemical signalling pathways (e.g. dopaminergic and serotonergic
   input). We argue that the multidimensional nature of animal personality
   and the terminology used for the various dimensions should reflect the
   differential pattern of activation of the underlying neuronal network
   and the behavioural control function of its components. Accordingly,
   unravelling the molecular mechanisms that give rise to individual
   differences in the coping style will be an important topic in
   biobehavioural neurosciences, ecology and evolutionary biology.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a conceptual framework for the understanding of animal
   personalities in terms of adaptive evolution. We focus on two basic
   questions. First, why do behavioural types exhibit limited behavioural
   plasticity, that is, behavioural correlations both across contexts and
   over time? Second, how can multiple behavioural types coexist within a
   single population? We emphasize differences in `state' among individuals
   in combination with state-dependent behaviour. Some states are
   inherently stable and individual differences in such states can explain
   stable differences in suites of behaviour if it is adaptive to make
   behaviour in various contexts dependent on such states. Behavioural
   stability and cross-context correlations in behaviour are more difficult
   to explain if individual states are potentially more variable. In such
   cases stable personalities can result from state-dependent behaviour if
   state and behaviour mutually reinforce each other by feedback
   mechanisms. We discuss various evolutionary mechanisms for the
   maintenance of variation (in states and/or behaviour), including
   frequency-dependent selection, spatial variation with incomplete
   matching between habitat and phenotype, bet-hedging in a temporally
   fluctuating environment, and non-equilibrium dynamics. Although state
   differences are important, we also discuss how social conventions and
   social signalling can give rise to adaptive personality differences in
   the absence of state differences.}},

Abstract = {{This review examines the contribution of research on fishes to the
   growing field of behavioural syndromes. Current knowledge of behavioural
   syndromes in fishes is reviewed with respect to five main axes of animal
   personality: (1) shyness-boldness, (2) exploration-avoidance, (3)
   activity, (4) aggressiveness and (5) sociability. Compared with other
   taxa, research on fishes has played a leading role in describing the
   shy-bold personality axis and has made innovative contributions to the
   study of the sociability dimension by incorporating social network
   theory. Fishes are virtually the only major taxon in which behavioural
   correlations have been compared between populations. This research has
   guided the field in examining how variation in selection regime may
   shape personality. Recent research on fishes has also made important
   strides in understanding genetic and neuroendocrine bases for
   behavioural syndromes using approaches involving artificial selection,
   genetic mapping, candidate gene and functional genomics. This work has
   illustrated consistent individual variation in highly complex
   neuroendocrine and gene expression pathways. In contrast, relatively
   little work on fishes has examined the ontogenetic stability of
   behavioural syndromes or their fitness consequences. Finally, adopting a
   behavioural syndrome framework in fisheries management issues including
   artificial propagation, habitat restoration and invasive species, may
   promote restoration success. Few studies, however, have examined the
   ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes in the field. Knowledge of
   how behavioural syndromes play out in the wild will be crucial to
   incorporating such a framework into management practices.}},

   genetics is increasing. Studies on consistent individual differences in
   behavioural traits provide a good opportunity to do controlled
   experiments on the genetic mechanisms underlying the variation and
   covariation in complex behavioural traits. In this review we will
   highlight the contribution of genetic studies in animal personality
   research. We will start with reviewing the evidence that shows how much
   variation in animal personality traits is genetic, and connect this to
   knowledge from human personality studies. We will continue by
   considering the nature of that variation, its generation and
   maintenance. Finally we will point to further possibilities for studying
   the genetics of animal personalities. We will underline the importance
   of integrating both proximate and ultimate approaches when studying the
   evolution of animal personalities.}},

Abstract = {{With the exception of a few model species, individual differences in
   cognition remain relatively unstudied in non-human animals. One
   intriguing possibility is that variation in cognition is functionally
   related to variation in personality. Here, we review some examples and
   present hypotheses on relationships between personality (or behavioural
   syndromes) and individual differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses
   are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types
   (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive
   speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs,
   cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making,
   including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.
   Finally, we introduce the notion of cognition syndromes, and apply ideas
   from theories on adaptive behavioural syndromes to generate predictions
   on cognition syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) has been subjected to a huge range
   of selection pressures during domestication that has resulted in a
   considerable diversity in morphology and behaviour. This, together with
   the many uses the dog is put to in our society, makes the dog an
   interesting model for studies of animal personality. However, only a few
   attempts have been done to study individual differences in dogs. In this
   study, behavioural data from 15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds were
   used to investigate the existence of personality traits in dogs. The
   data were collected at a personality test that tested the dogs'
   reactions to strangers, ``fleeing{''} prey-like objects, and several
   potential fear- and aggression-eliciting stimuli. Factor analyses
   revealed the existence of five narrow traits: ``Playfulness{''},
   ``Curiosity/Fearlessness{''}, ``Chase-proneness{''}, ``Sociability{''}
   and ``Aggressiveness{''}. Higher-order factor analyses showed that all
   factors except ``Aggressiveness{''} were related to each other, creating
   a broad factor that influences behaviour in a range of situations. Both
   narrow and broad factors were found in a dataset including data from a
   large number of breeds, as well as within eight of Federation
   Cynologique Internationale's (FCI's) 10 breed groups. This indicates
   that the personality dimensions found in the study are general for the
   dog as a species. The finding of a major behavioural dimension in
   different groups of dog breeds, together with comparable results
   previously found for wolves (Canis lupus), suggests that the dimension
   is evolutionarily stable and has survived the varied selection pressures
   encountered during domestication. The broad factor is comparable to the
   shyness-boldness axis previously found in both humans and animals, and
   to human ``supertraits{''} (a combination of Extraversion and
   Neuroticism). The results of this study can be used to describe and
   compare individual dogs, as well as breeds. This, in turn, can be used
   in applications like selection of service dogs and breeding animals, as
   well as predicting behaviour problems in pet dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   puzzle that has recently generated considerable research interest.
   Although social factors are generally considered to be important, it is
   as yet unclear how they might select for personality. Drawing from
   ecological niche theory, we explore how social conflict and alternative
   social options can be key factors in the evolution and development of
   consistent individual differences in behaviour. We discuss how animal
   personality research might benefit from insights into the study of
   alternative tactics and illustrate how selection can favour behavioural
   diversification and consistency due to fitness benefits resulting from
   conflict reduction among social partners.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that an individual may be constrained, and even behave
   sub-optimally, because of its personality type has fundamental
   implications for understanding individual- to group-level processes.
   Despite recent interest in the study of animal personalities within
   behavioural ecology, the field is fraught with conceptual and
   methodological difficulties inherent in any young discipline. We review
   the current agreement of definitions and methods used in personality
   studies across taxa and systems, and find that current methods risk
   misclassifying traits. Fortunately, these problems have been faced
   before by other similar fields during their infancy, affording important
   opportunities to learn from past mistakes. We review the tools that were
   developed to overcome similar methodological problems in psychology.
   These tools emphasise the importance of attempting to measure animal
   personality traits using multiple tests and the care that needs to be
   taken when interpreting correlations between personality traits or their
   tests. Accordingly, we suggest an integrative theoretical framework that
   incorporates these tools to facilitate a robust and unified approach in
   the study of animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are common across taxa and have important
   evolutionary and ecological implications. Such consistent individual
   differences correlate with important life-history traits such as
   dispersal. Indeed, some environmental conditions are supposed to
   determine dispersers with a specific personality. For example, an
   increased density should promote the departure of individuals with less
   social tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that dispersers from
   high-density populations should primarily be asocial individuals,
   whereas dispersers from low-density populations should be social
   individuals. In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we measured
   attraction towards the odour of conspecifics on juveniles at birth as a
   metric of social tolerance. We then released these juveniles into
   populations of different densities and measured dispersal and settlement
   behaviours with regard to social tolerance. One year later, we again
   measured the social tolerance of surviving individuals. The social
   tolerance is constant across time and strongly reflects the individual's
   dispersal and settlement patterns with respect to population density.
   These results strongly suggest that social personalities exist and
   influence dispersal decisions. Further studies will help to elucidate
   the proximate and ultimate determinants of social personalities.}},

Abstract = {{The study of phenotypic evolution should be an integrative endeavor that
   combines different approaches and crosses disciplinary and phylogenetic
   boundaries to consider complex traits and organisms that historically
   have been studied in isolation from each other. Analyses of individual
   variation within populations can act to bridge studies focused at the
   levels of morphology, physiology, biochemistry, organismal performance,
   behavior, and life history. For example, the study of individual
   variation recently facilitated the integration of behavior into the
   concept of a pace-of-life syndrome and effectively linked the field of
   energetics with research on animal personality. Here, we illustrate how
   studies on the pace-of-life syndrome and the energetics of personality
   can be integrated within a physiology-performance-behavior-fitness
   paradigm that includes consideration of ecological context. We first
   introduce key concepts and definitions and then review the rapidly
   expanding literature on the links between energy metabolism and
   personality traits commonly studied in nonhuman animals ( activity,
   exploration, boldness, aggressiveness, sociability). We highlight some
   empirical literature involving mammals and squamates that demonstrates
   how emerging fields can develop in rather disparate ways because of
   historical accidents and/or particularities of different kinds of
   organisms. We then briefly discuss potentially interesting avenues for
   future conceptual and empirical research in relation to motivation,
   intraindividual variation, and mechanisms underlying trait correlations.
   The integration of performance traits within the pace-of-life-syndrome
   concept has the potential to fill a logical gap between the context
   dependency of selection and how energetics and personality are expected
   to interrelate. Studies of how performance abilities and/or aspects of
   Darwinian fitness relate to both metabolic rate and personality traits
   are particularly lacking.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term elevation of circulating glucocorticosteroids (GCs) in
   vertebrates facilitates the adoption of a distinct emergency life
   history state, which allows individuals to cope with perturbations and
   recover homeostasis at the expense of temporarily suppressing
   nonessential activities. Although GC responses are viewed as a major
   evolutionary mechanism to maximize fitness through stress management,
   phenotypic variability exists within animal populations, and it remains
   unclear whether interindividual differences in stress physiology can
   explain variance in unequivocal components of fitness. We show that the
   magnitude of the adrenocortical response to a standardized perturbation
   during development is negatively related to survival and recruitment in
   a wild population of long lived birds. Our results provide empirical
   evidence for a link between stress response, not exposure to stressors,
   and fitness in a vertebrate under natural conditions. Recent studies
   suggest that variability in the adrenocortical response to stress may be
   maintained if high and low GC responders represent alternative coping
   strategies, with differential adaptive value depending on environmental
   conditions. Increased fitness among low GC responders, having a
   proactive personality, is predicted under elevated population density
   and availability of food resources, conditions that characterize our
   study population.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often differ in what they do. This has been recognised since
   antiquity. Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary significance of
   such variation is attracting widespread interest, which is burgeoning to
   an extent that is fragmenting the literature. As a first attempt at
   synthesis, we focus on individual differences in behaviour within
   populations that exceed the day-to-day variation in individual behaviour
   (i.e. behavioural specialisation). Indeed, the factors promoting
   ecologically relevant behavioural specialisation within natural
   populations are likely to have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary
   consequences. We discuss such individual differences from three distinct
   perspectives: individual niche specialisations, the division of labour
   within insect societies and animal personality variation. In the
   process, while recognising that each area has its own unique
   motivations, we identify a number of opportunities for productive
   cross-fertilisation among the (largely independent) bodies of work. We
   conclude that a complete understanding of evolutionarily and
   ecologically relevant individual differences must specify how ecological
   interactions impact the basic biological process (e.g. Darwinian
   selection, development and information processing) that underpin the
   organismal features determining behavioural specialisations. Moreover,
   there is likely to be co-variation amongst behavioural specialisations.
   Thus, we sketch the key elements of a general framework for studying the
   evolutionary ecology of individual differences.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The qualitative assessment of animal behaviour summarizes the different
   aspects of an animal's dynamic style of interaction with the
   environment, using descriptors such as `confident', `nervous', `calm' or
   `excitable'. Scientists frequently use such terms in studies of animal
   personality and temperament, but, wary of anthropomorphism, are
   reluctant to do so in studies of animal welfare. We hypothesize that
   qualitative behaviour assessment, in describing behaviour as an
   expressive process, may have a stronger observational foundation than is
   currently recognized, and may be of use as an integrative welfare
   assessment tool. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the inter- and
   intraobserver reliability of spontanous qualitative assessments of pig,
   Sus scrofa, behaviour provided by nine naive observers. We used an
   experimental methodology called `free choice profiling' (FCP), which
   gives observers complete freedom to choose their own descriptive terms.
   Data were analysed with generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), a
   multivariate statistical technique associated with FCP. Observers
   achieved significant agreement in their assessments of pig behavioural
   expression in four separate tests, and could accurately repeat
   attributing expressive scores to individual pigs across these tests.
   Thus the spontaneous qualitative assessment of pig behaviour showed
   strong internal validity under our controlled experimental conditions.
   In conclusion we suggest that qualitative behaviour assessment reflects
   a `whole animal' level of organization, which may guide the
   intepretation of behavioural and physiological measurements in terms of
   an animal's overall welfare state. (C) 2001 The Association for the

   initial introduction stage. Here, we highlight how behavior influences
   the success or failure of unintentional species introductions across
   each stage of the introduction process, with a particular focus on
   transportation and initial establishment. In addition, we emphasize how

Abstract = {{Animal personality is now frequently reported in wild and captive

   squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben), and examined whether its
   variation could be maintained by changing selection pressures acting via
   reproductive traits and yearly variation in food abundance. There was no
   effect of personality on parturition date or litter size, but a female's
   activity was correlated to the growth rate of her offspring in the nest,
   and her aggressiveness was correlated to their survival in the nest and
   overwinter. The magnitude and direction of the effects changed among
   life history stages and years, possibly in association with food supply

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour, termed personality, are
   common in animal populations and can constrain their responses to
   ecological and environmental variation, such as temperature. Here, we
   show for the first time that normal within-daytime fluctuations in
   temperature of less than 3 degrees C have large effects on personality
   for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and
   manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three
   personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness,
   increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However,
   whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across
   temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the
   individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality.
   In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature
   contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended
   to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the
   importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying
   behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that
   individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal

Abstract = {{Individuals of many species differ consistently in their behavioral
   reaction to mild novel challenges. Suites of these behaviors are
   referred to as behavioral syndromes or personalities. Personality traits
   are often phenotypically and genetically correlated. Therefore, animal
   personalities are generally considered as broad characteristics, with
   one underlying genetical and physiological mechanism that is expressed
   across situations and contexts. Because there are carryover effects
   between situations, animals are not entirely flexible in their behavior
   in each situation. This may cause behaviors to seem nonadaptive in
   isolated situations. To test whether individuals with different
   personalities could react differently to changes in their environment,
   we Studied context dependence of personalities in the great tit (Parus
   major). We tested birds categorized as either fast or slow explorers for
   their latency to come back to a feeding table after a mild startle
   (risk-taking behavior) in a nonsocial followed by a social context. We
   found that the relation between exploratory behavior and risk-taking
   behavior depended on the social context. Females in general returned

   conspecific was dependent on their behavioral type. Slow males thereby
   reacted to the behavior of the companion and fast males did not. These
   results show that although personalities have a rigid structure the
   relation between personality traits is context dependent. These results
   are discussed in the perspective of the adaptive significance and
   maintenance of personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits are characterized by their labile expression:
   behavioural responses can, in principle, be up- and down-regulated in
   response to moment-to-moment changes in environmental conditions.
   Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population
   differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity.
   We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural
   plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic
   make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions
   natural selection might favour this form of between-individual
   variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the
   environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can
   promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how
   differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures
   induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual
   differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and
   evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We
   outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have
   knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can
   enhance the stability and persistence of populations. (c) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit behavioural syndromes-consistent individual
   differences in behaviour across two or more contexts or situations.
   Here, we present adaptive, state-dependent mathematical models for
   analysing issues about behavioural syndromes. We find that asset
   protection (where individuals with more `assets' tend be more cautious)
   and starvation avoidance, two state-dependent mechanisms, can explain
   short-term behavioural consistency, but not long-term stable behavioural
   types (BTs). These negative-feedback mechanisms tend to produce
   convergence in state and behaviour over time. In contrast, a
   positive-feedback mechanism, state-dependent safety (where individuals
   with higher energy reserves, size, condition or vigour are better at
   coping with predators), can explain stable differences in personality
   over the long term. The relative importance of negative-and
   positive-feedback mechanisms in governing behavioural consistency
   depends on environmental conditions (predation risk and resource
   availability). Behavioural syndromes emerge more readily in conditions
   of intermediate ecological favourability (e. g. medium risk and medium
   resources, or high risk and resources, or low risk and resources). Under
   these conditions, individuals with higher initial state maintain a
   tendency to be bolder than individuals that start with low initial
   state; i.e. later BT is determined by state during an early
   `developmental window'. In contrast, when conditions are highly
   favourable (low risk, high resources) or highly unfavourable (high risk,
   low resources), individuals converge to be all relatively bold or all
   relatively cautious, respectively. In those circumstances, initial
   differences in BT are not maintained over the long term, and there is no
   early developmental window where initial state governs later BT. The
   exact range of ecological conditions favouring behavioural syndromes
   depends also on the strength of state-dependent safety.}},

Abstract = {{Despite burgeoning interest in consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (animal `personality'), the influence of social interactions
   on the performance of different behavioural types is poorly understood.
   Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality
   differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the
   possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit
   personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received
   serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing
   selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch,
   we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration)
   between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts,
   the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex
   companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to
   behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of
   individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more
   exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory
   tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently
   across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though
   individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory
   behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion,
   the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of
   exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also
   affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results
   stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and
   of considering the influence of social context in animal personality
   studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of
   the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and
   evolutionary context. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{An exciting area in behavioural ecology focuses on understanding why
   animals exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behaviour
   (animal personalities). Animal personality has been proposed to emerge
   as an adaptation to individual differences in state variables, leading
   to the question of why individuals differ consistently in state. Recent
   theory emphasizes the role that positive feedbacks between state and
   behaviour can play in producing consistent among-individual covariance
   between state and behaviour, hence state-dependent personality. We
   review the role of feedbacks in recent models of adaptive personalities,
   and provide guidelines for empirical testing of model assumptions and
   predictions. We discuss the importance of the mediating effects of
   ecology on these feedbacks, and provide a roadmap for including
   state-behaviour feedbacks in behavioural ecology research.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental processes can have major impacts on the correlations in
   behaviour across contexts (contextual generality) and across time
   (temporal consistency) that are the hallmarks of animal personality.
   Personality can and does change: at any given age or life stage it is
   contingent upon a wide range of experiential factors that occurred
   earlier in life, from prior to conception through adulthood. We show how
   developmental reaction norms that describe the effects of prior
   experience on a given behaviour can be used to determine whether the
   effects of a given experience at a given age will affect contextual
   generality at a later age, and to illustrate how variation within
   individuals in developmental plasticity leads to variation in contextual
   generality across individuals as a function of experience. We also show
   why niche-picking and niche-construction, behavioural processes which
   allow individuals to affect their own developmental environment, can
   affect the contextual generality and the temporal consistency of
   personality. We conclude by discussing how an appreciation of
   developmental processes can alert behavioural ecologists studying animal
   personality to critical, untested assumptions that underlie their own
   research programmes, and outline situations in which a developmental
   perspective can improve studies of the functional significance and

Abstract = {{Animal personalities or behavioural syndromes are consistent and/or

   Social insect biologists have measured consistent individual variation
   in behaviour within and across colonies for decades. The goal of this
   review is to illustrate the ways in which both the study of social
   insects and of behavioural syndromes has overlapped, and to highlight
   ways in which both fields can move forward through the synergy of
   knowledge from each. Here we, (i) review work to date on behavioural
   syndromes (though not always referred to as such) in social insects, and
   discuss mechanisms and fitness effects of maintaining individual
   behavioural variation within and between colonies; (ii) summarise
   approaches and principles from studies of behavioural syndromes, such as
   trade-offs, feedback, and statistical methods developed specifically to
   study behavioural consistencies and correlations, and discuss how they
   might be applied specifically to the study of social insects; (iii)
   discuss how the study of social insects can enhance our understanding of
   behavioural syndromesresearch in behavioural syndromes is beginning to
   explore the role of sociality in maintaining or developing behavioural
   types, and work on social insects can provide new insights in this area;
   and (iv) suggest future directions for study, with an emphasis on
   examining behavioural types at multiple levels of organisation (genes,

   individuals has major implications for our understanding of ecological
   patterns and processes at scales from the level of the individual to the
   level of the population. Until recently, however, many studies that have
   considered the broader ecological implications of animal personality
   have failed to take into account the crucial moderating effect of social
   context. It is well documented that social processes, such as conformity
   and facilitation, exert considerable influence on the behaviour of
   grouping animals and hence that isolated individuals may often behave in
   a qualitatively as well as quantitatively different manner to those in
   groups. Recently, a number of studies have begun to address aspects of
   this gap in our knowledge and have provided vital insights. In this
   review we examine the state of our knowledge on the relationship between
   individual personality and sociality. In doing so we consider the
   influence of the social context on individual personality responses, the
   interaction between the collective personalities of group members and
   the expression of those personalities in the individual, and the
   influence of the personalities of group members on group structure and
   function. We propose key areas of focus for future studies in order to
   develop our understanding of this fundamentally important area.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of individual
   differences in animal personality (consistent individual differences in
   the same behaviour across time and contexts) are currently the subject
   of intense debate. A limited number of ecological factors have been
   investigated to date, with most attention focusing on the roles of
   resource competition and predation. We suggest here that parasitism may
   play a potentially important, but largely overlooked, role in the
   evolution of animal personalities. We identify two major routes by which
   parasites might influence the evolution of animal personality. First,
   because the risk of acquiring parasites can be influenced by an
   individual's behavioural type, local parasite regimes may impose
   selection on personality traits and behavioural syndromes (correlations
   between personality traits). Second, because parasite infections have
   consequences for aspects of host `state', parasites might induce the
   evolution of individual differences in certain types of host behaviour
   in populations with endemic infections. Also, because infection often
   leads to specific changes in axes of personality, parasite infections
   have the potential to decouple behavioural syndromes. Host-parasite
   systems therefore provide researchers with valuable tools to study
   personality variation and behavioural syndromes from a proximate and
   ultimate perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Partial migration, whereby only a fraction of the population migrates,
   is thought to be the most common type of migration in the animal
   kingdom, and can have important ecological and evolutionary
   consequences. Despite this, the factors that influence which individuals
   migrate and which remain resident are poorly understood. Recent work has
   shown that consistent individual differences in personality traits in
   animals can be ecologically important, but field studies integrating
   personality traits with migratory behaviour are extremely rare. In this
   study, we investigate the influence of individual boldness, an important
   personality trait, upon the migratory propensity of roach, a freshwater
   fish, over two consecutive migration seasons. We assay and individually
   tag 460 roach and show that boldness influences migratory propensity,
   with bold individuals being more likely to migrate than shy fish. Our
   data suggest that an extremely widespread personality trait in animals
   can have significant ecological consequences via influencing
   individual-level migratory behaviour.}},

Title = {{Measuring individual differences in reaction norms in field and
   experimental studies: a power analysis of random regression models}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{362-374}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Interest in measuring individual variation in reaction norms using
   mixed-effects and, more specifically, random regression models have
   grown apace in the last few years within evolution and ecology. However,
   these are data hungry methods, and little effort to date has been put
   into understanding how much and what kind of data we need to collect in
   order to apply these models usefully and reliably.
   2. We conducted simulations to address three central questions. First,
   what is the best sampling strategy to collect sufficient data to test
   for individual variation using random regression models? Second, on
   occasions when precision is difficult to assess, can we be confident
   that a failure to detect significant variance in plasticity using random
   regression represents a biological reality rather than a lack of
   statistical power? Finally, does the common practice of censoring
   individuals with one or few repeated measures improve or reduce power to
   estimate individual variation in random regressions?
   3. We have also developed a series of easy-to-use functions in the
   `pamm' statistical package for R, which is freely available, that will
   allow researchers to conduct similar power analyses tailored more
   specifically to their own data.
   4. Our results reveal potentially useful rules of thumb: large data sets
   (N > 200) are needed to evaluate the variance of individual-specific
   slopes; a number of individuals/number of observations per individual
   ratio of approximately 0.5 consistently yielded the highest power to
   detect random effects; individuals with one or few observations should
   not generally be censored as this reduces power to detect variance in
   plasticity.
   5. We discuss the wider implications of these simulations and remaining
   challenges and suggest a new way to standardize results that would
   better facilitate the comparison of findings across empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Many phenotypic traits show plasticity but behaviour is often considered
   the `most plastic' aspect of phenotype as it is likely to show the
   quickest response to temporal changes in conditions or `situation'.
   However, it has also been noted that constraints on sensory acuity,
   cognitive structure and physiological capacities place limits on
   behavioural plasticity. Such limits to plasticity may generate
   consistent differences in behaviour between individuals from the same
   population. It has recently been suggested that these consistent
   differences in individual behaviour may be adaptive and the term `animal
   personalities' has been used to describe them. In many cases, however, a
   degree of both behavioural plasticity and relative consistency is
   probable. To understand the possible functions of animal personalities,
   it is necessary to determine the relative strength of each tendency and
   this may be achieved by comparison of statistical effect sizes for tests
   of difference and concordance. Here, we describe a new statistical
   framework for making such comparisons and investigate cross-situational
   plasticity and consistency in the duration of startle responses in the
   European hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus, in the field and the
   laboratory. The effect sizes of tests for behavioural consistency were
   greater than for tests of behavioural plasticity, indicating for the
   first time the presence of animal personalities in a crustacean model.}},

Abstract = {{Although correlations have frequently been observed between specific
   physiological and behavioural traits across a range of animal taxa, the

   a major source of this inconsistency is the influence of environmental
   stressors, which seem capable of revealing, masking, or modulating
   covariation in physiological and behavioural traits. These effects
   appear to be mediated by changes in the observed variation of traits and
   differential sensitivity to stressors among phenotypes. Considering that
   wild animals routinely face a range of biotic and abiotic stressors,
   increased knowledge of these effects is imperative for understanding the
   causal mechanisms of a range of ecological phenomena and evolutionary
   responses to stressors associated with environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the ecological significance of personality, researchers
   generally measure behavioural traits in captivity. Whether behaviour in
   captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom
   tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild
   in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were
   briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and
   neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then
   released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an
   electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of
   feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery
   of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild.
   At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia
   in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was
   independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or
   weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual
   exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in
   captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all
   constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or
   the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in
   contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia
   measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured
   in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities,
   personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in
   foraging behaviour between individuals. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{How task specialization, individual task performance and within-group
   behavioural variation affects fitness is a longstanding and unresolved
   problem in our understanding of animal societies. In the temperate
   social spider, Anelosimus studiosus, colony members exhibit a
   behavioural polymorphism; females either exhibit an aggressive `asocial'
   or docile `social' phenotype. We assessed individual prey-capture
   success for both phenotypes, and the role of phenotypic composition on
   group-level prey-capture success for three prey size classes. We then
   estimated the effect of group phenotypic composition on fitness in a
   common garden, as inferred from individual egg-case masses. On average,
   asocial females were more successful than social females at capturing
   large prey, and colony-level prey-capture success was positively
   associated with the frequency of the asocial phenotype. Asocial colony
   members were also more likely to engage in prey-capture behaviour in
   group-foraging situations. Interestingly, our fitness estimates indicate
   females of both phenotypes experience increased fitness when occupying
   colonies containing unlike individuals. These results imply a reciprocal
   fitness benefit of within-colony behavioural variation, and perhaps
   division of labour in a spider society.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical work suggests that personality is a component of life
   history, but links between personality and either age-dependent
   reproductive success or life-history strategy are yet to be established.
   Using quantitative genetic analyses on a long-term pedigree we estimated
   indices of boldness and docility for 105 bighorn sheep rams (Ovis
   canadensis), born between 1983 and 1999, and compared these indices to
   their reproductive history from 2 years of age until death. Docility and
   boldness were highly heritable and negatively genetically correlated.
   Docile and bold rams survived longer than indocile and shy rams.
   Docility and boldness had a weak negative effect on reproductive success
   early in life, but a strong positive effect on older rams. Our findings
   highlight an important role of personality on reproductive success and
   suggest that personality could be an important component of life-history
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers with diverse interests in topics ranging from the formation
   of dominance hierarchies and social intelligence to animal personalities
   have predicted specific, and often conflicting, relations between social
   rank, neophobia and learning ability. We investigated the relations
   between these variables in captive groups of wild-caught starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, adopting a multidimensional approach to social rank
   and neophobia. Both agonistic and competitive rank orders were
   determined for each group and we tested individuals in the absence of
   their groupmates for object neophobia, latency to feed in a novel
   environment and performance on an extractive foraging task. In each
   starling group, the fastest learners occupied the highest competitive
   ranks, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive ability is positively
   correlated with social dominance. Competitive rank orders, however, did
   not correlate significantly with agonistic rank orders.
   Situation-specific foraging neophobia was suggested: individuals showed
   consistency in their latencies to feed near a variety of novel objects,
   but no significant correlation was found between this measure of object
   neophobia and latency to feed in a novel environment. Starlings fastest
   to feed in the novel environment were fastest in solving the foraging
   task. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers
   studying hierarchy formation in animal groups, social intelligence and
   animal personalities. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{rptR: repeatability estimation and variance decomposition by generalized

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{1. Intra-class correlations (ICC) and repeatabilities (R) are
   fundamental statistics for quantifying the reproducibility of
   measurements and for understanding the structure of biological
   variation. Linear mixed effects models offer a versatile framework for
   estimating ICC and R. However, while point estimation and significance
   testing by likelihood ratio tests is straightforward, the quantification
   of uncertainty is not as easily achieved.
   2. A further complication arises when the analysis is conducted on data
   with non-Gaussian distributions because the separation of the mean and
   the variance is less clear-cut for non-Gaussian than for Gaussian
   models. Nonetheless, there are solutions to approximate repeatability
   for the most widely used families of generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs).
   3.Here, we introduce the R package rptR for the estimation of ICC and R
   for Gaussian, binomial and Poisson-distributed data. Uncertainty in
   estimators is quantified by parametric bootstrapping and significance
   testing is implemented by likelihood ratio tests and through permutation
   of residuals. The package allows control for fixed effects and thus the
   estimation of adjusted repeatabilities (that remove fixed effect
   variance from the estimate) and enhanced agreement repeatabilities (that
   add fixed effect variance to the denominator). Furthermore,
   repeatability can be estimated from random-slope models. The package
   features convenient summary and plotting functions.
   4.Besides repeatabilities, the package also allows the quantification of
   coefficients of determination R-2 as well as of raw variance components.
   We present an example analysis to demonstrate the core features and
   discuss some of the limitations of rptR.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade there has been a profusion of studies highlighting
   covariation between individual differences in stress physiology and

   their adaptive value and evolutionary maintenance are the subject of
   debate. However, the precise way in which individual stress differences

Abstract = {{Prospect theory scholars have identified important human decision-making
   biases, but they have been conspicuously silent on the question of the

   consistent with prospect theory may have an origin in evolutionary
   psychology. Specifically, we derive a model from risk-sensitive optimal
   foraging theory to generate an explanation for the origin and function
   of context-dependent risk aversion and risk-seeking behavior. Although
   this model suggests that human cognitive architecture evolved to solve
   particular adaptive problems related to finding sufficient food
   resources to survive, we argue that this same architecture persists and
   is utilized in other survival-related decisions that are critical to
   understanding political outcomes. In particular, we identify important
   departures from standard results when we incorporate prospect theory
   into theories of spatial voting and legislator behavior, international
   bargaining and conflict, and economic development and reform.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphisms in several neurotransmitter-associated genes have been
   associated with variation in human personality traits. Among the more
   promising of such associations is that between the human dopamine
   receptor D4 gene (Drd4) variants and novelty-seeking behaviour. However,
   genetic epistasis, genotype environment interactions and confounding
   environmental factors all act to obscure genotype-personality
   relationships. Such problems can be addressed by measuring personality
   under standardized conditions and by selection experiments, with both
   approaches only feasible with non-human animals. Looking for similar
   Drd4 genotype-personality associations in a free-living bird, the great
   tit (Parus major), we detected 73 polymorphisms (66 SNPs, 7 indels) in
   the P. major Drd4 orthologue. Two of the P. major Drd4 gene
   polymorphisms were investigated for evidence of association with
   novelty-seeking behaviour: a coding region synonymous single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP830) and a 15 bp indel (ID15) located 50 to the
   putative transcription initiation site. Frequencies of the three Drd4
   SNP830 genotypes, but not the ID15 genotypes, differed significantly
   between two P. major lines selected over four generations for divergent
   levels of `early exploratory behaviour' (EEB). Strong corroborating
   evidence for the significance of this finding comes from the analysis of
   free-living, unselected birds where we found a significant association
   between SNP830 genotypes and differing mean EEB levels. These findings
   suggest that an association between Drd4 gene polymorphisms and animal
   personality variation predates the divergence of the avian and mammalian
   lineages. Furthermore, this work heralds the possibility of following
   microevolutionary changes in frequencies of behaviourally relevant Drd4
   polymorphisms within populations where natural selection acts
   differentially on different personality types.}},

Abstract = {{Dumpling squid, Euprymna tasmanica, show consistent individual
   differences in behaviour that can be classified according to indices
   reflecting shy-bold, activity and reactivity responses. Using crosses of
   wild-caught single males to multiple females with known behavioural
   phenotypes, this study estimated patterns of additive genetic and
   residual variance in these behavioural traits from offspring of squid in
   two contexts, a threat (antipredator) and feeding (foraging) test.
   Genetic contributions to behavioural expression were dependent on test
   context. Behaviours in antipredator contexts had significant
   heritabilities (h(2) = 0.2-0.8) while behaviours from foraging contexts
   had lesser additive genetic and greater residual components (h(2) =
   0.05-0.08). Personality trait variation in females was not related to
   her fecundity. Female boldness in foraging situations, which co-varied
   with body size, explained small but significant variation (similar to
   21\%) in brood hatching success, while successful fertilization was
   determined by positive assortion of mate pairs according to their
   shy-bold phenotype. These results are discussed in terms of the
   ecological and evolutionary significance of animal `personality' traits
   in wild populations of animals.}},

Abstract = {{Much research has been devoted to identify the conditions under which
   selection favours flexible individuals or genotypes that are able to
   modify their growth, development and behaviour in response to
   environmental cues, to unravel the mechanisms of plasticity and to
   explore its influence on patterns of diversity among individuals,
   populations and species. The consequences of developmental plasticity
   and phenotypic flexibility for the performance and ecological success of
   populations and species have attracted a comparatively limited but
   currently growing interest. Here, I re-emphasize that an increased
   understanding of the roles of plasticity in these contexts requires a
   `whole organism' (rather than `single trait') approach, taking into
   consideration that organisms are integrated complex phenotypes. I
   further argue that plasticity and genetic polymorphism should be
   analysed and discussed within a common framework. I summarize
   predictions from theory on how phenotypic variation stemming from
   developmental plasticity and phenotypic flexibility may affect different
   aspects of population-level performance. I argue that it is important to
   distinguish between effects associated with greater interindividual
   phenotypic variation resulting from plasticity, and effects mediated by
   variation among individuals in the capacity to express plasticity and
   flexibility as such. Finally, I claim that rigorous testing of
   predictions requires methods that allow for quantifying and comparing
   whole organism plasticity, as well as the ability to experimentally
   manipulate the level of and capacity for developmental plasticity and
   phenotypic flexibility independent of genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{There is great interest in environmental effects on the development and
   evolution of animal personality traits. An important component of an
   individual's environment is its social environment. However, few studies
   look beyond dyadic relationships and try to place the personality of
   individuals in the context of a social network. Social network analysis
   provides us with many new metrics to characterize the social
   fine-structure of populations and, therefore, with an opportunity to
   gain an understanding of the role that different personalities play in
   groups, communities and populations regarding information or disease
   transmission or in terms of cooperation and policing of social
   conflicts. The network position of an individual is largely a
   consequence of its interactive strategies. However, the network position
   can also shape an individual's experiences (especially in the case of
   juveniles) and therefore can influence the way in which it interacts
   with others in future. Finally, over evolutionary time, the social fine-
   structure of animal populations (as quantified by social network
   analysis) can have important consequences for the evolution of
   personalities-an approach that goes beyond the conventional
   game-theoretic analyses that assumed random mixing of individuals in
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that
   behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and
   context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among
   individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that
   some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship
   between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured
   several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese,
   Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of
   individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to
   an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a
   leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in
   pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability
   for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly
   correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity
   or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that
   leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality.
   Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected
   not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by
   the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that
   movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the
   personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement
   patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types
   present in the group. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{Trade-offs between behavioural traits promoting high life-history
   productivity and mortality may fuel the evolution of animal
   personalities. We propose that parasites, including pathogens, impose
   fitness costs comparable to those from predators, and influence the
   adaptiveness of personality traits associated with productivity (PAPs).
   Whether personality traits are adaptive or not may also depend on
   individual immunological capacity. We illustrate this using a conceptual
   example in which the optimal level of PAPs depends on predation,
   parasitism and host compensation (resistance and tolerance) of
   parasitism's negative effects. We assert that inherent differences in
   host immune function can produce positive feedback loops between
   resource intake and compensation of parasitism's costs, thereby
   providing variation underlying the evolution of stable personalities.
   Our approach acknowledges the condition dependence of immune function
   and co-evolutionary dynamics between hosts and parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Animals foraging in groups can either search for food themselves
   (producing) or search for the food discoveries of other individuals
   (scrounging). Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible
   but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different
   conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use
   in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and
   scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis),
   where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time
   in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate
   based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food
   patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the
   outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and
   their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining
   than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality
   is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold
   individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our
   results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural
   variation in models of producer-scrounger games.}},

Abstract = {{Animals often differ from one another in their willingness to take risks
   in a number of functional contexts related to fitness (e.g. mating,
   dispersal, and foraging behaviour). Although several studies have
   reported life history correlates and selective consequences of this
   variation in shy/bold behaviour, little attention has been paid to
   developmental processes resulting in shy/bold phenotypes. Here, we
   present a lifetime developmental study of shy/bold behaviour in dumpling
   squid, Euprymna tasmanica. Behaviour was measured in two test contexts,
   a threat and a feeding test, at five times across the entire life span.
   Across test contexts, shy/bold behaviour was not correlated at any age;
   while within a test context, individual shy/ bold phenotypes were
   consistent both before and after sexual maturity. During sexual
   maturity, different phenotypes displayed different amounts of
   developmental variation; shyer animals were more plastic in feeding
   tests, while bolder animals were more plastic in threat ones. Our
   results suggest that for some animals shy/bold behaviour throughout
   development is uncorrelated across different contexts related to risk,
   while within a context, there may still be developmental constraints to
   changing shy/bold behaviour. This constraint within a functional
   context, however, may be phenotype-specific, with some phenotypes able
   to change more than others. These results indicate that a greater
   understanding of developmental pathways is needed to determine whether
   shy/bold phenotypes per se are the sole focus of selection. Differences
   in developmental plasticity between shy/bold phenotypes may also confer
   differential fitness in fluctuating environments. (c) 2007 The

Abstract = {{The study of animal personality has attracted considerable attention, as
   it has revealed a number of similarities in personality between humans
   and several nonhuman species. At the same time the adaptive value and
   evolutionary maintenance of different personalities are the subject of
   debate. Since Pavlov's work on dogs, students of comparative cognition
   have been aware that animals display vast individual differences on
   cognitive tasks, and that these differences may not be entirely
   accounted for differences in cognitive abilities. Here, we argue that
   personality is an important source of variation that may affect
   cognitive performance and we hypothesise mutual influences between
   personality and cognition across an individual's lifespan. In
   particular, we suggest that: 1) personality profiles may be markers of
   different cognitive styles; 2) success or failure in cognitive tasks
   could affect different personalities differently; 3) ontogenetic changes
   of personality profiles could be reflected in changes in cognitive
   performance. The study of such interplay has implications in animal
   welfare as well as in neuroscience and in translational medicine

Abstract = {{Animal `personalities' or behavioural syndromes can be defined as
   individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours. Using
   chaffinches Fringilla coelebs temporarily held in captivity, we
   determined the extent to which activity level (AL), the behavioural
   response to a stressful situation (BRSS) and two anti-predation risk
   behaviours when exposed to a model predator were inter-correlated within
   individuals. We assayed AL and BRSS when the chaffinches were first put
   in an experimental room. Subsequently we recorded their initial response
   (freeze or escape) to the sudden appearance of a model hawk, in addition
   to their latency to resume activity afterwards as a measure of
   cautiousness ('latency'). Each bird was assayed in two situations that
   differed in the risk level posed and in the assumed optimal response
   required to minimize predation risk: (I) high risk, when the hawk flew
   directly over the chaffinch and the assumed optimal response was to
   escape; and (2) low risk, when the model hawk flew 2 m to the side of
   the chaffinch and, since the bird was not being targeted, the assumed
   optimal response was to freeze in order to avoid attracting attention.
   All of the variables had relatively high repeatabilities and were
   inter-correlated, providing strong evidence for a behavioural syndrome.
   Though propensity to freeze was much greater in the low risk treatment,
   AL was negatively correlated with freezing behaviour in both risk
   treatments, and therefore there was a `behavioural carryover' across
   situations. While hypoactive individuals were more likely to freeze in
   the low risk treatment, and were therefore assumed to be better able to
   assess risk compared to hyperactive individuals, some hypoactive
   individuals also froze in the high risk situation when it was assumed to
   be inappropriate to do so. Despite this apparently maladaptive behaviour
   in the high risk situation, overall hypoactive individuals showed a
   greater degree of behavioural plasticity across treatments compared to
   hyperactives. Taken together our results support the hypothesis of
   differential predation risk among personality types. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current interest in personalities, and
   for predation risk and group-living theories.}},

Title = {{Adaptive strategies for managing uncertainty may explain
   personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1009-1020}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that individuals within populations show
   consistent differences in their behaviour across contexts (personality),
   and that personality is associated with the extent to which individuals
   adjust their behaviour as function of changing conditions (behavioural
   plasticity). We propose an evolutionary explanation for a link between
   personality and plasticity based upon how individuals manage
   uncertainty. Individuals can employ three categories of tactics to
   manage uncertainty. They can 1) gather information (sample) to reduce
   uncertainty, 2) show strategic (state-dependent) preferences for options
   that differ in their associated variances in rewards (i.e.
   variance-sensitivity), or 3) invest in insurance to mitigate the
   consequences of uncertainty. We explicitly outline how individual
   differences in the use of any of these tactics can generate
   personality-related differences in behavioural plasticity. For example,
   sampling effort is likely to co-vary with individual activity and
   exploration behaviours, while simultaneously creating population
   variation in reactions to changes in environmental conditions.
   Individual differences in the use of insurance may be associated with
   differences in risk-taking behaviours, such as boldness in the face of
   predation, thereby influencing the degree of adaptive plasticity across
   individuals. Population variation in responsiveness to environmental
   changes may also reflect individual differences in variance-sensitivity,
   because stochastic change in the environment increases variances in
   rewards, which may both attract and benefit variance-prone individuals,
   but not variance-averse individuals. We review the existing evidence
   that individual variation in strategies for managing uncertainty exist,
   and describe how positive-feedbacks between sampling,
   variance-sensitivity and insurance can maintain and exaggerate even
   small initial differences between individuals in the relative use of
   these tactics. Given the pervasiveness of the problem of uncertainty,
   alternative strategies for managing uncertainty may provide a powerful
   explanation for consistent differences in behaviour and behavioural
   plasticity for a wide range of traits.}},

Abstract = {{The notion `quality of life' (QoL) suggests that welfare in animals
   encompasses more than just an absence of suffering, it concerns the
   quality of an animal's entire relationship with its environment, of how
   it lives its life. judgements of such quality are based on the
   integration of perceived details of how animals behave over time in
   different contexts. The scientific status of such judgements has long
   been ambiguous, but in recent decades has begun to be addressed by
   animal scientists. This paper starts with a brief review of qualitative
   approaches to the study of animal behaviour, which tend to address
   characteristics such as individuality, personality, and emotionality.
   The question then arises whether such characteristics involve a
   subjective, experiential aspect, and identify animals as sentient
   beings. The second half of this paper argues that taking the integrative
   nature of qualitative judgements seriously enables a `whole animal'
   perspective, through which it becomes possible to view behaviour as a
   dynamic, expressive body language that provides a basis for assessing
   the quality of an animal's experience (eg contented, anxious). judging
   this quality is a skill that requires knowledge of species-specific
   behaviour, experience in observing and interacting with animals in
   different contexts, and a willingness to communicate with animals as
   sentient beings. A substantial body of research indicates that this
   skill can function reliably in a scientific context, and can be applied
   usefully as a practical welfare assessment tool. Thus qualitative
   approaches to the study of animal behaviour should make an important
   contribution to the growing interest in animal QoL.}},

Abstract = {{Animals differ in their behaviour comparable to how humans differ in
   personality: individuals consistently differ in suites of correlated
   traits. Relationships between `personality traits' and fitness imply
   that personality traits can evolve by means of natural selection. We
   studied whether animal personality is also involved in sexual selection.
   We investigated whether exploratory behaviour (an aspect of animal
   personality, ranging from `slow' to `fast') correlated with the
   occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in broods of wild great tits. We
   expected that EPP rates should be highest for females mated with social
   partners of the same personality type (i. e. for slowe-slow or fast-fast
   pairs, but not other pair combinations). We found that the likelihood of
   EPP was highest for these pairs. Disassortative extrapair mating with
   respect to personality can be the consequence of several non-mutually
   exclusive processes. It might be caused by adaptive mate choice, which
   allows assortatively paired females to produce offspring with either
   more variable or more intermediate phenotypes, but it could also be the
   consequence of behavioural incompatibility between extreme behavioural
   phenotypes. Our findings indicate that personality differences play a
   role in the mechanism behind extrapair behaviours and we therefore
   conclude that it is now plausible that partner preference is based not
   only on morphological characteristics, but also on consistent
   behavioural traits or personality. (C) 2008 The Association for the

Abstract = {{In many animals, individual differences in behavior show remarkable
   consistency across situations and contexts (i.e., animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes). Studies on the association between personality
   traits and fitness-related measures in nature are, however, important to
   clarify the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. Here, we tested
   for correlations between 3 behavioral axes in brown trout ( Salmo
   trutta) parr: exploration tendency, behavioral flexibility, and
   aggressiveness. Next, we tested how these individual behaviors relate to
   social dominance and performance under natural conditions ( growth,
   survival, and movement). We found support for behavioral syndromes in
   brown trout with less explorative individuals being less aggressive and
   showing more flexible behavior. In addition, these low-explorative
   personality types grew faster than bolder conspecifics in the wild.
   Standardized aggression in the laboratory was a poor indicator of social
   dominance, and neither of these 2 traits affected performance in the
   wild. These results challenge the view that personality traits can be
   predicted by constant associations with life-history trade-offs (e.g.,
   boldness is linked with rapid growth). Moreover, our findings suggest
   that fitness predictions from laboratory measures of behavior should be
   made with caution and ideally tested in nature.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of personality implies individual differences in behavior
   and physiology that show some degree of repeatability/consistency over
   time and across contexts. Most studies of animal personality,
   particularly studies of individuals' variation in physiological
   mechanisms, have been conducted on selected individuals in controlled
   conditions. We attempted to detect consistent behaviors as well as
   physiological patterns in greylag ganders (Anser anser) from a
   free-roaming flock living in semi-natural conditions. We tested 10
   individuals repeatedly, in a handling trial, resembling tests for
   characterization of ``temperaments{''} in captive animals. We recorded
   the behavior of the same 10 individuals during four situations in the
   socially intact flock: (1) a ``low density feeding condition{''}, (2) a
   ``high density feeding condition{''}, (3) a ``low density post-feeding
   situation{''} and (4) while the geese rested. We collected fecal samples
   for determination of excreted immuno-reactive corticosterone (BM) and
   testosterone metabolites (TM) after handling trials, as well as the
   ``low density feeding{''} and the ``high density feeding{''} conditions.
   BM levels were very highly consistent over the repeats of handling
   trials, and the ``low density feeding condition{''} and tended to be
   consistent over the first two repeats of the ``high density feeding
   condition{''}. Also, BM responses tended to be consistent across
   contexts. Despite seasonal variation, there tended to be inter-test
   consistency of TM, which pointed to some individual differences in TM as
   well. Aggressiveness turned out to be a highly repeatable trait, which
   was consistent across social situations, and tended to correlate with an
   individual's resistance during handling trials. Also, ``proximity to the
   female partner{''} and ``sociability{''} - the average number of
   neighboring geese in a close distance while resting - were consistent.
   We conclude that aggressiveness, ``affiliative tendencies{''} and levels
   of excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites may be crucial
   factors of personality in geese. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   personality have conceptualized this general environmental sensitivity.
   Second, it reviews relevant previous human personality/temperament work,
   focusing on crossover interactions (where a trait generates positive or
   negative outcomes depending on the environment), and traits relevant to
   specific hypothesized aspects of SPS: inhibition of behavior,
   sensitivity to stimuli, depth of processing, and emotional/physiological
   reactivity. Third, it reviews support for the overall SPS model,
   focusing on development of the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) Scale as a
   measure of SPS then on neuroimaging and genetic studies using the scale,
   all of which bears on the extent to which SPS in humans corresponds to

Abstract = {{Individual common carp Cyprinus carpio were screened repeatedly for risk
   taking (rate of exploration of a novel, potentially dangerous
   environment) and for competitive ability (success in gaining access to a
   spatially restricted food source). Marked differences in behaviour were
   evident, and significant consistency in individual responses across
   trials was found for both risk taking and competitive ability. In
   addition, there was a significant positive relationship between
   individual performance in these two contexts, with fish that explored
   more quickly in the novel environment tending to be among the first to
   gain access to restricted food. In two follow-up studies, resting
   metabolic rate, blood lactate and glucose and the expression of the
   cortisol receptor gene in the head kidney and brain were compared in
   fish from the two extremes of the risk-taking spectrum. Mass-specific
   metabolic rate was significantly higher in risk-taking than in
   risk-avoiding fish, while plasma lactate and glucose concentrations and
   expression of the cortisol receptor gene were lower. It was concluded
   that a behavioural syndrome based on boldness and aggression exists in
   C. carpio, as it does in many other animals, and that this is associated
   with differences in metabolic and stress physiology (down to the genomic
   level) similar to those described in animals with different coping
   strategies. (C) 2010 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have explored various aspects of animal
   personality and their ecological consequences. However, the processes
   responsible for the maintenance of personality variability within a
   population are still largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that
   social personality traits exist in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara)
   and that the variation in sociability provides an explanation for
   variable dispersal responses within a given species. However, we need to
   know the fitness consequences of variation in sociability across
   environmental contexts in order to better understand the maintenance of
   such variation. In order to achieve this, we investigated the
   relationship between sociability and survival, body growth and
   fecundity, in one-year-old individuals in semi-natural populations with
   varying density. `Asocial' and `social' lizards displayed different
   fitness outcomes in populations of different densities. Asocial lizards
   survived better in low-density populations, while social females
   reproduced better. Spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions
   might thus be the process underlying the maintenance of these
   personality traits within a population. Finally, we also discuss the
   position of sociability in a more general individual behavioural pattern
   including boldness, exploration and aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding/predicting ecological invasions is an important challenge
   in modern ecology because of their immense economical and ecological
   costs. Recent studies have revealed that within-species variation in
   behaviour (i.e. animal personality) can shed light on the invasion
   process. The general hypothesis is that individuals' personality type
   may affect their colonization success, suggesting that some individuals
   might be better invaders than others. We have recently shown that, in
   the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), social personality trait
   was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial
   individuals dispersing further. Here, we tested how mean personality
   within a population, in addition to individual personality type, affect
   dispersal and settlement decisions in the mosquitofish. We found that
   individual dispersal tendencies were influenced by the population's mean
   boldness and sociability score. For example, individuals from
   populations with more asocial individuals or with more bold individuals
   are more likely to disperse regardless of their own personality type. We
   suggest that identifying behavioural traits facilitating invasions, even
   at the group level, can thus have direct applications in pest
   management.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of studies have shown that individuals differ
   consistently in a suite of correlated behavioural traits across various
   contexts and situations. Yet, most work on animal personalities has been
   performed under laboratory conditions and still little is known about
   the ecological significance of differences in personality in the wild,
   and the behavioural mechanisms underlying possible fitness consequences.
   In this study, we investigated individual differences in personality in
   relation to nest defence behaviour in wild great tits. Nest defence is
   an important aspect of parental care and involves a trade-off between
   two fitness components (i.e. survival and reproduction). As a measure of
   personality we used exploratory behaviour in a novel environment as this
   has been shown to be correlated with several other behavioural traits
   including risk-taking and aggression, two important behavioural
   components of nest defence. We found that the intensity of alarm calling
   towards a human intruder was positively associated with exploratory
   behaviour, while there was a negative association between exploration
   score and number of movements during nest defence. Thus, fast explorers
   are shown to respond more boldly towards predators in the field. More
   generally we show that individuals with different personalities vary in
   their anti-predator and reproductive investment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well established that individuals can differ consistently in
   their average levels of behaviour across different contexts. There have
   recently been calls to apply the same adaptive framework to
   interindividual differences in cognition. These calls have culminated in
   the suggestion that variation in personality and cognition should
   correlate. We suggest that both these appealing notions are conceptually
   and logistically problematic. We identify the first crucial step for
   establishing any cognition personality relationship. This is to
   determine the degree to which cognitive abilities yield consistent task
   performance. We then suggest how to establish whether such consistency
   exists. Finally, we discuss why formulating predictions about how
   cognition might be related to personality is much more difficult than is
   currently realised.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals frequently exhibit repeatable differences from other
   members of their population, differences now commonly referred to as
   `animal personality'. Personality differences can arise, for example,
   from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental
   and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic
   variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of
   behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and
   additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation
   in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect
   different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is
   possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when
   heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution
   of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated
   whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same
   data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that
   approximately 52\% of animal personality variation was attributable to
   additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is
   often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher.
   Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are
   likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and
   (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn
   from repeatability estimates may often be justified.}},

Abstract = {{Although behavioural plasticity should be an advantage in a varying
   world, there is increasing evidence for widespread stable individual
   differences in the behaviour of animals: that is, `personality'. Here we
   provide evidence suggesting that sexual selection is an important factor
   in the evolution of personality in species with biparental care. We
   carried out a cross-fostering breeding experiment on zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata, and found that parental personality traits and the
   combination of personalities within breeding pairs had positive effects
   on correlates of (foster) offspring fitness (body mass and condition).
   Furthermore, these nongenetic parental effects were pervasive and
   carried over into the next generation. Our results suggest that
   similarity in behavioural traits of biparental species can have
   important, long-lasting effects on reproductive success, probably
   because of reduced sexual conflict over the provision of parental
   investment. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Ecological invasions are a major worldwide problem exacting tremendous
   economic and ecological costs. Efforts to explain variability in
   invasion speed and impact by searching for combinations of ecological
   conditions and species traits associated with invasions have met with
   mixed success. We use a simulation model that integrates insights from
   life-history theory, animal personalities, network theory, and spatial
   ecology to derive a new mechanism for explaining variation in animal
   invasion success. We show that spread occurs most rapidly when (1) a
   species includes a mix of life-history or personality types that differ
   in density-dependent performance and dispersal tendencies, (2) the
   differences between types are of intermediate magnitude, and (3) patch
   connections are intermediate in number and widely spread. Within-species
   polymorphism in phenotype (e.g., life-history strategies or
   personality), a feature not included in previous models, is important
   for overcoming the fact that different traits are associated with
   success in different stages of the invasion process. Polymorphism in
   sociability (a personality type) increases the speed of the invasion
   front, since asocial individuals colonize empty patches and facilitate
   the local growth of social types that, in turn, induce faster dispersal
   by asocials at the invasion edge. The results hold implications for the
   prediction of invasion impacts and the classification of traits
   associated with invasiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The domestic dog has undergone extensive artificial selection resulting
   in an extreme diversity in body size, personality, life-history, and
   metabolic traits among breeds. Here we tested whether proactive
   personalities (high levels of activity, boldness, and aggression) are
   related to a fast ``pace of life{''} (high rates of growth, mortality,
   and energy expenditure). Data from the literature provide preliminary
   evidence that artificial selection on dogs (through domestication)
   generated variations in personality traits that are correlated with life
   histories and metabolism. We found that obedient (or docile, shy) breeds
   live longer than disobedient (or bold) ones and that aggressive breeds
   have higher energy needs than unaggressive ones. These correlations
   could result from either human preference for particular trait
   combinations or, more likely, correlated responses to artificial
   selection on personality. Our results suggest the existence of a general
   pace-of-life syndrome arising from the coevolution of personality,
   metabolic, and life-history traits.}},

   behavioural syndromes (Sih et al. 2004b, Quarterly Review of Biology,

   debate. Here, we present a very simple model of how adaptively managing
   noisy information, combined with differences in individual state, can
   lead to evolutionarily stable differences in how individuals respond to
   environmental cues. When information is very noisy, behavioural
   syndromes are most likely, but as long as there is some error, some
   types of individuals display the same behaviour in all contexts. In
   extreme cases, very few individuals display flexible behaviour, and
   different stable behavioural types dominate the population. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent individual differences across
   context and time, has attracted much recent research interest in the
   study of animal behaviour. More recently, this field has begun to
   examine how such variation arose and is maintained within populations.
   The habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, which posits that animals
   with differing personality types may fare better (i.e. have a fitness
   advantage) in different habitats, suggests one possible mechanism. In
   the current experiment, we tested whether slow-and fast-exploring
   black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), determined by
   performance in a novel environment exploration task, perform
   differentially when the demands of an acoustic operant discrimination
   (cognitive) task were altered following successful task acquisition. We
   found that slow-exploring birds learn to reverse previously learned
   natural category rules more quickly than faster exploring conspecifics.
   In accordance with the habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, and
   previous work with great tits (Parus major), a close relative of the
   black-capped chickadee, our results suggest that fast-exploring birds
   may perform better in stable, predictable environments where forming a
   routine is advantageous, while slow-exploring birds are favoured in
   unstable, unpredictable environments, where task demands often change.
   Our results also support a hypothesis derived from previous work with
   great tits; slow-exploring birds may be generally more flexible (i.e.
   able to modify their behaviour in accordance with changes in
   environmental stimuli) in some learning tasks.}},

   fearfulness, sociability and activity. Strong trade-offs, mutation
   selection balance, spatio-temporal fluctuations in selection, frequency
   dependence and good-genes mate choice are invoked to explain heritable
   personality variation, yet for continuous behavioural traits, it remains
   unclear which selective force is likely to maintain distinct
   polymorphisms. Using a model of trust and cooperation, we show how
   allowing individuals to monitor each other's cooperative tendencies, at
   a cost, can select for heritable polymorphisms in trustworthiness. This
   variation, in turn, favours costly `social awareness' in some
   individuals. Feedback of this sort can explain the individual
   differences in trust and trustworthiness so often documented by
   economists in experimental public goods games across a range of
   cultures. Our work adds to growing evidence that evolutionary game
   theorists can no longer afford to ignore the importance of real world
   inter-individual variation in their models.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness in animal personality studies is measured using a range of
   different behavioural assays, including responses to novel objects,
   novel environments and threatening stimuli. These assays should be
   correlated if they all reflect boldness, but this assumption has rarely
   been tested. We investigated experimentally whether presentation of
   threatening stimuli (a taxidermic puff adder, Bitis arietans arietans)
   and novel object (an unfamiliar food item) both assayed the same
   personality trait in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We recorded
   individual responses to both the snake model and novel foods for 57
   baboons encompassing all age-sex classes in two study troops over 3
   years. Surprisingly, those individuals that showed the greatest alarm
   responses to the model snake, that is, the least bold responses, also
   inspected it for longer. Furthermore, individuals' threat responses did
   not correlate with their response to the novel food. Thus, boldness
   according to one definition was not related to boldness using another
   definition. We suggest that threat-directed behaviours did not reflect
   individual boldness, but instead were indicative of another personality
   dimension: anxiety. These findings highlight that current boldness
   assays may not be interchangeable, and in some cases may not measure
   boldness at all. We stress the value of using multiple assays to measure
   the personality trait of interest. (C) 2012 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Personality is highly relevant to ecology and the evolution of fast-slow
   metabolic and life-history strategies. One of the most important
   personality traits is exploratory behaviour, usually measured on an
   animal introduced to a novel environment (e.g. open-field test).
   Here, we use a unique comparative dataset on open-field exploratory
   behaviour of muroid rodents to test a key assumption of a recent
   evolutionary model, i.e. that exploration thoroughness is positively
   correlated to age at first reproduction (AFR). We then examine how AFR
   and exploratory behaviour are related to basal metabolic rate (BMR).
   Inter-specific variation in exploratory behaviour was positively
   correlated with AFR. Both AFR and exploration behaviour were negatively
   correlated with BMR. These results remained significant when taking
   phylogeny into account.
   We suggest that species occupying unproductive and unpredictable
   environments simultaneously benefit from high exploration, low BMR and
   delayed AFR because exploration increases the likelihood of finding
   scarce resources, whereas low BMR and delayed reproduction enhance
   survival during frequent resources shortages.
   This study provides the first empirical evidence for a link between
   personality, life-history, phylogeny and energy metabolism at the
   inter-specific level. The superficial-thorough exploration continuum can
   be mapped along the fast-slow metabolic and life-history continua.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behavioral variation of 44 adult captive-born cheetahs,
   Acinoayx jubatus, was assessed using observer and keeper ratings on a
   variety of behavioral attributes. Inter-rater consensus was high for
   most questionnaire items, several of which were significantly correlated
   with direct behavioral measures recorded in a mirror-image experiment.
   Principal component analysis was applied to identify patterns of
   individual variation as measured by observer and keeper ratings. Three
   major components, labeled as tense-fearful, excitable-vocal, and
   aggressive, accounted for 69\% of the observed variation. Females showed
   significantly higher scores on the component tense-fearful than males.
   Non-breeders of both sexes scored significantly higher on the component
   tense-fearful than breeders. Assessment of individual behavioral
   variation through questionnaire ratings may therefore provide a simple
   and non-invasive tool for predicting an individual's ability to adjust
   to the constraints of certain husbandry regimens and to reproduce in

Abstract = {{Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated
   behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider
   correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and
   correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity,
   neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy),
   in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent
   personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this
   gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly
   repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of
   them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome.
   Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive
   individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that
   personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing
   within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of
   the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take
   several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual
   personality. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{P>The use of social information is known to affect various important
   aspects of an individual's ecology, such as foraging, dispersal and
   space use and is generally assumed to be entirely flexible and context
   dependent. However, the potential link between personality differences
   and social information use has received little attention. In this study,
   we studied whether use of social information was related to personality,
   using barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, where boldness is a personality
   trait known to be consistent over time. We found that the use of social
   information decreased with increasing boldness score of the individuals.
   Individuals had lower feeding times when they did not follow the social
   information and this effect was unrelated to boldness score. When
   manipulating social information, thereby making it incorrect,
   individuals irrespective of their boldness score, learned that it was
   incorrect and ignored it. Our results show that social information use
   depends on the personality type of an individual, which calls for
   incorporation of these personality-related differences in studies of
   spatial distribution of animals in which social information use plays a
   role.}},

Abstract = {{Research on behavioural syndromes (consistent individual differences in
   suites of correlated behaviours) requires formal statistical methods to
   describe and compare syndrome structures. We detail the shortcomings of
   current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes,
   such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis
   (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework
   involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation
   matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific
   hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural
   syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances
   across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their
   unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these
   methods using an already published data set for two groups of
   populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living
   in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a
   lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the
   absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of
   how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that
   the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance
   patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered
   environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and
   activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on
   conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline
   here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of
   behavioural syndromes within and between populations. (C) 2009 The

Abstract = {{Personality differences (i.e. consistent between-individual differences
   in behaviour) play an important role in the lives of humans and other
   animals, influencing both their day-to-day actions and their long-term
   reproductive success. For organisms living in highly structured groups
   of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects,
   personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while
   numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality,
   the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received
   little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective
   personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the
   presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of
   collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level
   personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed
   consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response,
   foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were
   correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these
   traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival.
   Our results show that the concept of collective personality is
   applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality
   differences among colonies can have important consequences for their
   long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality
   to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the
   structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role
   that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the
   evolution of behaviour. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Individual variation in exploratory behaviour has been demonstrated in a

   different exploration styles exhibited by black-capped chickadees
   (Poecile atticapillus) in a novel environment are related to how quickly
   these birds learn an acoustic discrimination task. We found that birds
   that readily enter a novel environment learn an acoustic discrimination
   task faster than birds that do not readily enter a novel environment.
   This result contrasts with previous work suggesting no correlation

Abstract = {{Human-altered environmental conditions affect many species at the global
   scale. An extreme form of anthropogenic alteration is the existence and
   rapid increase of urban areas. A key question, then, is how species cope
   with urbanization. It has been suggested that rural and urban
   conspecifics show differences in behaviour and personality. However, (i)
   a generalization of this phenomenon has never been made; and (ii) it is
   still unclear whether differences in personality traits between rural
   and urban conspecifics are the result of phenotypic plasticity or of
   intrinsic differences. In a literature review, we show that behavioural
   differences between rural and urban conspecifics are common and
   taxonomically widespread among animals, suggesting a significant
   ecological impact of urbanization on animal behaviour. In order to gain
   insight into the mechanisms leading to behavioural differences in urban
   individuals, we hand-raised and kept European blackbirds (Turdus merula)
   from a rural and a nearby urban area under common-garden conditions.
   Using these birds, we investigated individual variation in two
   behavioural responses to the presence of novel objects: approach to an
   object in a familiar area (here defined as neophilia), and avoidance of
   an object in a familiar foraging context (defined as neophobia).
   Neophilic and neophobic behaviours were mildly correlated and repeatable
   even across a time period of one year, indicating stable individual
   behavioural strategies. Blackbirds from the urban population were more
   neophobic and seasonally less neophilic than blackbirds from the nearby
   rural area. These intrinsic differences in personality traits are likely
   the result of microevolutionary changes, although we cannot fully
   exclude early developmental influences.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often show consistent behavioural differences where

   Behavioural traits of trout were scored before and after a 2-month
   interval covering a major survival bottleneck, whereupon the consistency
   and covariance of behaviours were analysed. We found that selection
   favoured individuals with high activity levels in an open-field context,
   a personality trait consistent throughout the duration of the
   experiment. In addition, a behavioural syndrome emerged over the 2
   months in the wild, linking activity to aggressiveness and exploration
   tendency. These novel results suggest that behavioural syndromes can
   emerge rapidly in nature from interaction between natural selection and

Abstract = {{The concept of behavioural syndromes hypothesizes that consistent
   behaviours across various situations mediate important life history
   trade-offs, and predicts correlations among behavioural traits. We
   studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological
   situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object,
   aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared
   flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the
   birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals.
   Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration,
   aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships
   varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability.
   Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap
   than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped
   birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful
   capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between
   behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample
   of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality,
   male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural
   responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by
   individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative
   behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for
   reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important
   implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that
   capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population. (C)

Abstract = {{This is the first part of a multi-zoo study to analyze the effects of
   captive environments on black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) behavior,
   breeding success, and well-being. We estimated the reliability and
   validity of a standardized method of cross-institutional assessment of
   the behavior of individual rhinoceros. In 1994 and 1995, we asked
   zookeepers at 19 toes to rate their black rhinoceros (a total of 60
   animals) on 52 behavior elements using a questionnaire. At 14 toes, at
   least two keepers rated all the black rhinoceros at their zoo. We used
   average differences in their ratings of the 52 behavior elements to
   determine the most reliably rated behavior elements. Fourteen elements
   were retained for further analysis. Based on their inter-correlations,
   we grouped these 14 behaviors into six behavior traits: olfactory
   behaviors, chasing/stereotypy/mouthing, friendly to keeper fearful,
   patrolling and dominant (to conspecifics). A behavior profile of each
   animal consisted of scores on these six traits that were the sum of the
   primary keeper's ratings for each element in the group. To test the
   validity of these profiles, we compared scores on the six traits to the
   behavior of each rhinoceros during a standardized test of reactivity to
   a novel object and a novel conspecific scent. Tests were videotaped and
   analyzed by one researcher. Frequencies and durations of behaviors
   observed during the tests were correlated with scores on all six rated
   behavior traits. Scores on friendly to keeper, dominant, and olfactory
   behaviors described differences between black rhinoceros of captive/wild
   caught origin, age,and sex, respectively. Among successfully breeding
   males, scores on dominant and olfactory behaviors were negatively
   correlated with reproductive success, as was chasing/stereotypy/mouthing
   for females. To test the repeatability of these results, during
   1996-1997, we used a modified questionnaire to re-survey 70 black
   rhinoceros at 24 toes. Results of the second survey were also similar to
   those of the first with respect to the behaviors that distinguish
   rhinoceros of different origin, age, sex, and reproductive success. We
   conclude that ratings by keepers of behavior and temperament attributes
   can be used as reliable and valid cross-institutional descriptions of
   individual differences between black rhinoceros. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Recent research focuses on animal personalities, that is individual
   differences in behaviour that are consistent across contexts and over
   time. From an adaptive perspective, such limited behavioural plasticity
   is surprising, since a more flexible structure of behaviour should
   provide a selective advantage. Here, we argue that consistency can be
   advantageous because it makes individuals predictable. Predictability,
   however, can only be advantageous if at least some individuals in the
   population respond to individual differences. Consequently, the
   evolution of consistency and responsiveness are mutually dependent. We
   present a general analysis of this coevolutionary feedback for scenarios
   that can be represented as matrix games with two pure strategies (e. g.
   hawk-dove game, snowdrift game). We first show that responsive
   strategies are favoured whenever some individual differences are present
   in the population (e. g. due to mutation and drift). We then show that
   the presence of responsive individuals can trigger a coevolutionary
   process between responsiveness and consistency that gives rise to
   populations in which responsive individuals coexist with unresponsive
   individuals who show high levels of adaptive consistency in their
   behaviour. Next to providing an adaptive explanation for consistency,
   our results also link two key features associated with personalities,
   individual differences in responsiveness and behavioural consistency.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of an animal group can impact greatly on the survival
   and success of its individual members. Much recent work has concentrated
   on behavioral variation within animal populations along the bold/shy
   continuum. Here, we screened individual guppies, Poecilia reticulata,
   for boldness using an overhead fright stimulus. We created groups
   consisting of 4 bold individuals (bold shoals), 4 shy individuals (shy
   shoals), or 2 bold and 2 shy individuals (mixed shoals). The performance
   of these different shoal types was then tested in a novel foraging
   scenario. We found that both bold and mixed shoals approached a novel
   feeder in less time than shy shoals. Interestingly, we found that more
   fish from mixed shoals fed than in either bold or shy shoals. We suggest
   that this can be explained by the fact that nearly all the cases where
   one fish was followed into the feeder by another occurred within mixed
   shoals and that it was almost always a shy fish following a bold one.
   These results suggest clear foraging benefits to shy individuals through
   associating with bold ones. Surprisingly, our results also suggest
   potential foraging benefits to bold individuals through associating with
   shy individuals. This study highlights a possible mechanism by which
   interindividual variation in behavioral types is maintained in a
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent and heritable individual differences in reaction to
   challenges, often referred to as stress coping styles, have been
   extensively documented invertebrates. In fish, selection for divergent
   post-stress plasma Cortisol levels in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) has yielded a low (LR) and a high responsive (HR) strain. A
   suite of behavioural traits is associated with this physiological
   difference, with LR (proactive) fish feeding more rapidly after transfer
   to a new environment and being socially dominant over HR (reactive)
   fish. Following transport from the UK to Norway, a switch in behavioural
   profile occurred in trout from the 3rd generation: HR fish regained
   feeding sooner than LR fish in a novel environment and became dominant
   in size-matched HR-LR pairs. One year after transport, HR fish still fed
   sooner, but no difference in social dominance was found. Among offspring
   of transported fish, no differences in feeding were observed, but as in
   pre-transported 3rd generation fish, HR fish lost fights for social
   dominance against size-matched LR opponents. Transported fish and their
   offspring retained their distinctive physiological profile throughout
   the study; HR fish showed consistently higher post-stress cortisol
   levels at all sampling points. Altered risk-taking and social dominance
   immediately after transport may be explained by the fact that HR fish
   lost more body mass during transport than did LR fish. These data
   demonstrate that some behavioural components of stress coping styles can
   be modified by experience, whereas behavioural plasticity is limited by
   genetic effects determining social position early in life story. (C)

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{806-811}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Behaviors are commonly correlated between individuals in so-called
   behavioral syndromes. Between-individual correlations of phenotypic
   traits can change the trajectories of evolutionary responses available
   to populations and even prevent evolutionary change if underpinned by
   genetic correlations. Whether behavioral syndromes also influence the
   course of evolution in this manner remains unknown. Here, we provide the
   first test of the degree to which evolutionary responses might be
   affected by behavioral syndrome structure. This test, based on a
   meta-analysis of additive genetic variancecovariance matrices, shows
   that behavioral syndromes constrain potential evolutionary responses by
   an average of 33\%. For comparison, correlations between life-history or
   between morphological traits suggest constraints of 1318\%. This finding
   demonstrates that behavioral syndromes might substantially constrain the
   evolutionary trajectories available to populations, prompts novel future
   directions for the study of behavioral syndromes, emphasizes the
   importance of viewing syndrome research from an evolutionary
   perspective, and provides a bridge between syndrome research and
   theoretical quantitative genetics.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) have been related
   to individual variation in novelty-seeking or exploratory behaviour in a
   variety of animals, including humans. Recently, the human DRD4
   orthologue was sequenced in a wild bird, the great tit (Parus major) and
   a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene (SNP830) was
   shown to be associated with variation in exploratory behaviour of
   lab-raised individuals originating from a single wild population. Here
   we test the generality of this finding in a large sample of free-living
   individuals from four European great tit populations, including the
   originally sampled population. We demonstrate that the association
   between SNP830 genotype and exploratory behaviour also exists in
   free-living birds from the original population. However, in the other
   three populations we found only limited evidence for an association: in
   two populations the association appeared absent; while in one there was
   a nonsignificant tendency. We could not confirm a previously
   demonstrated interaction with another DRD4 polymorphism, a 15 bp indel
   in the promoter region (ID15). As yet unknown differences in genetic or
   environmental background could explain why the same genetic polymorphism
   (SNP830) has a substantial effect on exploratory behaviour in one
   population, explaining 4.5-5.8\% of the total variance-a large effect
   for a single gene influencing a complex behavioural trait-but not in
   three others. The confirmation of an association between SNP830 genotype
   and personality-related behaviour in a wild bird population warrants
   further research into potential fitness effects of the polymorphism,
   while also the population differences in the strength of the association
   deserve further investigation. Another important future challenge is the
   identification of additional loci influencing avian personality traits
   in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{The proximate and ultimate explanations for behavioural syndromes
   (correlated behaviours - a population trait) are poorly understood, and
   the evolution of behavioural types (configuration of behaviours - an
   individual trait) has been rarely studied. We investigated population
   divergence in behavioural syndromes and types using individually reared,
   completely predator- or conspecific-naive adult nine-spined sticklebacks
   (Pungitius pungitius) from two marine and two predatory fish free,
   isolated pond populations. We found little evidence for the existence of
   behavioural syndromes, but population divergence in behavioural types
   was profound: individuals from ponds were quicker in feeding, bolder and
   more aggressive than individuals from marine environments. Our data
   reject the hypothesis that behavioural syndromes exist as a result of
   genetic correlations between behavioural traits, and support the
   contention that different behavioural types can be predominant in
   populations differing in predation pressure, most probably as a result
   of repeated independent evolution of separate behavioural traits.}},

Abstract = {{Fish have proven to be model organisms for the study of animal
   personalities, and a rich literature documents consistent
   interindividual behavioral differences in a variety of species. However,
   relatively few studies have examined the ecological consequences of such
   consistent interindividual differences in behaviors in fish or other
   organisms, especially under field conditions. In this review and
   perspective, we discuss the factors that may lead to the formation and
   maintenance of behavioral types in fish populations. We then examine
   what is known about the effects of personality variation on individual
   growth and survival, breeding behaviors and reproductive success,
   habitat use, diet, and ontogenetic niche shifts, migration and
   dispersal, as well as potential consequences for species interactions
   and ecosystem functioning. We focus as much as possible on studies
   conducted under natural or seminatural conditions, as such field studies
   are most relevant to elucidating the ecological consequences of
   behavioral variation. Finally, we discuss the potential importance of
   consistent individual differences in behaviors to fisheries management
   and conservation, specifically examining consequences for recreational
   and commercial fishing, hatchery rearing, and stock enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{We aim to stimulate an ontogenetic approach to personalities. We explain
   the importance of studying development for understanding proximate and
   ultimate aspects of personality and critically discuss, partly by
   perhaps provocative statements, our current lack of knowledge and
   potential approaches to the study of personality development. We first
   clarify some terminology and argue for a difference between behavioral
   profiles (BP; at the descriptive level) and personality ( at the
   explanatory level). We then focus on the issue of temporal stability of
   personality, arguing that based on evolutionary theory,
   neurophysiological knowledge, and recent findings, personality is
   probably less stable than often thought. Next we consider the potential
   influence of genes, discussing gene by environment correlations and
   interactions and argue that developmental changes in the regulation of
   DNA expression are probably more relevant than individual differences in
   DNA sequence. We end by suggesting perspectives for future research. (C)

Abstract = {{Within animal populations, genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors
   interact to shape individual neuroendocrine and behavioural profiles,
   conferring variable vulnerability to stress and disease. It remains
   debated how alternative behavioural syndromes and stress coping styles
   evolve and are maintained by natural selection. Here we show that
   individual variation in stress responsiveness is reflected in the visual
   appearance of two species of teleost fish; rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
   mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Salmon and trout skin vary
   from nearly immaculate to densely spotted, with black spots formed by
   eumelanin-producing chromatophores. In rainbow trout, selection for
   divergent hypothalamus-pituitary interrenal responsiveness has led to a
   change in dermal pigmentation patterns, with low cortisol-responsive
   fish being consistently more spotted. In an aquaculture population of
   Atlantic salmon individuals with more spots showed a reduced
   physiological and behavioural response to stress. Taken together, these
   data demonstrate a heritable behavioural-physiological and morphological
   trait correlation that may be specific to alternative coping styles.
   This observation may illuminate the evolution of contrasting coping
   styles and behavioural syndromes, as occurrence of phenotypes in
   different environments and their response to selective pressures can be
   precisely and easily recorded. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The fitness consequences of animal personalities (also known as
   behavioural syndromes) have recently been studied in several solitary
   species. However, the adaptive significance of collective personalities
   in social insects and especially of behavioural variation among group
   members remains largely unexplored. Although intracolonial behavioural
   variation is an important component of division of labour, and as such a
   key feature for the success of societies, empirical links between
   behavioural variation and fitness are scarce. We investigated
   aggression, exploration and brood care behaviour in Temnothorax
   longispinosus ant colonies. We focused on two distinct aspects:
   intercolonial variability and its consistency across time and contexts,
   and intracolonial variability and its influence on productivity.
   Aggressiveness was consistent over four to five months with a new
   generation of workers emerging in between trial series. Other behaviours
   were not consistent over time. Exploration of novel environments
   responded to the sequence of assays: colonies were faster in discovering
   when workers previously encountered opponents in aggression experiments.
   Suites of correlated behaviours (e. g. aggression-exploration syndrome)
   present in the first series did not persist over time. Finally, colonies
   with more intracolonial behavioural variation in brood care and
   exploration of novel objects were more productive under standardized
   conditions than colonies with less variation.}},

Abstract = {{Animals constantly need to cope with changes in their environment.
   Coping with changes in cues that are associated with the location and
   abundance of food is essential for being able to adjust behaviourally to
   a variable environment. The use of cues in decision making requires
   appropriate levels of attention and learning ability, which may be
   affected by the personality of an individual. The relationship between
   personality, attention and learning as essential mechanisms for
   behavioural adaptation, however, is not well understood. We studied the
   relationship between attention to environmental cues, behavioural
   flexibility in learning and exploratory behaviour, a proxy for
   personality, in great tits, Parus major. We used a dimensional shift
   learning paradigm; a learning task involving several stages differing in
   complexity and requiring attention to changes in relevant cues. The
   results show personality differences in performance in learning
   flexibility in only the apparently most difficult stage, yet in opposite
   directions for males and females. Fast-exploring males showed more
   flexible learning abilities than slow males, whereas in females slow
   explorers outperformed fast explorers. These context-dependent and
   sex-specific personality effects reveal behavioural and cognitive
   mechanisms that may underlie observed sex-and personality-dependent
   fitness differences in natural populations. (C) 2011 The Association for

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{450-456}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. According to a recent hypothesis, personality traits should form
   integrative pace-of-life syndromes with life-history traits. Potential
   life-history traits that explain personality variation are immune
   defence and growth rate.
   2. We studied whether boldness, measured as hiding behaviour, is
   repeatable during ontogeny in the field cricket, Gryllus integer, and if
   it relates to the efficiency of immune function (i. e. the capacity to
   encapsulate a nylon implant), growth rate, developmental time and size
   as an adult.
   3. Hiding behaviour was rank-order repeatable, and in general, juveniles
   were bolder than adults. Individuals that were cautious at early
   juvenile stages had higher encapsulation responses late in life compared
   with bold individuals. Most clearly, fast-growing individuals matured
   early and invested little in immune defence compared with their
   slower-growing conspecifics, i. e. showed patterns of a ` grow fast, die
   young' life-history strategy.
   4. Our results may arise from a trade-off between immunity-dependent
   survival and bold behaviour. Trade-offs between investment in survival
   and behaviour could account for the maintenance of variation in
   personality traits by favouring certain combinations of behavioural and
   life-history strategies (i. e. pace-of-life-syndromes).}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{729-743}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypes vary hierarchically among taxa and populations, among
   genotypes within populations, among individuals within genotypes, and
   also within individuals for repeatedly expressed, labile phenotypic
   traits. This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly
   defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory
   framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two
   consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing
   among individuals within populations has long been of interest to
   evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less
   emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes
   (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic
   plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same
   individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us
   to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation.
   We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may
   influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions
   among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness
   consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance.
   Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance
   reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the
   preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we
   extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both
   adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes
   (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to
   examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions
   linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits are becoming increasingly important in explaining
   adaptive individual differences in animal behaviour and probably
   represent a leading edge of the evolutionary process. Despite the
   new-found interest in animal personality among behavioural ecologists,
   few studies have investigated the link between personality traits and
   fitness measures. We examined this link using male rainbowfish,
   Melanotaenia duboulayi, as a model species and found that a range of
   personality traits (aggression, activity and boldness) covaried with a
   male's position in a hierarchy, which is directly related to
   reproductive success in this and many other species. Dominant fish were
   more aggressive, active, bold and also significantly larger than
   subordinate fish. Moreover, we found strong correlations between
   activity levels and boldness suggesting that selection may act on a
   suite of traits in concert (sensu behavioural syndromes). When taken
   together with previous research, our results suggest that the
   activity-boldness syndrome is likely to be domain specific. We suggest
   that multiple trait correlations may be generated by high levels of
   competition (e. g. sexual selection) in addition to predation pressure
   as identified by previous studies. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Research on animal personality variation has been burgeoning in the last
   20 years but surprisingly few studies have investigated personalities in
   invertebrate species although they make up 98\% of all animal species.
   Such lack of invertebrate studies might be due to a traditional belief
   that invertebrates are just `minirobots'. Lately, studies highlighting
   personality differences in a range of invertebrate species have
   challenged this idea. However, the number of invertebrate species
   investigated still contrasts markedly with the effort that has been made
   studying vertebrates, which represent only a single subphylum. We
   describe how investigating proximate, evolutionary and ecological
   correlates of personality variation in invertebrates may broaden our
   understanding of personality variation in general. In our opinion,
   personality studies on invertebrates are much needed, because
   invertebrates exhibit a range of aspects in their life histories, social
   and sexual behaviours that are extremely rare or absent in most studied
   vertebrates, but that offer new avenues for personality research.
   Examples are complete metamorphosis, male emasculation during
   copulation, asexual reproduction, eusociality and parasitism. Further
   invertebrate personality studies could enable a comparative approach to
   unravel how past selective forces have driven the evolution of
   personality differences. Finally, we point out the advantages of
   studying personality variation in many invertebrate species, such as
   easier access to relevant data on proximate and ultimate factors,
   arising from easy maintenance, fast life cycles and short generation
   times. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{According to basic evoludonary theory, individuals within a population
   should adapt their behavior in response to their current physical and
   social environment. However, there is now evidence from a diverse range
   of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad
   behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally
   shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that
   there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We
   aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama
   (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual
   male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome?
   and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with
   individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas
   by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual
   agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder
   males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving
   throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a
   behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home
   ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail
   loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the
   form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We
   suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral
   syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs. Key words: Agama

Title = {{Parasite manipulation of host personality and behavioural syndromes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{216}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The past decades have seen mounting evidence that parasites alter their
   host's behaviour in ways that benefit transmission, based on differences
   in the expression of behavioural traits between infected and control
   individuals, or on significant correlations between trait expression and
   infection levels. The multidimensional nature of host manipulation has
   only recently been recognised: parasites do not target single host
   traits, but instead suites of interrelated traits. Here, I use recent
   research on animal personality (behavioural differences among
   individuals consistent across time and situations) and behavioural
   syndromes (correlations at the population level among distinct
   behavioural traits, or between the same trait expressed in different
   contexts) to provide a framework from which simple testable patterns of
   host behavioural changes can be predicted. Following infection, a
   manipulative parasite could (i) change the temporal consistency of its
   host's behavioural responses, (ii) change the slope of a host reaction
   norm, i. e. the way host behavioural traits are expressed as a function
   of an environmental gradient, or (iii) decouple two or more host
   behavioural traits and/or change the way in which they correlate with
   each other. Two case studies involving trematode parasites and their
   freshwater hosts are used to provide empirical illustrations of the
   above scenarios. These clearly illustrate the full richness of
   behavioural alterations induced by parasites, and how these effects
   would go unnoticed using the classical trait-by-trait comparisons of
   mean values between parasitised and non-parasitised individuals.
   However, the power of animal personality and behavioural syndromes to
   inform research on host manipulation by parasites will only be fully
   realised when underlying mechanisms are elucidated and linked to their
   phenotypic impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions.
   Such `animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural
   flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that
   between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve
   if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with
   high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should
   behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower
   expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness
   expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky
   behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested
   this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed
   adjust their `exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour,
   to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus
   major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival
   probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking
   behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability.
   We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic
   effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive
   personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key
   prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history
   trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution
   of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future
   fitness expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour is typically regarded as among the most flexible of animal
   phenotypic traits. In particular, expression of cooperative behaviour is
   often assumed to be conditional upon the behaviours of others. This
   flexibility is a key component of many hypothesized mechanisms favouring
   the evolution of cooperative behaviour. However, evidence shows that
   cooperative behaviours are often less flexible than expected and that,
   in many species, individuals show consistent differences in the amount
   and type of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviours displayed. This
   phenomenon is known as `animal personality' or a `behavioural syndrome'.
   Animal personality is evolutionarily relevant, as it typically shows
   heritable variation and can entail fitness consequences, and hence, is
   subject to evolutionary change. Here, we review the empirical evidence
   for individual variation in cooperative behaviour across taxa, we
   examine the evolutionary processes that have been invoked to explain the
   existence of individual variation in cooperative behaviour and we
   discuss the consequences of consistent individual differences on the
   evolutionary stability of cooperation. We highlight that consistent
   individual variation in cooperativeness can both stabilize or disrupt
   cooperation in populations. We conclude that recognizing the existence
   of consistent individual differences in cooperativeness is essential for
   an understanding of the evolution and prevalence of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research regarding correlations among behaviors-under the labels
   of behavioral syndromes and animal personalities-has typically assumed
   that phenotypic correlations between behaviors are representative of
   underlying genetic correlations. However, for behaviors, the concordance
   between phenotypic and genetic correlations has not been rigorously
   examined. I tested this assumption using published estimates and found
   phenotypic and genetic correlations to be strongly related but found
   that the average absolute difference between the two was quite high and
   similar to that observed in other traits. Using absolute differences as
   the sole criterion, phenotypic correlations do not reliably estimate the
   magnitude of genetic correlations for behaviors, which is problematic
   for behavioral syndrome researchers. However, phenotypic correlations
   explained 75\% of the variation in genetic correlations and their sign
   was typically the same as that of genetic correlations. This suggests
   that phenotypic correlations between behaviors reliably estimate the
   direction of underling genetic relationships and provide considerable
   information regarding the magnitude of genetic correlations. Thus, if
   researchers are careful about the questions they ask, phenotypic
   correlations between behaviors can be informative regarding underlying
   genetic correlations and their evolutionary implications.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the factors causing variation in behavioural
   plasticity and the interplay between personality and plasticity.
   Habituation to predators is a special case of behavioural plasticity. We
   investigated the direct and indirect effects of boldness, exploration
   and sociability traits on the habituation ability of Iberian wall
   lizards, considering exposure and sex effects. Individual boldness was
   consistent across several non-habituation contexts, but it did not
   significantly affect habituation. Exploration had a strong direct effect
   on habituation, with more exploratory individuals being able to
   habituate faster than less exploratory ones, probably because of their
   ability to assess risk better. Individual variation in habituation was
   also affected by sociability, but this was an indirect effect mediated
   by exposure to the predator. Less social individuals avoided refuges
   with conspecific cues, increasing exposure to the predator and
   eventually habituation. Finally, the direct effects of sex (females
   habituated faster than males) were opposite to its indirect effects
   through exposure. We conclude that risk assessment, instead of the
   proactivity-reactivity gradient usually considered in the literature,
   can affect behavioural plasticity through complex interactions between
   direct and indirect effects, including exploratory behaviour, degree of
   exposure to the predator and sex, which represent novel mechanisms
   generating inter-individual variation in plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Several personality traits are mainly expressed in a social context, and
   others, which are not restricted to a social context, can be affected by
   the social interactions with conspecifics. In this paper, we focus on
   the recently proposed hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e.
   individuals in a population occupy different social roles) can explain
   the maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first
   present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses. In
   particular, we show how niche specialization can be quantified and
   highlight the link between personality differences and social niche
   specialization. We then review some ecological factors (e. g.
   competition and environmental heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms
   (e. g. frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness) that
   may be associated with the evolution of social niche specialization and
   personality differences. Finally, we present a conceptual model and
   methods to quantify the contribution of ecological factors and social
   mechanisms to the dynamics between personality and social roles. In
   doing so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help empirical
   advances in this research area. Throughout this paper, we highlight
   empirical studies of social niche specialization in mammals, where
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with
   animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that
   studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may
   not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some
   individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between
   boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the
   Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed
   in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between
   nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness
   consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by
   factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated
   to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity
   (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold
   individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had
   higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation
   model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and
   reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits
   (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals
   for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently
   underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the
   populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either
   develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for
   obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum
   bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. (C) 2012 The

Title = {{Quantifying individual variation in reaction norms: how study design
   affects the accuracy, precision and power of random regression models}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Quantifying individual heterogeneity in plasticity is becoming common
   in studies of evolutionary ecology, climate change ecology and animal
   personality. Individual variation in reaction norms is typically
   quantified using random effects in a mixed modelling framework. However,
   little is known about what sampling effort and design provide sufficient
   accuracy, precision and power. 2. I developed ` odprism', an easy-to-use
   software package for the statistical language R, which can be used to
   investigate the accuracy, precision and power of random regression
   models for various types of data structures. Moreover, I conducted
   simulations to derive rules-of-thumb for four design decisions that
   biologists often face. 3. First, I investigated the trade-off between
   sampling many individuals a few times versus sampling few individuals
   often. Generally, at least 40 individuals should be sampled with a total
   sample size of at least 1000 to obtain accurate and precise estimates of
   individual variation in elevation and slopes of linear reaction norms
   and their correlation. Contrasting a previous recommendation, it is
   worthwhile to bias the ratio of number of individuals over replicates
   towards sampling more individuals. 4. Second, I considered how the range
   of environmental conditions over which individuals are sampled affects
   the optimal sampling strategy. I show that when all individuals
   experience the same conditions during a sampling event, sampling each
   individual only twice should be strictly avoided. 5. Third, I examined
   the case where the number of replicates per individual is constrained by
   their lifespan, as is common when sampling annual traits in the wild. I
   show that for a given sampling effort, it is much easier to detect
   individual variation in reaction norms for long-lived than for
   shortlived species. 6. Fourth, I investigated the performance of random
   regression models when studying traits under selection. Reassuringly,
   directional viability selection barely caused any bias in estimates of
   variance components. 7. Random regression models are inherently data
   hungry, and reviewing the literature shows that particularly behavioural
   studies have low sampling effort. Therefore, the software and rulesof-
   thumbs I identified for designing reaction-norm studies should help
   researchers make more informed choices, which likely improve the
   reliability and interpretation of plasticity studies.}},

Abstract = {{hi the broadest sense, personality refers to stable inter-individual
   variability in behavioural organisation within a particular population.
   Researching personality in human as well as nonhuman species provides
   unique possibilities for comparisons across species with different
   phylogenies, ecologies and social systems. It also allows insights into
   mechanisms and processes of the evolution of population differences
   within and between species. The enormous diversity across species
   entails particular challenges to methodology. This paper explores
   theoretical approaches and analytical methods of deriving dimensions of
   inter-individual variability on different population. levels from a
   personality trait perspective. The existing diversity suggests that some
   populations, especially some species, may exhibit different or even
   unique trait domains. Therefore, a methodology is needed that identifies
   ecologically valid and comprehensive representations of the personality
   variation within each population. I taxonomise and compare current
   approaches in their suitability for this task. I propose a new bottom-up
   approach-the behavioural repertoire approach-that is tailored to the
   specific methodological requirements of comparative personality
   research. Initial empirical results in nonhuman primates emphasise the
   viability of this approach and highlight interesting implications for
   human personality research. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The maternal environment exerts important influences on offspring
   mass/growth, metabolism, reproduction, neurobiology, immune function,
   and behavior among birds, insects, reptiles, fish, and mammals. For
   mammals, mother's milk is an important physiological pathway for
   nutrient transfer and glucocorticoid signaling that potentially
   influences offspring growth and behavioral phenotype. Glucocorticoids in
   mother's milk have been associated with offspring behavioral phenotype
   in several mammals, but studies have been handicapped by not
   simultaneously evaluating milk energy density and yield. This is
   problematic as milk glucocorticoids and nutrients likely have
   simultaneous effects on offspring phenotype. We investigated mother's
   milk and infant temperament and growth in a cohort of rhesus macaque
   (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant dyads at the California National Primate
   Research Center (N = 108). Glucocorticoids in mother's milk, independent
   of available milk energy, predicted a more Nervous, less Confident
   temperament in both sons and daughters. We additionally found sex
   differences in the windows of sensitivity and the magnitude of
   sensitivity to maternal-origin glucocorticoids. Lower parity mothers
   produced milk with higher cortisol concentrations. Lastly, higher
   cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant
   weight gain across time. Taken together, these results suggest that
   mothers with fewer somatic resources, even in captivity, may be
   ``programming{''} through cortisol signaling, behaviorally cautious
   offspring that prioritize growth. Glucocorticoids ingested through milk
   may importantly contribute to the assimilation of available milk energy,
   development of temperament, and orchestrate, in part, the allocation of
   maternal milk energy between growth and behavioral phenotype.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-54}},

Abstract = {{When animals are observed on multiple occasions, consistent
   between-individual differences in behaviour, often referred to as animal
   personality, may be observed. However, this does not mean that the
   behaviour of a given individual is readily predictable. While some
   individuals show low levels of variation around their behavioural mean,
   others show high levels of variation, and there may be significant
   between-individual differences in this intraindividual variation ('IIV')
   in behaviour. While it has been suggested that IIV might reduce
   susceptibility to predators, little is known about the functions or
   causation of IIV. We investigated the effects of temperature on the
   startle response duration of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus. For
   poikilothermic animals, temperature has a direct and multiplicative
   influence on metabolic rate, which in turn is expected to influence
   behaviour because of its effect on energy requirements. At the level of
   mean startle response durations, the effect of temperature was dependent
   on treatment order; within treatment orders, individuals showed
   different reaction norms. In contrast, at the level of IIV, while the
   presence of significant between-individual differences was dependent on
   treatment order, there was a clear unidirectional effect in both
   treatment orders for individuals to be less predictable at higher
   temperature. Thus, predictability in behaviour appears to vary with a
   key environmental variable that is known to influence energy
   requirements and potentially the level of risk that individuals are
   willing to accept. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Using a multidisciplinary approach, the present study complements
   ethological behaviour measurements with basic theoretical concepts,
   methods and approaches of the personality psychological trait paradigm.
   Its adoptability and usefulness for animal studies are tested
   exemplarily on a sample of 20 zoo-housed great apes (five of each of the
   following species): bonobos, Pan paniscus; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes
   verus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla; and orang-utans, Pongo
   pygmaeus abelii. Data on 76 single trait-relevant behaviours were
   recorded in a series of 14 laboratory-based situations and in two
   different group situations. Data collection was repeated completely
   after a break of 2 weeks within a 50-day period. All behaviour records
   were sufficiently reliable. Individual- and variable-oriented analyses
   showed high/substantial temporal stability on different levels of
   aggregation. Distinctive and stable individual situational and response
   profiles clarified the importance of situations and of multiple
   trait-relevant behaviours. The present study calls for a closer
   collaboration between behavioural biologists and personality
   psychologists to tap the full potential of animal personality research.

Abstract = {{The number of studies investigating links between among-individual
   differences in metabolic rate (MR) and behavior has grown dramatically
   in the past several years. A major and often untested assumption of
   these studies is that the selected measure of MR is a valid proxy for
   energetic constraints. We argue that without explicitly testing this
   assumption, observed patterns between MR and behavior are
   uninterpretable. We provide guidelines for evaluating how a given
   measure of MR relates to constraints on the acquisition or expenditure
   of energy. The approach we advocate will allow researchers to develop
   and test a priori predictions relating energy metabolism and behavior.
   We conclude by highlighting several exciting directions for future work
   in this rapidly growing field.}},

Abstract = {{How different levels of biological organization interact to shape each
   other's function is a central question in biology. One particularly
   important topic in this context is how individuals' variation in
   behaviour shapes group-level characteristics. We investigated how fish
   that express different locomotory behaviour in an asocial context move
   collectively when in groups. First, we established that individual fish
   have characteristic, repeatable locomotion behaviours (i.e. median
   speeds, variance in speeds and median turning speeds) when tested on
   their own. When tested in groups of two, four or eight fish, we found
   individuals partly maintained their asocial median speed and median
   turning speed preferences, while their variance in speed preference was
   lost. The strength of this individuality decreased as group size
   increased, with individuals conforming to the speed of the group, while
   also decreasing the variability in their own speed. Further, individuals
   adopted movement characteristics that were dependent on what group size
   they were in. This study therefore shows the influence of social context
   on individual behaviour. If the results found here can be generalized
   across species and contexts, then although individuality is not entirely
   lost in groups, social conformity and group-size-dependent effects drive
   how individuals will adjust their behaviour in groups.}},

Abstract = {{This paper sets out the case that personality traits are central to
   health psychology. To achieve this, three aims need to be addressed.
   First, it is necessary to show that personality influences a broad range
   of health outcomes and mechanisms. Second, the simple descriptive
   account of Aim 1 is not sufficient, and a theoretical specification
   needs to be developed to explain the personality-health link and allow
   for future hypothesis generation. Third, once Aims 1 and 2 are met, it
   is necessary to demonstrate the clinical utility of personality. In this
   review I make the case that all three Aims are met. I develop a
   theoretical framework to understand the links between personality and
   health drawing on current theorising in the biology, evolution, and
   neuroscience of personality. I identify traits (i.e., alexithymia, Type
   D, hypochondriasis, and empathy) that are of particular concern to
   health psychology and set these within evolutionary cost-benefit
   analysis. The literature is reviewed within a three-level hierarchical
   model (individual, group, and organisational) and it is argued that
   health psychology needs to move from its traditional focus on the
   individual level to engage group and organisational levels.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Personality differences can be found in a wide range of species across
   the animal kingdom, but why natural selection gave rise to such
   differences remains an open question. Frequency-dependent selection is a
   potent mechanism explaining variation; it does not explain, however, the
   other two key features associated with personalities, consistency and
   correlations. Using the hawk-dove game and a frequency-dependent
   foraging game as examples, we here show that this changes fundamentally
   whenever one takes into account the physiological architecture
   underlying behavior (e.g., metabolism). We find that the inclusion of
   physiology changes the evolutionary predictions concerning consistency
   and correlations: while selection gives rise to inconsistent individuals
   and stochastically fluctuating behavioral correlations in scenarios that
   neglect physiology, we find high levels of behavioral consistency and
   tight and stable trait correlations in scenarios that incorporate
   physiology. The coevolution of behavioral and physiological traits also
   gives rise to adaptive physiological differences that are systematically
   associated with behavioral differences. As well as providing a framework
   for understanding behavioral consistency and behavioral correlations,
   our work thus also provides an explanation for systematic physiological
   differences within populations, a phenomenon that appears to exist in a
   wide range of species but that, up to now, has been poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to
   individual life histories and to environmental variation. The
   reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether
   individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive
   options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and
   anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis,
   however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration
   behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits
   (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk.
   Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor
   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization creates novel environments for wild animals where selection
   pressures may differ drastically from those in natural habitats.
   Adaptation to urban life involves changes in various traits, including
   behavior. Behavioral traits often vary consistently among individuals,
   and these so-called personality traits can be correlated with each
   other, forming behavioral syndromes. Despite their adaptive significance
   and potential to act as constraints, little is known about the role of
   animal personality and behavioral syndromes in animals' adaptation to
   urban habitats. In this study we tested whether differently urbanized
   habitats select for different personalities and behavioral syndromes by
   altering the population mean, inter-individual variability, and
   correlations of personality traits. We captured house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus) from four different populations along the gradient of
   urbanization and assessed their behavior in standardized test
   situations. We found individual consistency in neophobia, risk taking,
   and activity, constituting three personality axes. On the one hand,
   urbanization did not consistently affect the mean and variance of these
   traits, although there were significant differences between some of the
   populations in food neophobia and risk taking (both in means and
   variances). On the other hand, both urban and rural birds exhibited a
   behavioral syndrome including object neophobia, risk taking and
   activity, whereas food neophobia was part of the syndrome only in rural
   birds. These results indicate that there are population differences in
   certain aspects of personality in house sparrows, some of which may be
   related to habitat urbanization. Our findings suggest that urbanization
   and/or other population-level habitat differences may not only influence
   the expression of personality traits but also alter their
   inter-individual variability and the relationships among them, changing
   the structure of behavioral syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Research on animal personality can be approached from both a phenotypic
   and a genetic perspective. While using a phenotypic approach one can
   measure present selection on personality traits and their combinations.
   However, this approach cannot reconstruct the historical trajectory that
   was taken by evolution. Therefore, it is essential for our understanding
   of the causes and consequences of personality diversity to link
   phenotypic variation in personality traits with polymorphisms in genomic
   regions that code for this trait variation. Identifying genes or genome
   regions that underlie personality traits will open exciting
   possibilities to study natural selection at the molecular level,
   gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, pleiotropic effects and how
   gene expression shapes personality phenotypes. In this paper, we will
   discuss how genome information revealed by already established
   approaches and some more recent techniques such as high-throughput
   sequencing of genomic regions in a large number of individuals can be
   used to infer micro-evolutionary processes, historical selection and
   finally the maintenance of personality trait variation. We will do this
   by reviewing recent advances in molecular genetics of animal
   personality, but will also use advanced human personality studies as
   case studies of how molecular information may be used in animal
   personality research in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Activity is an important behavioral trait that mediates a trade-off
   between obtaining food for growth and avoiding predation. Active
   individuals usually experience a higher encounter rate with food items
   and suffer higher predation pressure than less active individuals. I
   investigated how activity of the damselfly Lestes congener is affected
   by larval state and predator presence and if larval behavioral type (BT)
   can be used to predict larval boldness, foraging success, and adult BT.
   Activity level of individual larvae was studied without predator at 2
   different physiological states (hungry and fed) and in 2 predator
   treatments: familiar predator cues and unfamiliar predator cues. Larvae
   did not adjust their activity depending on state or when subjected to
   unfamiliar predator cues, but a general reduction in activity was seen
   in the familiar predator treatment. Hence, active individuals remained
   active compared with their conspecifics, independent of state or
   predator treatment. Active individuals were also bolder and more
   efficient foragers than their less active conspecifics. Furthermore,
   both adult activity and boldness were correlated with larval BT. The
   results illustrate that BT of a larvae is carried over many different
   situations keeping active larvae active even in maladaptive situations,
   demonstrating how a behavioral syndrome may constrain behavioral
   plasticity. Furthermore, results showed that behavioral syndromes can
   carry over from larvae through metamorphosis and dictate the BT of the
   adult.}},

Title = {{Using repeatability to study physiological and behavioural traits:
   ignore time-related change at your peril}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{223-230}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Broad sense repeatability, which refers to the extent to which
   individual differences in trait scores are maintained over time, is of
   increasing interest to researchers studying behavioural or physiological
   traits. Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the
   statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability).
   However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal
   nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by
   showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating
   broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power.
   Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related
   change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect
   estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or
   physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of
   R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability,
   and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies.
   Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile
   traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a
   shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability
   of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits
   are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control
   and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time
   (if present). (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which group-living animals collectively exploit
   resources, and the role of individuals in group decisions, are central
   issues for understanding animal distribution patterns. We investigated
   the extent to which boldness and shyness affect the distribution of
   social herbivores across vegetation patches, using sheep as a model
   species. Using an experimental and a theoretical approach, we show that
   collective choices emerge through the nonlinear dynamics of interactions
   between individuals, at both short and long distances. Within a range of
   parameter values derived from the observation of homogeneous groups of
   each behavioural type, we propose a simple mechanism whereby the same
   interaction rules can result in different patterns of distribution
   across patches for bold and shy individuals. We present a mathematical
   model based on behavioural rules derived from experiments, in which
   crowding and con-specific attraction affect the probability of entering
   or leaving patches. Variation in the strength of social attraction is
   sufficient to account for differences in spatial distribution across
   patches. The model predicts that resource fragmentation more strongly
   affects the distribution patterns of shy groups, and suggests that the
   presence of both bold and shy individuals within groups would result in
   more flexible behaviour at the population level.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations in behavioural traits across time, situation and ecological
   context (i.e. `behavioural syndromes' or `personality') have been
   documented for a variety of behaviours, and in diverse taxa. Perhaps the
   most controversial inference from the behavioural syndromes literature
   is that correlated behaviour may act as an evolutionary constraint and
   evolutionary change in one's behaviour may necessarily involve shifts in
   others. We test the two predictions of this hypothesis using comparative
   data from eighteen populations of the socially polymorphic spider,
   Anelosimus studiosus (Araneae, Theriidae). First, we ask whether
   geographically distant populations share a common syndrome. Second, we
   test whether population differences in behaviour are correlated
   similarly to within-population trait correlations. Our results reveal
   that populations separated by as much as 36 degrees latitude shared
   similar syndromes. Furthermore, population differences in behaviour were
   correlated in the same manner as within-population trait correlations.
   That is, population divergence tended to be along the same axes as
   within-population covariance. Together, these results suggest a lack of
   evolutionary independence in the syndrome's constituent traits.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known, long-term, organizational actions of sex
   steroids on phenotypic differences between the sexes, studies of
   maternal steroids in the vertebrate egg have mainly focused on effects
   seen in early life. Long-term organizational effects of yolk hormones on
   adult behavior and the underlying mechanisms that generate them have
   been largely ignored. Using an experiment in which hand-reared house
   sparrows (Passer domesticus) from testosterone- or control-treated eggs
   were kept under identical conditions, we show that testosterone
   treatment in the egg increased the frequency of aggressive, dominance,
   and sexual behavior of 1-year-old, reproductively competent house
   sparrows. We also show that circulating plasma levels of progesterone,
   testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol did not
   differ between treatment groups. Thus, a simple change in adult gonadal
   hormone secretion is not the primary physiological cause of long-term
   effects of maternal steroids on adult behavior. Rather, differences in
   adult behavior caused by exposure to yolk testosterone during embryonic
   development are likely generated by organizational modifications of
   brain function. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that
   hormone-mediated maternal effects are an epigenetic mechanism causing
   intra-sexual variation in adult behavioral phenotype. (c) 2008 Wiley

Abstract = {{Animal `personality' describes consistent individual differences in
   suites of behaviors, a phenomenon exhibited in diverse animal taxa and
   shown to be under natural and sexual selection. It has been suggested
   that variation in personality reflects underlying physiological
   variation; however there is limited empirical evidence to test this
   hypothesis in wild animals. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is
   hypothesized to play a central role in personality variation. Here we
   tested whether in great tits Parus major variation in personality traits
   is related to plasma concentrations of corticosterone (CORT). Using a
   capture-restraint protocol we examined baseline and stress-induced COAT
   levels in two captive experimental groups: (1) birds selected for
   divergent personalities ('fast-bold' and `slow-shy' explorers); and (2)
   non-selected offspring of wild parents. We first tested for differences
   in CORT between selection lines, and second examined the relationship
   between responses in a canonical personality test and CURT
   concentrations in non-selected birds. We found support for our
   prediction that the slow-shy line would exhibit a higher acute stress
   response than the fast-bold line, indicating a genetic correlation
   between exploratory behavior and stress physiology. We did not, however,
   find that continuous variation in exploratory behavior co-varies with
   CURT concentrations in non-selected birds. While our results provide
   support for the idea that personality emerges as a result of correlated
   selection on behavior and underlying physiological mechanisms, they also
   indicate that this link may be particularly evident when composite
   personality traits are the target of selection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Sampling bias is a key issue to consider when designing studies to
   address biological questions and its importance has been widely
   discussed in the literature. However, some forms of bias remain
   underestimated. We investigated the roosting decisions of free-living
   great tits utilizing nest-boxes in response to the installation of a
   novel object (a miniature video camera) inside their nest-boxes. We show
   that birds that score highly on a widely used exploration test (i.e.,
   fast explorers) are more likely to accept and approach novel objects
   used in a seemingly unobtrusive sampling technique; thus, the sample
   collected overrepresents fast explorers. This form of behavior-related
   bias, sensitivity to novel objects, has largely been overlooked in
   sampling design. We demonstrate potential pitfalls of neglecting this
   behavior-related sampling bias in biological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatable behavioural traits ('personality') have been shown to covary
   with fitness, but it remains poorly understood how such
   behaviour-fitness relationships come about. We applied a multivariate
   approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in
   exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in
   reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes
   caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for
   provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and
   reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed
   their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the
   same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased
   female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production.
   Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning
   behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their
   offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus
   increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for
   specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural
   syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between
   behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when
   considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance
   of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to
   the study of behavioural evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the manner by which individual differences in personality
   arise and are maintained in animal populations is currently a topic of
   considerable research interest. This is particularly the case when it
   comes to developmental processes and understanding how behaviors change
   over ontogeny. Such developmental perspectives are essential given that
   the vast majority of animal species possess complex life cycles or
   undergo some form of metamorphosis. Yet, in spite of the broad taxonomic
   relevance and the obvious potential importance of metamorphosis for
   understanding the basis of consistency in personality over ontogeny,
   almost no research has been done on this topic. Using the lake frog
   (Rana ridibunda) as a study organism, we tested whether individual-level
   differences in personality (activity, exploration and boldness) were
   consistent within both larval and juvenile frog life-history stages and
   across metamorphosis. We found that most behaviors of interest were
   highly consistent within a given life-history stage and at least some
   traits were consistent across metamorphosis (e. g., activity and
   exploration). Generally, more active, exploratory individuals in novel
   experimental arenas were also bolder and more likely to spend time in
   more risky open areas of a familiar environment. To our knowledge, our
   study is the first to both characterize personality traits across anuran
   development and provide evidence of consistency in behavior across
   metamorphosis in a vertebrate species.}},

Abstract = {{Animal researchers are increasingly interested in individual differences
   in behavior. Their interpretation as meaningful differences in
   behavioral strategies stable over time and across contexts, adaptive,
   heritable, and acted upon by natural selection has triggered new
   theoretical developments. However, the analytical approaches used to
   explore behavioral data still address population-level phenomena, and
   statistical methods suitable to analyze individual behavior are rarely
   applied. I discuss fundamental investigative principles and analytical
   approaches to explore whether, in what ways, and under which conditions
   individual behavioral differences are actually meaningful. I elaborate
   the meta-theoretical ideas underlying common theoretical concepts and
   integrate them into an overarching meta-theoretical and methodological
   framework. This unravels commonalities and differences, and shows that
   assumptions of analogy to concepts of human personality are not always
   warranted and that some theoretical developments may be based on
   methodological artifacts. Yet, my results also highlight possible
   directions for new theoretical developments in animal behavior research.

Abstract = {{Individuals are often consistent in their behavior but vary from each
   other in the level of behavior shown. Despite burgeoning interest in
   such animal personality variation, studies on invertebrates are scarce,
   and studies on clonal invertebrates nonexistent. This is surprising
   given the obvious advantages of using invertebrates/clones to tackle the
   crucial question why such consistent behavioral differences exist. Here
   we show that individuals of clonal pea aphids exhibit consistent
   behavioral differences in their escape responses to a predator attack
   (dropping vs. nondropping off a plant). However, behavior was not
   repeatable at the clonal level. Genetically identical clones expressed
   various phenotypes but different clones produced different proportions
   of each phenotype (dropper, nondropper, and inconsistent). Manipulations
   of early environmental conditions had little qualitative impact on such
   patterns. We discuss the importance of our findings for future studies
   of the evolutionary and ecological consequences of personality

Abstract = {{Recent studies have examined the ecological and evolutionary bases for
   variation in animal personality. However, only a few such studies have
   examined how foraging parameters are influenced by different personality
   domains. In wild ungulates, the trade-off between the time spent on food
   intake and antipredator behaviour differs between individuals, but the
   underlying reason for this is not yet well understood. One possibility
   is that this trade-off reflects personality dimensions such as boldness.
   To relate foraging decisions to personality we measured personality and
   performed feeding experiments with familiar and novel food in familiar
   and novel situations. We measured personality traits in 15 tame fallow
   deer, using novel object tests (NO), behavioural observations (BO) and
   personality ratings (PR). Boldness dimensions were found using PR and
   NO, dominance dimensions were found using BO and PR, and a flexibility
   dimension was found using BO. Multitrait-multimethod analysis showed
   that similar dimensions were significantly correlated across different
   methods and that different dimensions were not significantly correlated,
   even if measured using the same method. We also found that novel food
   eaten in familiar situations and familiar food eaten in novel situations
   were strongly related to boldness but not dominance, flexibility or age.
   Thus the trade-off between the benefits of gaining more food and the
   costs of reduced vigilance or increased toxin ingestion reflect
   boldness. These findings highlight the nature of personality dimensions
   in ungulates and how boldness impacts foraging behaviour. (c) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Animals are known to exhibit `personality'; that is, individual
   differences in behaviour that are consistent across time and/or
   situations. One axis of personality of particular importance for
   behavioural ecology is boldness, which can be defined as the tendency of
   an individual to take risks. The relationship between individual
   personality and fitness correlates, particularly those involved in
   reproduction, remains largely unexplored. In the current study, we used
   female Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to ascertain whether
   certain reproductive traits (e.g. stage of pregnancy, fecundity) are
   correlated with individual personality in two wild populations in New
   South Wales, Australia. To quantitatively assess this relationship, we
   tested individual fish for their level of boldness, as measured by their
   latency to exit a refuge and tendency to shoal in a novel environment.
   We also quantified individual differences in general activity and
   tendency to swim near the water surface and substratum. For both
   populations taken together, bolder individuals tended to be smaller,
   relatively less fecund (when taking body size into account), and spent
   more time near the water surface than near the substratum compared with
   timid individuals. Individual boldness was not correlated with either
   general activity or stage of pregnancy. To our knowledge, our study
   characterizes for the first time a relationship between an individual
   personality trait (boldness) and a reproductive fitness correlate
   (fecundity) in fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that
   individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both
   across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have
   personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an
   individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas
   it is well established that the environment can have profound influences
   on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely
   linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to
   contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the
   environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the
   life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle,
   Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality
   food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared
   on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to
   vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3
   personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted
   explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality
   dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future
   prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder,
   thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in
   foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more
   active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future
   reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the
   energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not
   only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an
   individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling
   phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain
   intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour,
   which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations.
   Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main
   life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual
   differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals
   of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using
   open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity,
   exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found
   systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different
   residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high
   expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high
   current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age.
   Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body
   condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal
   variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction might maintain personality
   variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this
   life-history trade-off hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits are important because they can affect individual
   survival as well as how a population may respond to environmental
   change. How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout
   ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them
   throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is
   important for determining the function and evolution of animal
   personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied
   personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of
   yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected
   between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age
   groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age
   classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the
   three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation
   distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots'
   response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in
   yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found
   that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no
   behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage.
   This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits
   develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus,
   the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping
   with age-dependent requirements and constraints. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in boldness have been identified in
   many species and can have important effects on fitness. In most animals,
   juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than
   do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and
   environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the
   boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets,
   adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling
   increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness
   (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets.
   Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We
   found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but
   not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we
   predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also
   found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that
   individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when
   they were nymphs, versus when they were adults.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in behavioural and evolutionary ecology is to
   understand the evolution and maintenance of consistent behavioural
   differences among individuals within populations, often referred to as
   animal `personalities'. Here, we present evidence suggesting that sexual
   selection may act on such personality differences in zebra finches
   (Taeniopygia guttata), as females seem to choose males on the basis of
   their exploratory behaviour per se, while taking into account their own
   personality. After observing a pair of males, whose apparent levels of
   exploration were experimentally manipulated, females that exhibited
   low-exploratory tendencies showed no preference during mate choice for
   males that had appeared to be either `exploratory' or `unexploratory'.
   In contrast, intermediate and highly exploratory females preferred
   apparently exploratory males over apparently unexploratory ones. Our
   results suggest that behavioural or genetic compatibility for
   personality traits might be important for mate choice, at least for
   exploratory individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have established the ecological and evolutionary
   importance of animal personalities. Individual differences in movement
   and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity,
   boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many
   species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal
   syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement
   ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other
   personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying
   framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent
   spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology
   paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions
   on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource
   distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural
   variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual
   consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead
   to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat
   preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network
   structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with
   spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with
   spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use,
   demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from
   differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of
   consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic
   understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and
   evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.}},

Abstract = {{A common method to assess behavioral types in personality research
   involves the use of a single emergence test (employed by researchers
   working on fish, avian, mammal, amphibian, and invertebrate taxa),
   whereby a shorter latency to emerge from a holding container into a
   novel environment is inferred to represent greater boldness'. Although
   any behavior might be context specific, studies using this single assay
   type must assume it reflects boldness in other similar contexts,
   otherwise it cannot reflect personality (defined as consistency across
   time and/or contexts). We attempted to validate whether a single assay
   of this type is correlated with other similar assays of boldness under
   more familiar, and less stressful, situations. We compared single
   emergence test scores of two species of damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi;
   P.amboinensis) in a novel environment, with two different behavioral
   assays of the same fish in subsequent repeated trials in home tanks.
   Although behavior was highly repeatable in home tanks, we found no
   correlation between emergence test scores in the novel environment and
   measures of latency to emerge from shelter following disturbance, or
   activity levels, on the first, second, or third observations in home
   tanks; there was also no correlation when we used average home tank
   scores from mixed models that accounted for individual differences
   (i.e., plasticity) in the rate of habituation (latency) and acclimation
   (activity). Our results therefore lead us to question the validity of
   using this single emergence test assay as a predictor of general
   boldness and to question the use of any single assay of behavior in
   personality research.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of interindividual differences in personality traits poses
   a challenge to evolutionary thinking. Although research on the ultimate
   consequences of personality differences in nonhuman animals has recently
   undergone a surge of interest, our understanding of whether and how
   personality influences reproductive decisions in humans has remained
   limited and informed primarily by modern societies with low
   mortality-fertility schedules. Taking an evolutionary approach, we use
   data from a contemporary polygynous high-fertility human population
   living in rural Senegal to investigate whether personality dimensions
   are associated with key life-history traits in humans, i.e., quantity
   and quality of offspring. We show that personality dimensions predict
   reproductive success differently in men and women in such societies and,
   in women, are associated with a trade-off between offspring quantity and
   quality. In women, neuroticism positively predicts the number of
   children, both between and within polygynous families. Furthermore,
   within the low social class, offspring quality (i.e., child nutritional
   status) decreases with a woman's neuroticism, indicating a reproductive
   trade-off between offspring quantity and quality. Consistent with this,
   maximal fitness is achieved by women at an intermediate neuroticism
   level. In men, extraversion was found to be a strong predictor of high
   social class and polygyny, with extraverted men producing more offspring
   than their introverted counterparts. These results have implications for
   the consideration of alternative adaptive hypotheses in the current
   debate on the maintenance of personality differences and the role of
   individual factors in fertility patterns in contemporary humans.}},

Abstract = {{Deciphering the mechanisms involved in shaping social structure is key
   to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes leading to
   sociality. Individual specialization within groups can increase colony
   efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis
   that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness
   and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation
   (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events
   across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of
   developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism.
   Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of
   boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with
   being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey
   capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance
   from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with
   emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey
   capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics.
   Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was
   associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance.
   Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social
   spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that
   personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory
   settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in
   the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual
   behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social
   organization in a diversity of animals.}},

Abstract = {{Although most mammals grow up in the company of same or different age
   sibs (or half sibs), surprisingly little attention has been given to how
   relations among them might influence the development of individual
   differences in morphology, physiology, and behavior. Here we review
   evidence from our work on domestic and wild European rabbits, and more
   recently on laboratory rats, mice, and domestic cats, supporting the
   proposition that in mammals early sibling relations contribute to the
   development of individual differences in these three domains and thereby
   to long-term behavioral differences of the kind we might consider part
   of an animal's behavioral style or personality. First we report a
   consistent and marked negative relation between litter size and
   individuals' body mass at birth and weaning, as well as marked
   within-litter differences in prenatal body mass and placental
   efficiency. We then report individual differences in preweaning
   behaviors associated with these morphological variables such as position
   occupied in the litter huddle and development of motor ability, as well
   as physiological differences in thermoregulation, immune parameters, and
   endocrine indicators of stress. Finally, we report first evidence from
   wild rabbits that early relations among littermates may have long-term
   consequences for individual differences in behavioral style. We conclude
   that in mammals, individual differences in early growth, physiology and
   behavior potentially important for the development of animal
   personality, are shaped to an appreciable extent by early sibling
   relations and that this little-researched field deserves closer
   attention. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 53: 564-574,

Abstract = {{Individuals often differ consistently in behaviour across time and
   contexts, and such consistent behavioural differences are commonly
   described as personality. Personality can play a central role in social
   behaviour both in dyadic interactions and in social networks. We
   investigated whether explorative behaviour, as proxy of personality of
   territorial male great tits (Parus major), predicts their own and their
   neighbours' territorial responses towards simulated intruders. Several
   weeks prior to playback, subjects were taken from the wild to test their
   exploratory behaviour in a standard context in the laboratory.
   Exploratory behaviour provides a proxy of personality along a slow-fast
   explorer continuum. Upon release, males were radio-tracked and
   subsequently exposed to interactive playback simulating a more or a less
   aggressive territorial intruder (by either overlapping or alternating
   broadcast songs with the subjects' songs). At the same time, we
   radio-tracked a neighbour of the playback subject. Male vocal responses
   during playback and spatial movements after playback varied according to
   male explorative behaviour and playback treatment. Males with lower
   exploration scores approached the loudspeaker less, and sang more songs,
   shorter songs and songs with slower element rates than did males with
   higher exploration scores. Moreover, neighbour responses were related to
   the explorative behaviour of the subject receiving the playback but not
   to their own explorative behaviour. Our overall findings reveal for the
   first time how personality traits affect resource defence within a
   communication network providing new insights on the cause of variation
   in resource defence behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The open-field test, which measures animal activity or distance covered
   by individuals subjected to a novel arena, is used frequently in
   behaviour studies. Studies generally report consistent individual
   differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested
   whether individuals change their activity level differently within a
   single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability
   of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the
   duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction
   norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in
   temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual
   temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias
   striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the
   total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time
   intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5
   min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain
   differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first
   time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated
   with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests
   yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend
   analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity
   measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity
   patterns. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Cerebral lateralization is an evolutionarily ancient adaptation,
   apparently ubiquitous among vertebrates. Despite demonstrated advantages
   of having a more lateralized brain, substantial variability in the
   strength of lateralization exists within most species. The underlying
   reasons for the maintenance of this variation are largely unknown. Here,
   we present evidence that the strength of lateralization is linked to a
   behavioural trait, aggressiveness, in the convict cichlid (Archocentrus
   nigrofasciatus), and that this relationship depends on the sex of the
   fish. This finding suggests that individual variation in behaviour may
   be linked to variation in cerebral lateralization, and must be studied
   with regard to the sex of the animal.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, animal personality researchers have called for
   integrative approaches to study behavioral, immunological, and
   life-historical traits. This is because life history and personality
   have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes.
   Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to
   associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because
   behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we
   quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and
   genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of
   behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from
   disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function
   (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and
   maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus
   integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range:
   encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas
   behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and
   encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass
   were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was
   positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack
   of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that
   the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there
   were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between
   behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and
   encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these
   associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results
   support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an
   evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that
   behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history
   variation.}},

   Sociobiol 66: 1543-1548, 2012; Garamszegi and Herczeg Behav Ecol
   Socibiol 66:1651-1658, 2012) deals with a core issue in animal
   personality research: Can animal personality research quantify
   correlated behaviors on the between-individual level, or is this too
   demanding in terms of design and analysis of the data, and should
   behavioral ecologists therefore take the ``individual gambit{''} and
   work on the phenotypic level only. Taking this gambit implies accepting
   that the between-individual correlation in behavioral traits (which is
   the correlation of interest) may be masked by a residual correlation of
   different magnitude or sign. Understanding (co)variances on different
   levels is the main thrust of quantitative genetics, and animal
   personality research can make good use of the plethora of ideas and
   analytical approaches developed in this field. I, here, outline reasons
   why the ``individual gambit{''} may or may not work out and its
   relationship to the quantitative genetic ``phenotypic gambit{''}. I
   especially emphasize the meaning of residuals and phenotypic plasticity
   which has not been fully appreciated in the debate thus far. I conclude
   that instead of a priori assuming that between-individual correlations
   are captured sufficiently well by the phenotypic correlation, animal
   personality researchers should set up more ambitious data collection and
   analysis designs to critically test this conjectured equality.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, defined as consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioral traits, are suggested to be common in the
   animal kingdom and can have important fitness consequences. Individual
   differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be
   part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect
   an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such
   environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study
   because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental
   sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration
   behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species.
   Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that
   individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the
   parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile
   wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was
   measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of
   exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly
   predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding
   exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings,
   behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better
   predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the
   relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be
   easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to
   exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity
   correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further
   highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic
   plasticity in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of personality has recently begun to attract a great deal of
   interest in behavioural ecology. However, there is also a large and
   mature literature on personality within human psychology. These two
   bodies of work have developed independently and at present make rather
   little reference to one another. The current paper has two main
   objectives. First, we seek to acquaint behavioural ecologists with the
   principal ideas and issues found in the human personality psychology
   literature. Second, we explore how ideas from the behavioural ecology
   literature might help advance research in human personality psychology.
   We suggest strong potential for convergence between the two literatures
   in the near future. Common themes of this future unified science of
   personality include the conception of personality traits as reaction
   norms, a commitment to the importance of direct measurement of
   behaviour, investigation of both proximate and ultimate explanations for
   personality variation, and a concern with the impact of personality
   variation on survival and reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in animal social networks, surprisingly little
   is known about whether individuals are consistent in their social
   network characteristics. Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an
   assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made
   when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and
   structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore
   vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for
   individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and
   ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here,
   we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large
   PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network
   metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then
   examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to
   week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in
   repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were
   significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest
   repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a
   measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for
   the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show
   that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by
   within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected
   fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare
   evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals.
   Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have
   important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their
   social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{Social animals are extraordinarily diverse and ecologically abundant. In
   understanding the success of complex animal societies, task
   differentiation has been identified as a central mechanism underlying
   the emergence and performance of adaptive collective behaviors. In this
   study, we explore how individual differences in behavior and body size
   determine task allocation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We
   found that individuals with high body condition indices were less likely
   to participate in prey capture, and individuals' tendency to engage in
   prey capture was not associated with either their behavioral traits or
   body size. No traits were associated with individuals' propensity to
   participation in web repair, but small individuals were more likely to
   engage in standard web-building. We also discovered consistent,
   differences among colonies in their collective behavior (i.e.,
   colony-level personality). At the colony level, within-colony variation
   in behavior (aggressiveness) and body size were positively associated
   with aggressive foraging behavior. Together, our findings reveal a
   subtly complex relationship between individual variation and collective
   behavior in this species. We close by comparing the relationship between
   individual variation and social organization in nine species of social
   spider. We conclude that intraspecific variation is a major force behind
   the social organization of multiple independently derived lineages of
   social spider.}},

Title = {{Can We Predict Personality in Fish? Searching for Consistency over Time
   and across Contexts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{The interest in animal personality, broadly defined as consistency of
   individual behavioural traits over time and across contexts, has
   increased dramatically over the last years. Individual differences in
   behaviour are no longer recognised as noise around a mean but rather as
   adaptive variation and thus, essentially, raw material for evolution.
   Animal personality has been considered evolutionary conserved and has
   been shown to be present in all vertebrates including fish. Despite the
   importance of evolutionary and comparative aspects in this field, few
   studies have actually documented consistency across situations in fish.
   In addition, most studies are done with individually housed fish which
   may pose additional challenges when interpreting data from social
   species. Here, we investigate, for the first time in fish, whether
   individual differences in behavioural responses to a variety of
   challenges are consistent over time and across contexts using both
   individual and grouped-based tests. Twenty-four juveniles of Gilthead
   seabream Sparus aurata were subjected to three individual-based tests:
   feed intake recovery in a novel environment, novel object and
   restraining and to two group-based tests: risk-taking and hypoxia. Each
   test was repeated twice to assess consistency of behavioural responses
   over time. Risk taking and escape behaviours during restraining were
   shown to be significantly consistent over time. In addition, consistency
   across contexts was also observed: individuals that took longer to
   recover feed intake after transfer into a novel environment exhibited
   higher escape attempts during a restraining test and escaped faster from
   hypoxia conditions. These results highlight the possibility to predict
   behaviour in groups from individual personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Both personality and plasticity can influence fitness, but few studies
   have investigated these two sources of individual variation
   simultaneously for the same behaviour. The individual quality hypothesis
   proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be
   better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a
   high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis
   proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated,
   because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to
   rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two
   hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness
   (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this
   behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their
   consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows,
   Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as
   a random effect, we found that consistent differences between
   individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness
   and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to
   variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality
   hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a
   higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a
   reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for
   the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor
   plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results
   suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important
   components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of
   each are context dependent. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Current interest in behavioural syndromes, or `animal personalities',
   reinforces a need for behavioural ecologists to adopt a multivariate
   view of phenotypes. Fortunately, many of the methodological and
   theoretical issues currently being dealt with by behavioural ecologists
   within the context of behavioural syndromes have previously been
   investigated by researchers in other areas of evolutionary ecology. As a
   result of these previous efforts, behavioural syndrome researchers have
   considerable theory and a wide range of tools already available to them.
   Here, we discuss aspects of quantitative genetics useful for
   understanding the multivariate phenotype as well as the relevance of
   quantitative genetics to behavioural syndrome research. These methods
   not only allow the proper characterization of the multivariate
   behavioural phenotype and genotype-including behaviours within, among
   and independent of behavioural syndrome structures-but also allow
   predictions as to how populations may respond to selection on behaviours
   within syndromes. An application of a quantitative genetics framework to
   behavioural syndrome research also clarifies and refines the questions
   that should be asked.}},

Abstract = {{Basal metabolic rate (BMR), commonly used as a measure of the cost of
   living, is highly variable among species, and sources of the variation
   are subject to an enduring debate among comparative biologists. One of
   the hypotheses links the variation in BMR with diversity of food habits
   and life-history traits. We test this hypothesis by asking how BMR of a
   particular species, the bank vole Myodes (= Clethrionomys) glareolus,
   would change under selection for high growth rate (measured as a
   postweaning body mass change; MD(PW)) and the ability to cope with a
   low-quality herbivorous diet (measured as body mass change during a
   four-day test; MD(LQD)). We show that both of the traits are heritable
   in the narrow sense (MD(PW): h(2) = 0.30; MD(LQD): h(2) = 0.19), and are
   genetically correlated with mass-independent BMR (additive genetic
   correlation, r(A) = 0.28 for MD(PW) and 0.37 for MD(LQD)). Thus, both of
   the traits could change in response to a selection, and the selection
   would also result in a correlated evolution of the level of metabolism.
   The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a part of the
   interspecific variation in BMR evolved in response to selection for
   life-history and ecological traits such as food habits.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of animals towards their mirror image ({''}mirror
   test{''}) is routinely used as a proxy to measure aggression levels,
   especially in fish. The lack of evidence for visual self-recognition in
   fish supports this method. However, recent work points towards different
   hormonal and gene expression responses when fish are exposed either to
   conspecific opponents or to their mirror image, urging for validation of
   this widespread method. Here, we test the predictive value of mirror
   tests in three sympatric cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika: the
   cooperative breeder Neolamprologus pulcher, the polygamous shell brooder
   Telmatochromis vittatus and the monogamous, biparental piscivore
   Lepidiolamprologus elongatus. In particular, we compare differences in
   restrained and overt aggression levels for individuals of each species
   when confronted with a mirror or a live conspecific. The three species
   differed in response to the two contest situations. While in N. pulcher
   both aggressive responses were correlated between the mirror test and
   the live opponent fight, there was no such relationship in T. vittatus
   and L. elongatus. Thus, the mirror test appears to be a suitable
   surrogate for intraspecific aggression in N. pulcher, while aggression
   against a mirror image has limited predictive value for intraspecific
   aggression in the other two species. These results underline the
   importance of validating the mirror test's predictive value in a study
   species before drawing conclusions from mirror tests about
   aggressiveness under natural, social conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour, and behavioural
   correlations within and across contexts, are referred to as animal
   personalities. These patterns of variation have been identified in many
   animal taxa and are likely to have important ecological and evolutionary
   consequences. Despite their importance, genetic and environmental
   sources of variation in personalities have rarely been characterized in
   wild populations. We used a Bayesian animal model approach to estimate
   genetic parameters for aggression, activity and docility in North
   American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We found support for
   low heritabilities (0.080.12), and cohort effects (0.070.09), as well as
   low to moderate maternal effects (0.070.15) and permanent environmental
   effects (0.080.16). Finally, we found evidence of a substantial positive
   genetic correlation (0.68) and maternal effects correlation (0.58)
   between activity and aggression providing evidence of genetically based
   behavioural correlations in red squirrels. These results provide
   evidence for the presence of heritable variation in red squirrel
   behaviour, but also emphasize the role of other sources of variation,
   including maternal effects, in shaping patterns of variation and
   covariation in behavioural traits.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Pages = {{580-588}},
Abstract = {{Social insect colonies and the workers comprising them, each exhibit
   consistent individual differences in behavior, also known as
   `personalities'. Because the behavior of social insect colonies emerges
   from the actions of their workers, individual variation among workers'
   personality may be important in determining the variation we observe
   among colonies. The reproductive unit of social insects, on which
   natural selection acts, is the colony, not individual workers.
   Therefore, it is important to understand what mechanisms govern the
   observed variation among colonies. Here I propose three hypotheses that
   address how consistent individual differences in the behavior of workers
   may lead to consistent individual differences in the behavior of
   colonies: 1. Colonies differ consistently in their average of worker
   personality; 2. The distribution but not the average of worker
   personalities varies consistently among colonies; and 3. Colony
   personality does not emerge from its worker personality composition but
   from consistent external constraints. I review evidence supporting each
   of these hypotheses and suggest methods to further investigate them. The
   study of how colony personality emerges from the personalities of the
   workers comprising them may shed light on the mechanisms underlying
   consistent individual differences in the behavior of other animals

Abstract = {{Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional
   stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory
   growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the
   level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet,
   compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in
   life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we
   tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory
   behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their
   exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2
   consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated
   with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural
   consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect
   exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory
   growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies
   from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on
   whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in
   elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with
   potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative
   strategies in different environmental conditions. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{This paper presents a behavioral ecologist's view on adaptive responses
   to early stress. I first summarize two approaches to this topic drawn
   from other papers in this Special Issue: the `inoculation model' and the
   `adaptive calibration model'. I then describe three relevant modeling
   approaches from behavioral and evolutionary ecology: models of adaptive
   plasticity, models of adaptive prey behavior under uncertainty about
   risk, and models of state-dependent adaptive behavioral syndromes. These
   models generate some novel predictions on factors that explain variation
   in how organisms might respond adaptively to early stress. In
   particular, the state-dependent models of adaptive behavioral syndromes
   emphasize the importance of feedback loops between behavior and state
   variables in explaining the long-term persistence of effects of early
   experiences. State variables can include aspects of physiology,
   morphology or life history, differences among individuals in information
   state or skill, or even in social state (e.g., social rank). The
   feedbacks between behavior and individual state suggest a framework for
   an integrative approach to understanding responses to stress. The
   behavioral syndrome approach also emphasizes the importance of
   understanding stress carryovers - e.g., situations where effects of one
   kind of stressor (e.g., early social stress) carry over to influence
   other stress responses (e.g., response to danger) later in life.
   Finally, I discuss how responses to early stress might relate to
   variation in the ability of animals to cope well with novel conditions
   associated with human-induced rapid environmental change, a ubiquitous
   problem that animals face in the modern world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Contest theory predicts the evolution of a stable mixture of different
   strategies for fighting. Here, we investigate the possibility that
   stable between-individual differences in startle-response durations
   influence fighting ability or `resource-holding potential' (RHP) in the
   beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina. Both winners and losers showed
   significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but
   mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual
   losers than for eventual winners, indicating that RHP varies with
   boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses
   inflicted more attacks on their opponent. Both repeatability and
   mean-level responses were changed by the experience of fighting, and
   these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was
   disrupted to a greater extent and the mean startle-response durations
   were subject to a greater increase than in winners. Thus, following a
   fight, this behavioural correlate of RHP behaves in a way similar to
   post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between
   winners and losers. Understanding the links between aggression and
   boldness therefore has the potential to enhance our understanding of
   both the evolution of animal personality and the `winner and loser
   effects' of post-fight changes in RHP.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models
   is that the errors have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedastic). When
   this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be
   biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95\%
   confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of
   homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological
   reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is
   likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature
   showed that only about 5\% of articles explicitly mentioned
   heteroscedasticity, leaving 95\% of articles in which heteroscedasticity
   was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the
   prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within
   behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of
   heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical
   examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism
   and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of
   considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers
   should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider
   what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce
   some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods
   we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a
   generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form
   of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard
   error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of
   heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both
   methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally,
   we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an
   important source of additional information about the particular
   biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to
   statistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of female mating preferences is central to the study of
   the evolution of male ornaments. Although several different methods have

   association with different males presented simultaneously. Sexual
   preference is then inferred from time spent in front of each male.
   However, the extent to which the measurement of female mate-choice is
   related to exploration tendencies has not been addressed so far. In the
   present study we assessed the influence of variation in exploration
   tendencies, a trait closely associated to global personality, on the
   measurement of female mating preference in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia
   guttata) using the widely used four-chamber choice-apparatus. The number
   of movements performed within both exploration and mate-choice apparatus
   was consistent within and across the two contexts. In addition,
   personality explained variation in selectivity, preference strength and
   consistency. High-exploratory females showed lower selectivity, lower
   preference scores and displayed more consistent preference scores. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality may affect the measurement
   of female mating preference and may contribute to explain existing
   inconsistencies across studies.}},

Abstract = {{The mouse, including countless lines of transgenic and knockout mice,
   has become the most prominent model organism in biomedical research.
   Behavioral characterization is often conducted in batteries of short
   tests on locomotion, anxiety, learning and memory, etc. In such tests,
   any individual differences within groups are usually considered to be
   disturbing variance. In order to reduce variance in experimental animal
   research enormous efforts of standardization have been made. While a
   substantial reduction of variability has been reached compared to the
   earlier years of experimental animal studies a considerable amount of
   inter-individual differences still seems to escape standardization. This
   effect is demonstrated and evaluated by re-analyzing data from two
   experiments conducted in our laboratory with inbred mice. Interestingly,
   behavioral patterns of individual animals seem to be correlated across
   context and time. In evolutionary biology, ``animal personalities'' have
   been discussed recently to comprise such stable patterns. We argue here,
   that nonrandom behavioral correlations across contexts and time might
   underlie the variability commonly found in biomedical mouse studies. (C)

Abstract = {{I explore the relationship between metabolism and personality by
   establishing how selection acts on metabolic rate and risk-taking in the
   context of a trade-off between energy and predation. Using a simple time
   budget model, I show that a high resting metabolic rate is not
   necessarily associated with a high daily energy expenditure. The
   metabolic rate that minimizes the time spent foraging does not maximize
   the net gain rate while foraging, and it is not always advantageous for
   animals to have a higher metabolic rate when food availability is high.
   A model based on minimizing the ratio of mortality rate to net gain rate
   is used to determine how a willingness to take risks should be
   correlated with metabolic rate. My results establish that it is not
   always advantageous for animals to take greater risks when metabolic
   rate is high. When foraging intensity and metabolic rate coevolve, I
   show that in a particular case different combinations of foraging
   intensity and metabolic rate can have equal fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral lateralization, the preferential use of one hemisphere of the
   brain to perform certain cognitive functions, is a widespread and
   evolutionarily ancient adaptation. Lateralization appears to enhance
   cognitive capacity, yet substantial individual variation in the strength
   cerebral lateralization is apparent in all species studied so far. It is
   puzzling that cerebral lateralization, a seemingly advantageous trait,
   has not been driven to fixation. It has been suggested that variation in
   lateralization may be linked to individual variation in behaviour, which
   itself may be subject to disruptive selection. We examined the relation
   between cerebral lateralization and individual variation in boldness in
   the convict cichlid, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. We show that convict
   cichlids that are more strongly lateralized when exploring a familiar
   environment, but not a novel one, are quicker to emerge from a shelter
   in a test for boldness. The possibility that cerebral lateralization is
   linked to life history strategy is discussed. (c) 2008 The Association

Abstract = {{The predator functional response (i.e. per capita consumption rate as a
   function of prey density) is central to our understanding of
   predator-prey population dynamics. This response is behavioural,
   depending on the rate of attack and time it takes to handle prey.
   Consistent behavioural differences among conspecific individuals, termed
   behavioural types, are a widespread feature of predator and prey
   populations but the effects of behavioural types on the functional
   response remain unexplored. We tested the effects of crab (Panopeus
   herbstii) behavioural type, specifically individual activity level, on
   the crab functional response to mussel (Brachidontes exustus) prey. We
   further tested whether the effects of activity level on the response are
   mediated by the presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat in
   the form of waterborne chemical cues known to reduce crab activity
   level. The effects of crab activity level on the functional response
   were dependent on crab body size. Individual activity level increased
   the magnitude (i.e. slope and asymptote) of the type II functional
   response of small crabs, potentially through an increase in time spent
   foraging, but had no effect on the functional response of large crabs.
   Predation threat did not interact with activity level to influence
   mussel consumption, but independently reduced the slope of the type II
   functional response. Overall, this study demonstrates size-specific
   effects of a behavioural type on a predator-prey interaction, as well as
   a general pathway (modification of the functional response) by which the
   effects of individual behavioural types can scale up to influence
   predator-prey population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions and physical constraints both influence an

   variation among colonies in responsiveness to food baits and to
   disturbance, measured as a change in numbers of active ants, and in the
   speed with which colonies retrieved food and removed debris. Colonies
   differed consistently, across foraging and disturbance situations, in
   both responsiveness and speed. Increased activity in response to food
   was associated with a smaller decrease in response to alarm. Speed of
   retrieving food was correlated with speed of removing debris. In all
   colonies, speed was greater in dry conditions, reducing the amount of
   time ants spent outside the nest. While a colony occupied a certain nest
   site, its responsiveness was consistent in both foraging and disturbance
   situations, suggesting that nest structure influences colony

Abstract = {{In recent years, using a personality approach for studies of animal
   behaviour has increased our ability to predict an individual's or
   population's behavioural responses to external stimuli. At a population
   level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and
   the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across
   different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a
   predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced
   changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural
   type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether
   exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness.
   We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally
   different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or
   contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural
   antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing
   (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types
   expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e.
   shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However,
   an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in
   either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses
   were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that
   individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased
   predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and
   that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food
   or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or
   genetic basis. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Classic theory on division of labor implicitly assumes that task
   specialists are more proficient at their jobs than generalists and
   specialists in other tasks; however, recent data suggest that this might
   not hold for societies that lack discrete worker polymorphisms, which
   constitute the vast majority of animal societies. The facultatively
   social spider Anelosimus studiosus lacks castes, but females exhibit
   either a ``docile{''} or ``aggressive{''} phenotype. Here we observed
   the propensity of individual females of either phenotype to perform
   various tasks (i.e., prey capture, web building, parental care, and
   colony defense) in mixed-phenotype colonies. We then measured the
   performance outcomes of singleton individuals of either phenotype at
   each task to determine their proficiencies. Aggressive females
   participated more in prey capture, web building, and colony defense,
   whereas docile females engaged more in parental care. In staged trials,
   aggressive individuals were more effective at capturing prey,
   constructing webs, and defending the colony, whereas docile females were
   more effective at rearing large quantities of brood. Thus, individuals'
   propensity to perform tasks and their task proficiencies appear to be
   adaptively aligned in this system. Moreover, because the
   docile/aggressive phenotypes are heritable, these data suggest that
   within-colony variation is maintained because of advantages gleaned by
   division of labor.}},

Title = {{Sex and boldness explain individual differences in spatial learning in a

Volume = {{281}},

Abstract = {{Understanding individual differences in cognitive performance is a major
   challenge to animal behaviour and cognition studies. We used the Eastern
   water skink (Eulamprus quoyii) to examine associations between
   exploration, boldness and individual variability in spatial learning, a
   dimension of lizard cognition with important bearing on fitness. We show
   that males perform better than females in a biologically relevant
   spatial learning task. This is the first evidence for sex differences in
   learning in a reptile, and we argue that it is probably owing to
   sex-specific selective pressures that may be widespread in lizards.
   Across the sexes, we found a clear association between boldness after a
   simulated predatory attack and the probability of learning the spatial
   task. In contrast to previous studies, we found a nonlinear association
   between boldness and learning: both `bold' and `shy' behavioural types
   were more successful learners than intermediate males. Our results do
   not fit with recent predictions suggesting that individual differences
   in learning may be linked with behavioural types via
   high-low-risk/reward trade-offs. We suggest the possibility that
   differences in spatial cognitive performance may arise in lizards as a
   consequence of the distinct environmental variability and complexity
   experienced by individuals as a result of their sex and social tactics.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing behavioural consistency is crucial to understand the evolution
   of personality traits. In the present study, we examined the short- and
   long-term repeatability and stability of two unrelated personality
   traits exploratory tendencies and struggling rate using captive female
   zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental
   sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up
   to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that,
   overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly
   repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were
   repeatable in the long term. We found interindividual differences in
   short-term stability of exploratory tendencies, but not struggling rate,
   providing evidence for differences in intraindividual variability. In
   the long term, struggling rate significantly decreased between the two
   experimental sessions, whereas exploratory tendencies remained stable.
   Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both
   sessions did not differ. Our results suggest that short- and long-term
   repeatability and stability of personality may vary between individuals,
   depending on the behavioural trait under scrutiny. As a consequence,
   deducing personality from measures realized earlier in a subject's life
   should be performed with caution. We discuss the implications of inter-
   and intraindividual variation in personality consistency on individual
   fitness.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The arms race between predators and prey has led to morphological and
   behavioral adaptations. Different antipredator strategies can coexist
   within a population if each strategy is the result of a trade-off with
   competing demands. Antipredator behavior can be associated with
   morphological traits, like color patterns, either because in the context
   of sexual selection, coloration signals the ability to avoid predators
   or because coloration is a naturally selected trait useful in avoiding
   predators. Because in the barn owl (Tyto alba), heritable eumelanic
   plumage coloration is associated with the glucocorticoid-dependent
   response to stress, we tested whether antipredator behavior is also
   related to this trait. Compared with small-spotted nestlings,
   individuals displaying larger black spots hissed more intensely in the
   presence of humans, feigned death longer, had a lower breathing rate
   under stress, and were more docile when handled. Cross-fostering
   experiments showed that the covariation between the spot size and the
   duration of feigning death was inherited from the biological mother,
   whereas covariation between spot size and docility was inherited from
   the biological father. Our results confirm that melanin-based coloration
   is associated with suites of behavioral traits, which are under both
   genetic and environmental influence. Coloration can thus evolve as a
   direct or indirect response to predation, but it can also be a signal of
   antipredator strategies to potential mates.}},

Abstract = {{Recently emerged brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) foraging in
   still-water pools along the sides of streams tend to be sedentary,
   feeding from the lower portion of the water column (sitting and
   waiting), or active, feeding from the upper portion of the water column
   (active search). Individuals exhibiting intermediate behavior are
   observed less frequently. We assessed the perceptual, energetic, and
   locomotor bases of the individual differences in foraging tactics by
   testing whether an individual's activity while searching for prey in the
   field was linked to its willingness to take risks, resting metabolic
   rate (RMR), and swimming capacity. Proportion of time an individual
   spent moving during prey search was quantified in the field, the
   individual was captured, and willingness to take risks (field), resting
   oxygen consumption (lab), and locomotor ability (lab) were measured.
   Individuals that spent a lesser proportion of time moving in the field
   took longer to exit from a dark tube into an unfamiliar field
   environment, and delayed their exit times more in response to a novel
   object, than did individuals that spent a greater proportion of time
   moving in the field. Proportion of time spent moving in the field was
   unrelated to resting oxygen consumption and swimming capacity measured
   in the laboratory. Dispositions in foraging behavior and risk taking
   early in life could influence encounter rates with novel prey and
   habitats, which are important steps in the initial stages of resource
   polymorphisms.}},

Abstract = {{Although personality has been documented in numerous animals and
   characters, research into personality-dependent spatial ecology has
   focused on dispersal. Indeed, few authors have investigated the role of
   other important spatial traits such as home range, movement distance,
   vertical activity, and site fidelity, and it is not clear whether these
   behaviors are correlated with dispersal. In this study, we investigated
   individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical
   activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota
   lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian
   mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met
   the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior:
   repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of
   pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then
   tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors,
   indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable,
   cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range,
   movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast,
   behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across
   sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our
   data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from
   dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from
   ``resident{''} individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity,
   and minimal movement to ``mobile{''} individuals with large home ranges,
   high movement rates, and little site fidelity. Our findings suggest
   animal personality can play a key role in shaping the space use of
   individuals, and this diversity in spatial behaviors may be too complex
   to be captured by often used simple linear measures of dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Human and nonhuman animals show personality: temporal and contextual
   consistency in behavior patterns that vary among individuals. In
   contrast to most other species, personality of chimpanzees, Pan
   troglodytes, has mainly been studied with non-behavioral methods. We
   examined boldness, exploration tendency, persistence and
   tool-orientation in 29 captive chimpanzees using repeated experiments
   conducted in an ecologically valid social setting. High temporal
   repeatability and contextual consistency in all these traits indicated
   they reflected personality. In addition, Principal Component Analysis
   revealed two independent syndromes, labeled exploration-persistence and
   boldness. We found no sex or rank differences in the trait scores, but
   the scores declined with age. Nonetheless, there was considerable
   inter-individual variation within age-classes, suggesting that behavior
   was not merely determined by age but also by dispositional effects. In
   conclusion, our study complements earlier rating studies and adds new
   traits to the chimpanzee personality, thereby supporting the existence
   of multiple personality traits among chimpanzees. We stress the
   importance of ecologically valid behavioral research to assess multiple
   personality traits and their association, as it allows inclusion of ape
   studies in the comparison of personality structures across species
   studied behaviorally, and furthers our attempts to unravel the causes
   and consequences of animal personality. Am. J. Primatol. 75:947-958,

Abstract = {{Interest has been growing among behavioral biologists in individual
   differences in animal behavior of the kind that can be considered to
   reflect differences in personality. Once considered the exclusive domain
   of human psychology, biologists have found evidence for personality
   across a wide range of species, while behavioral ecologist and
   theoretical biologists recognize the likely evolutionary origins and
   contribution to fitness of such. However, until recently most work has
   concentrated on ultimate questions of fitness and thus on adult animals,
   with little attention given to proximate, developmental origins. This is
   now changing, as approaches to studying animal personality broaden and
   methodologies are developed enabling this to be studied across periods
   of near continuous and often rapid ontogenetic change. Debate continues,
   however, about the right methodologies to characterize the phenomenon
   and attempt to do so in a comparable manner across taxa that differ as
   widely in the expression of ``personality'' as insects and mammals. This
   makes it necessary to discuss this field in an interdisciplinary context
   among psychologists and biologists, and was the rational for a meeting
   on ``The Emergence of Personality in Animals'' held in May 2010 at the
   Center for Interdisciplinary Research (Zentrum fur Interdisziplinare
   Forschung; ZiF), Bielefeld, Germany. The diversity of topics, viewpoints
   and organisms covered and the excitement created by the ensuing
   discussions is reflected in the resulting collection of papers forming

Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ in their behavioural reactions to the
   environment. Consistent individual differences in these behaviours
   (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural
   selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in
   physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation
   in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in
   several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for
   personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in
   controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological
   differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might
   cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying
   these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma
   testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced
   immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially
   selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow'
   exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly
   repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the
   season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently
   higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than
   `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for
   variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in
   hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels
   do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels.
   Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of
   selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms
   and the phenotypic traits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {{ANIMAL COGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{165-178}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive processes are important to animals because they not only
   influence how animals acquire, store and recall information, but also
   may underpin behaviours such as deciding where to look for food, build a
   nest, or with whom to mate. Several recent studies have begun to examine
   the potential interaction between variation in cognition and variation
   in personality traits. One hypothesis proposed that there is a
   speed-accuracy trade-off in cognition ability that aligns with a
   fast-slow behaviour type. Here, we explicitly examined this hypothesis
   by testing wild-caught black-capped chickadees in a series of cognitive
   tasks that assessed both learning speed (the number of trials taken to
   learn) and accuracy (post-acquisition performance when tested with
   un-trained exemplars). Chickadees' exploration scores were measured in a
   novel environment task. We found that slow-exploring chickadees
   demonstrated higher accuracy during the test phase, but did not learn
   the initial task in fewer trials compared to fast-exploring chickadees,
   providing partial support for the proposed link between cognition and
   personality. We report positive correlations in learning speed between
   different phases within cognitive tasks, but not between the three
   cognitive tasks suggesting independence in underlying cognitive
   processing. We discuss different rule-based strategies that may
   contribute to differential performance accuracy in cognitive tasks and
   provide suggestions for future experimentation to examine mechanisms
   underlying the relationship between cognition and personality.}},

Title = {{Bolder stickleback fish make faster decisions, but they are not less

Abstract = {{There have been many investigations into consistent, individual
   differences in behavior (animal personalities), but rather less
   attention has been given to the possibility that individuals might
   differ consistently in their ``cognitive style,{''} which refers to the
   way information is acquired, processed, stored, or acted on. Both
   personality and cognition have important fitness consequences, and it
   has been proposed that variation in cognition could be functionally
   related to variation in personality. Here, we test this hypothesis using
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model and adopt
   a classic T-maze with food reward experimental paradigm. We first
   confirmed that fish choose the correct arm of the maze significantly
   more than would be expected by chance and that this improves with trial
   number. We then explored predictors of individual differences in the
   speed (time to making a decision) and accuracy (whether the first
   decision is correct) in decision making. We find bolder behavioral types
   (who tend to be male) arrive at the correct decision sooner than their
   shyer conspecifics. However, boldness was not related to decision
   accuracy. Moreover, we did not find any significant difference in fish's
   improvement in decision accuracy over successive trials according to
   boldness or sex. This suggests that although bolder fish may acquire
   information more quickly because they make decisions faster, they do not
   differ from shyer conspecifics in their decision-making accuracy. The
   absence of such a trade-off might offer a functional explanation for
   why, in stickleback fish and many other species, bolder individuals tend
   to initiate movement and shyer individuals to follow-bold leaders may
   result in faster group decisions without compromising accuracy.}},

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{131-139}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The role of ontogenetic processes for the emergence of personality has
   received only little attention in the past. One reason for the lack of
   experimental studies on personality development may be that trait
   consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of the definition of
   animal personality, whereas, also by definition, ontogeny deals with
   change over time. Single traits or correlations between traits may be
   consistent or inconsistent throughout ontogeny; however, the proximate
   and ultimate causes are not well understood. Environmental factors
   acting upon individuals during early ontogeny potentially influence
   personality development substantially. Early environments may severely
   constrain but also adaptively shape individuals. We examined the
   personality development of cavies, Cavia aperea, when exposed to
   increasing and decreasing photoperiod before and after birth. We
   determined how these predictive environmental cues influenced the
   development of three behavioural and two physiological traits, their
   temporal consistency and the correlations between them. We found
   remarkable plasticity in the development of personality in the cavy,
   despite a relatively high degree of temporal consistency in most traits.
   There were stable correlations, some of which became tighter over time,
   between basal cortisol levels, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness
   across two different ontogenetic stages. However, we also found that
   some correlations emerged only after maturation or disappeared over
   time. Whereas exploration behaviour was tightly correlated with basal
   cortisol and boldness was correlated with resting metabolic rate, both
   correlations disappeared in mature animals. Instead, a correlation
   between exploration and boldness was evident in mature animals. These
   results call for a broader incorporation of developmental aspects into
   personality research. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The evolution and maintenance of consistent individual differences, so
   called animal personalities, have attracted much research interest over
   the past decades. Variation along common personality traits, such as
   boldness or exploration, is often associated with risk-reward
   trade-offs. Individuals that are bolder and hence take more risks may be
   more successful in acquiring resources over the short term. Cautious
   individuals taking fewer risks may, on the other hand, live longer, but
   may also gather fewer resources over the short term. According to recent
   theory, individual differences in personality may be functionally
   related to individual differences in cognitive performance (i.e., the
   way in which individuals acquire or use information). Individual
   differences in the acquisition speed of cognitively challenging tasks
   are often associated with a speed-accuracy trade-off. Accuracy can be
   improved by investing more time in the decision-making process or,
   conversely, decisions can be made more quickly at the cost of making
   more mistakes. Hence, the speed-accuracy trade-off often involves a
   risk-reward trade-off. We tested whether 3 personality traits, boldness,
   activity, and aggressiveness, are correlated with individual learning,
   associative learning speed, and behavioral flexibility as assessed by
   reversal learning in wild cavies (Cavia aperea). We found strong
   positive relationships between all personality traits and learning
   speed, whereas flexibility was negatively associated with
   aggressiveness. Our results support the hypothesis that performance
   reflects individual differences in personality in a predictable way.}},

Abstract = {{Although animal behavior is generally repeatable, most behavioral
   variation apparently occurs within rather than across individuals. With
   the exception of very recent interest in individual behavioral
   plasticity (consistent differences in responsiveness), this
   within-individual variation has been largely ignored despite its
   importance in the study of proximate and ultimate questions about
   behavior. Here, we repeatedly scored the undisturbed activity of 30
   adult male mosquitofish across multiple observation bouts spanning 132
   days (n = 37 observations per fish). We found that the behavior of some
   individuals was consistently more predictable in a given context than
   others. Repeatability for this `` intraindividual variation{''} (IIV; r
   = 0.29) was evident after accounting for individual differences in
   activity trends across days, and activity responses due to fine-scale
   temperature variation (i. e., individual plasticity in response to both
   variables). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that
   predictability of behavior is a repeatable characteristic of individual
   animals. We suggest that IIV represents an important axis of consistent
   behavioral variation that has previously not been formally considered.
   Finally, individual differences in predictability may similarly exist
   for labile morphological and physiological traits but have seemingly not
   been studied.}},

Abstract = {{Species comparisons of personality structure (i.e., how many personality
   dimensions and the characteristics of those dimensions) can facilitate
   questions about the adaptive function of personality in nonhuman
   primates. Here we investigate personality structure in the brown
   capuchin monkey (Sapajus apella), a New World primate species, and
   compare this structure to those of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),
   orangutans (Pongo spp.), and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Brown
   capuchins evolved behavioral and cognitive traits that are qualitatively
   similar to those of great apes, and individual differences in behavior
   and cognition often reflect differences in personality. Thus, we
   hypothesized that brown capuchin personality structure would overlap
   more with great apes than with rhesus macaques. We obtained personality
   ratings from seven sites, including 127 brown capuchin monkeys.
   Principal-components analysis identified five personality dimensions
   (Assertiveness, Openness, Neuroticism, Sociability, and Attentiveness),
   which were reliable across raters and, in a subset of subjects,
   significantly correlated with relevant behaviors up to a year later.
   Comparisons between species revealed that brown capuchins and great apes
   overlapped in personality structure, particularly chimpanzees in the
   case of Neuroticism. However, in some respects (i.e., capuchin
   Sociability and Openness) the similarities between capuchins and great
   apes were not significantly greater than those between capuchins and
   rhesus macaques. We discuss the relevance of our results to brown
   capuchin behavior and the evolution of personality structure in
   primates.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities have become an established concept in animal
   behaviour. Despite this, the potential influence of early life
   experiences on adult personality is often overlooked. Juvenile exposure
   to environmental cues such as conspecific signalling or predator cues
   may provide relevant information regarding the make-up of the
   forthcoming environment. Individuals might be able to use these cues to
   adjust developmental trajectory and adult personality to prevent a
   personality-environment mismatch. Using the field cricket Gryllus
   integer, we show that individuals reared in the presence of conspecific
   acoustic sexual signals alter both growth rate and an adult personality
   trait. Males reared in the presence of acoustic sexual signals were less
   aggressive and less likely to become dominant relative to those reared
   in the absence of acoustic signals. Additionally, acoustic treatment
   interacted with juvenile body mass: large juveniles reared in the
   presence of acoustic signals were larger than small juveniles reared in
   the presence of acoustic signals and larger than all juveniles reared in
   silence. We discuss the potential adaptive significance of the observed
   developmental and personality differences. (C) 2012 The Association for

Abstract = {{Studies on metabolism usually rely on measurements of oxygen consumption
   obtained in respirometry chambers. Despite rigorous standardization
   there is still considerable inter-individual variation in metabolic
   rates which is often ignored. Furthermore, housing in respirometry
   chambers implies handling and exposure to a new environment, conditions
   known to be a source of stress in animals. The extent of stress response
   is known to be dependent on an individual's coping style. Therefore, the
   extent of individual variation in respirometry data may be related to
   the expression of coping styles. The goal of this study is to determine
   whether the variation in oxygen consumption after a stressor is the
   resultant of an individual's coping style. Our approach was to determine
   oxygen consumption in fish immediately after transfer to respiratory
   chambers and during the subsequent 22 h. In addition, the same
   individuals were subjected to 3 respirometry runs (22 h each) to address
   the question whether habituation occurs when fish are used in multiple
   runs and whether habituation potential is linked to coping styles. The
   same individuals were then subjected to an acute stressor and the escape
   behaviour and plasma cortisol were determined to assess coping style.
   Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that individual
   variation in oxygen consumption in respirometry chambers are related to
   the expression of coping styles: individuals with higher oxygen
   consumption at the start and throughout the measurement period were
   shown to react passively (longer latency to escape) in a confinement
   stress. In addition, successive respirometry runs should not be assumed
   to result in habituation, as depending on an individual's coping style
   either habituation (in the case of passive copers) or sensitization (in
   the case of active copers) can occur. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{1. Many aspects of animal behaviour differ consistently between
   individuals, giving rise to the growing field of animal personality
   research. While between-individual variation has long been of interest
   to biologists, the role of within-individual variation has received less
   attention. Indeed, many models assume that the extent of
   within-individual variation is the same across individuals despite the
   fact that individuals may often differ in their variability. Recently,
   the importance of within-individual variability or predictability has
   been recognized within the field of animal behaviour. However, there is
   a lack of a consensus on how best to quantify it. This situation, in
   turn, has led to the development of a variety of different methods aimed
   at assessing how variable or predictable different individuals are.
   Here, we review the indices that have been proposed as proxies of
   individual predictability. We then introduce existing techniques called
   hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) and double-hierarchical
   generalized linear models (DHGLMs) as general tools for quantifying
   predictability. HGLMs and DHGLMs are extensions of random intercept
   mixed models that exploit the fact that variation in variances as well
   as variation in means can be modelled within a single overarching
   framework. Explicit modelling of the within-individual residual
   variation by (D)HGLMs makes more efficient use of the data, performs
   better on unbalanced data sets and captures more of the uncertainty
   involved in modelling within-individual variation than other proposed
   indices. In addition, (D)HGLMs yield an estimator of population-wide
   variation in predictability, which can serve as a standardized effect
   size for comparisons across traits and studies. We call this estimator
   CVP, the coefficient of variation in predictability. The different
   methods described here and the standardized effect size CVP should open
   new avenues for studying individuality in animal behaviour. Since sound
   understanding of individual variation is central to many studies in
   ecology and evolution, these methods have wide application both in the
   field of animal personality research and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities range from individuals that are shy, cautious, and
   easily stressed (a ``reactive{''} personality type) to individuals that
   are bold, innovative, and quick to learn novel tasks, but also prone to
   routine formation (a ``proactive{''} personality type). Although
   personality differences should have important consequences for fitness,
   their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we
   investigated how genetic variation in brain size affects personality. We
   put selection lines of large- and small-brained guppies (Poecilia
   reticulata), with known differences in cognitive ability, through three
   standard personality assays. First, we found that large-brained animals
   were faster to habituate to, and more exploratory in, open field tests.
   Large-brained females were also bolder. Second, large-brained animals
   excreted less cortisol in a stressful situation (confinement). Third,
   large-brained animals were slower to feed from a novel food source,
   which we interpret as being caused by reduced behavioral flexibility
   rather than lack of innovation in the large-brained lines. Overall, the
   results point toward a more proactive personality type in large-brained
   animals. Thus, this study provides the first experimental evidence
   linking brain size and personality, an interaction that may affect
   important fitness-related aspects of ecology such as dispersal and niche
   exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent behavioural differences have long been recognized in animals
   but it still remains unclear how these traits change over ontogeny. As
   individuals can face different situations over their lives, and their
   life history expectation may not be the same in different life stages,
   one can expect that using different strategies in different life stages
   would be advantageous. Characteristics of animal personality across
   ontogeny could be measured at group and individual levels. Since
   personality alteration across time can be studied from various aspects
   one should use the following indexes: mean-level, differential,
   structural and individual consistency. We investigated whether common
   firebugs behave in the same way through a major life stage transition,
   namely final ecdysis. We measured activity, boldness and exploration
   twice in the larval stage and also twice when bugs reached the adult
   stage. We found that the relative value of behavioural traits was stable
   across ontogeny and the correlation structure among behavioural traits
   remained constant over time. Nevertheless, larvae differed from adults
   in general in that they were bolder, explored their environment more
   thoroughly and seemed to be more active before final ecdysis. These
   results indicate that personality could change differently across major
   life stage transitions; therefore this important factor needs to be
   considered in further research. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study

   three general themes within the behavioral syndromes literature for

   behavioral trait variants have on interspecific interactions and (3)
   mechanisms that aid in maintaining behavioral variation within- and

Abstract = {{The concept that animals have personalities is gaining traction in the
   scientific community and is well established in zoos and aquariums.
   Applying knowledge of animal personalities has occurred more slowly and
   is most often only considered informally. However, animal personalities
   are likely to affect the welfare animals experience in captivity and
   thus should be of primary concern to zoo managers. In addition, animal
   personality likely affects the outcomes of zoo guest experiences and
   potentially guests' conservation-related behavior. With over 1,000,000
   animals in the care of zoos internationally and hundreds of millions of
   visitors annually, it would be prudent and beneficial to maximize our
   use of animal personality data in zoos to effect positive conservation
   outcomes. Understanding how to broaden population planning techniques to
   include measures of animal personality and the important outcomes of
   welfare and education value is of prime importance to the zoo industry.
   In order to succeed, it is necessary to employ techniques that reliably
   assess animal personalities and provide measures that can easily be used
   in population planning models. discuss the outcomes of recent workshops
   designed to determine the best techniques for measuring animal
   personalities in the zoo setting with the goal of incorporating

Abstract = {{Consistent differences in behaviour, termed behavioural types (BTs) are
   well documented in the animal kingdom. Relatively little is known,
   however, about how and why consistency is maintained within populations.
   In recent years, theoretical work suggests that life history trade-offs
   may be an important mechanism driving the maintenance of interindividual
   variation in BTs. We used a laboratory population of a clonal
   vertebrate, the mangrove killifish, as a model organism. This fish is an
   internally self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodite that exhibits
   within-genotype homozygosity. We utilized 20 genotypes to examine BT
   plasticity (boldness and exploration), the development of behavioural
   correlations, and relationships between life history strategy and BTs at
   five age points during ontogeny. We found that BT scores increased
   during early ontogeny and reached an asymptote near sexual maturity. We
   also found considerable variation in BT developmental plasticity at the
   genotype level. Moreover, although genotypes exhibited high levels of
   plasticity in BTs, strong, significant positive correlations between
   exploration and boldness emerged from day 61 onwards. Furthermore, we
   observed no difference between genotypes in growth rate and growth was
   unrelated to BTs. Contrary to our predictions, we found that while
   genotypes differed in their age at first reproduction and reproductive
   output, these differences were unrelated to BT expression prior to and
   following sexual maturity. We discuss these results in relation to
   mechanisms proposed to drive interindividual variation in BTs and we
   highlight the potential of the mangrove killifish as a model organism
   for animal personality studies. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study

Volume = {{103}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in the way animals cope with stressors has been
   documented in a number of animal groups. In general, two distinct sets
   of behavioural and physiological responses to stress have been
   described: the proactive and the reactive coping styles. Some
   characteristics of stress coping style seem to be coupled to the time to
   emerge of fry from spawning redds in natural populations of salmonid
   fishes. In the present study, behavioural and physiological traits of
   stress coping styles were compared two and five months after emergence
   in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), using individuals with an early
   or late time to emerge. Initially, compared to late emerging
   individuals, early emerging individuals showed a shorter time to resume
   feeding after transfer to rearing in isolation. Resumption of feeding
   after isolation was suggested to be related to boldness behaviour,
   rather than hunger, in the present study. This observation was repeated
   five months after emergence, demonstrating behavioural consistency over
   time in this trait. However, in other traits of proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles, such as social status, resting metabolism or post
   stress cortisol concentrations, early and late emerging individuals did
   not differ. Therefore, this study demonstrates that boldness in a novel
   environment is uncoupled from other traits of the proactive and reactive
   stress coping styles in farmed salmonids. It is possible that this
   decoupling is caused by the low competitive environment in which fish
   were reared. In natural populations of salmonids, however, the higher
   selection pressure at emergence could select for early emerging
   individuals with a proactive coping style. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{Although in recent years behavioral syndromes have received a wealth of
   attention, how traits within syndromes respond to changing environments
   is not well resolved. Here, we test the effects of temperature on a
   suite of behavioral traits in the spider Anelosimus studiosus to
   determine (1) whether there are shifts in individuals' social tendency,
   activity level, and foraging behavior in response to temperature, (2) if
   these traits shift are in the direction predicted by within-population
   axes of trait covariance, and (3) whether the effects of temperature
   differ among individuals. In previous work, we documented a behavioral
   syndrome in A. studiosus where increased tolerance of conspecifics is
   correlated with decreased activity level and aggressiveness toward prey.
   Furthermore, there are distinct among-population differences in
   behavior, where individuals from warm sites tend to be more aggressive
   and active than individuals from cold sites. Our data here reveal that
   at warmer temperatures A. studiosus exhibit diminished tolerance of
   conspecifics, increased activity levels, shorter latencies of attack,
   and increased tendencies to attack multiple prey items. Furthermore, we
   found that individual differences in behavior were consistent across
   temperature regimes for the majority of behavioral traits considered
   here: social tendency, activity level, and latency of attack. These
   findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these behaviors are
   linked together by shared genetic underpinnings (e.g., metabolic
   differences) and shift non-independently in response to contemporary
   abiotic environment (i.e., temperature). Furthermore, our data suggest
   that temperature itself could be responsible for the among-population
   variation in social structure in A. studiosus.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in animal behaviour is nearly ubiquitous
   and has important ecological and evolutionary implications.
   Additionally, suites of behavioural traits are often correlated, forming
   behavioural syndromes in both humans and other species. Such syndromes
   are often described by testing for variation in traits across commonly
   described dimensions (e. g. aggression and neophobia), independent of
   whether this variation is ecologically relevant to the focal species.
   Here, we use a variety of ecologically relevant behavioural traits to
   test for a colony-level behavioural syndrome in rock ants (Temnothorax
   rugatulus). Specifically, we combine field and laboratory assays to
   measure foraging effort, how colonies respond to different types of
   resources, activity level, response to threat and aggression level. We
   find evidence for a colony level syndrome that suggests colonies
   consistently differ in coping style-some are more risk-prone, whereas
   others are more risk-averse. Additionally, by collecting data across the
   North American range of this species, we show that environmental
   variation may affect how different populations maintain consistent
   variation in colony behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{When several personality traits covary, they form a behavioral syndrome.
   Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a behavioral syndrome
   requires knowledge of its genetic underpinning. At present, our
   understanding of the genetic basis of behavioral syndromes is largely
   restricted to domestic and laboratory animals. Wild behavioral syndromes
   are mostly inferred on the basis of phenotypic correlations, and thus
   make the ``phenotypic gambit{''} of assuming that these phenotypic
   correlations capture the underlying genetic correlations. On the basis
   of 3 years of reciprocal cross-fostering of 2896 nestlings of 271
   families within a pedigreed population, we show that the nestling
   personality traits handling aggression, breathing rate, and docility are
   heritable (h(2) = 16-29\%), and often have a pronounced
   ``nest-of-rearing{''} variance component (10-15\%), but a relatively
   small ``nest-of-origin{''} variance component (0-7\%). The three
   nestling personality traits form a behavioral syndrome on the phenotypic
   and genetic level. Overall, the phenotypic correlations provide a
   satisfactory description of the genetic ones, but significantly
   underestimate the magnitude of one of the pairwise genetic correlations,
   which mirrors the conclusion based on domestic and laboratory studies.}},

Abstract = {{Flight initiation distances (FIDs) of animals approached by a potential
   predator provide information about the risk that individuals are willing
   to take given their state and the environment. Species differ in mean
   and variance in FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in
   FID have individuals that take either small or great risks, whereas
   species with a small variance are composed of individuals that are
   homogeneous in their risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the
   correlations between interspecific variance in risk-taking behavior and
   habitat selection, breeding range and population size, dispersal, and
   life history. Greater between individual variation in risk-taking
   behavior for a given average level of risk taking would imply that more
   different habitats could be exploited, resulting in larger local and
   global population sizes and larger ranges. There should be a link
   between dispersal distances and FID because individuals of risk-averse
   species should encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable
   breeding habitats. High local and global population sizes should select
   for fast life histories with early age at first reproduction, high
   annual fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of senescence in
   species with variable FIDs. Finally, a greater diversity of habitat use
   should select for a longer reproductive season in species with more
   variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of birds revealed
   results largely consistent with these predictions. Because risk taking
   correlates with other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome
   behavioral syndromes can play an important role in producing ecological
   syndromes (i.e., correlations between ecological traits).}},

Abstract = {{Individuals respond differently to stressors and it has been suggested
   that stress responses are related to coping styles (consistent
   individual differences in behavior and physiology). We studied
   behavioral responses to a novel object and corticosterone response to
   stress during chick rearing in free-living female house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus). To prevent mates from influencing each others' behavior, we
   removed the males temporarily from nests and tested the females the
   following day either with a novel object placed on the nest box or as
   control. The two groups differed only in behaviors that were a priori
   defined as responses to the novel object (latency to first feeding, time
   spent near the nest, and inspecting the novel object by hovering in
   front of it) indicating that mate-removal per se had no effect on female
   behavior. Based on these variables, females' coping behaviors were
   categorized as `bold', `inquisitive' or `shy' by discriminant analysis.
   Baseline corticosterone, measured on the day following the novel-object
   or control test, was not related to any measure of coping.
   Stress-induced corticosterone, however, was negatively related to number
   of hoverings in front of the nest (a measure of explorativeness) and
   accordingly differed between the behavioral coping categories, with
   `inquisitive' birds having the lowest stress response. We propose that
   the relationship between physiological stress response and behavioral
   response to novelty (a component of personality or coping style) may be
   more complex than previously suggested, and individuals cannot always be
   unambiguously categorized along a single personality axis.}},

Abstract = {{Individual hormone profiles can be important generators of phenotypic
   variation. Despite this, work on the consequences of hormone profiles
   has traditionally ignored the large inter-individual variation within
   natural populations. However, recent research has advocated the need to
   explicitly consider this variation and address its consequences for
   selection. One of the key steps in this process is examining
   repeatability in hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits
   under selection. In this study we show that individuals within a
   free-ranging population of the Australian lizard Egemia whitii exhibit
   temporal repeatability in their circulating baseline testosterone
   concentrations as well as their aggressive response towards conspecific
   intruders. Furthermore, we show significant, sex-specific links between
   testosterone and aggression. Specifically, testosterone and aggression
   is negatively linked in males, while there is no relationship in
   females. As conspecific aggression has significant consequences for
   fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in this
   species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations,
   through their effects on aggression, could have important implications
   for individual fitness. We discuss the potential causes and consequences
   of hormonal repeatability as well as provide explanations for its
   sex-specific links with aggression. Specifically, we suggest that these
   patterns are the result of alternative hormonal pathways governing
   aggression within Egemia and may indicate a decoupling of aggression and
   testosterone across the sexes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related
   behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic
   manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two
   trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the
   behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a
   behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the
   correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural
   traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted:
   phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical
   distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect
   on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods
   infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly,
   amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural
   correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts.
   Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected
   amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these
   results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of consistent inter-individual differences in behavior
   ({''}animal personalities'') {[}1, 2] suggests that they might play a
   fundamental role in driving the movements and functioning of animal
   groups {[}3, 4], including their collective decision-making, foraging
   performance, and predator avoidance. Despite increasing evidence that
   highlights their importance {[}5-16], we still lack a unified
   mechanistic framework to explain and to predict how consistent
   inter-individual differences may drive collective behavior. Here we
   investigate how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and
   foraging performance of groups can emerge from inter-individual
   differences by high-resolution tracking of known behavioral types in
   free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) shoals. We show that
   individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a classic
   ``sociability'' assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a
   range of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership
   within groups as well as differences in structure and movement dynamics
   between groups. In turn, this trait, together with individual's
   exploratory tendency, measured by a classic ``boldness'' assay,
   explained individual and group foraging performance. These effects of
   consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged
   naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of
   individuals differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides
   experimental and theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain
   the emergence of collective behavior from consistent individual
   differences, including variation in the structure, leadership, movement
   dynamics, and functional capabilities of groups, across social and
   ecological scales. In addition, we demonstrate individual performance is
   conditional on group composition, indicating how social selection may
   drive behavioral differentiation between individuals.}},

Abstract = {{We review the evidence for a link between consistent among-individual
   variation in behaviour (animal personality) and the ability to win
   contests over limited resources. Explorative and bold behaviours often
   covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence
   that the structure of these `behavioural syndromes' can change across
   situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject
   to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic
   responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common
   proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic
   rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general
   personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of
   fighting and of personality, we suggest that longitudinal studies of
   contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, would
   be a useful context for the study of animal personalities.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often show consistent differences in risk-taking behaviours;
   behaviours that increase resource acquisition at the expense of an
   increased risk of mortality. Recently, basal metabolic rate (BMR) has
   been suggested as a potentially important state variable underlying
   adaptive individual differences in a range of behaviours, including
   risk-taking. We tested the relationship between BMR and risk-taking in
   free-living great tits (Parus major) using experimental manipulations of
   perceived predation risk. We compared the latency of individuals to
   return to feeders following control (human) and predator (model
   sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus) disturbances at fixed feeder locations. We
   predicted that if variation in risk-taking is shaped by energetic
   constraints, high BMR individuals should return to feeders sooner
   following both disturbance types and show smaller changes in risk-taking
   as a function of predation danger. Higher BMR tended to be associated
   with lower risk-taking following control disturbances but greater
   risk-taking following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant
   interaction between BMR and treatment. Within-individual changes in
   risk-taking as a function of ambient temperature (a proxy for
   within-individual changes in energetic constraints) mirrored these
   results. Lower temperatures tended to be associated with lower
   risk-taking following control disturbances, but greater risk-taking
   following predator disturbances, resulting in a significant interaction
   between temperature and treatment. The effects of BMR and temperature on
   variation in risk-taking as a function of perceived predation danger
   were qualitatively similar, suggesting that energetic constraints play a
   role in shaping risk-taking. However, the hypothesized mechanism
   (energetic requirements directly influence the optimal expression of
   risk-taking behaviour) is insufficient to account for the observed
   negative relationship between energetic constraint and risk-taking
   following control disturbances. We conclude that variation in
   risk-taking is associated with differences in energetic constraints,
   including BMR and temperature, but that the relationship is
   context-specific, here high vs. low perceived predation risk. Further
   studies are needed to elucidate potential mechanisms that could generate
   context-specific relationships between energetic constraints and
   risk-taking.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Despite a growing body of evidence linking personality to life-history
   variation and fitness, the behavioural mechanisms underlying these
   relationships remain poorly understood. One mechanism thought to play a
   key role is how individuals respond to risk. Relatively reactive and
   proactive (or shy and bold) personality types are expected to differ in
   how they manage the inherent trade-off between productivity and
   survival, with bold individuals being more risk-prone with lower
   survival probability, and shy individuals adopting a more risk-averse
   strategy. In the great tit (Parus major), the shy-bold personality axis
   has been well characterized in captivity and linked to fitness. Here, we
   tested whether `exploration behaviour', a captive assay of the shy-bold
   axis, can predict risk responsiveness during reproduction in wild great
   tits. Relatively slow-exploring (shy) females took longer than
   fast-exploring (bold) birds to resume incubation after a novel object,
   representing an unknown threat, was attached to their nest-box, with
   some shy individuals not returning within the 40 min trial period. Risk
   responsiveness was consistent within individuals over days. These
   findings provide rare, field-based experimental evidence that shy
   individuals prioritize survival over reproductive investment, supporting
   the hypothesis that personality reflects life-history variation through
   links with risk responsiveness.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Variation in behaviour occurs at multiple levels, including between
   individuals (personality) and between situations (plasticity). Behaviour
   also varies within individuals, and intra-individual variation (IIV) in
   behaviour describes within-individual residual variance in behaviour
   that remains after the effects of obvious external and internal
   influences on behaviour have been accounted for. IIV thus describes how
   predictable an individual's behaviour is. Differences in predictability,
   between individuals and between situations, might be biologically
   significant. For example, behaving unpredictably under predation threat
   might reduce the chance of capture. Here, we investigated the duration
   of startle responses in hermit crabs, in the presence and absence of a
   predator cue. Individuals differed in startle response duration
   (personality) and while individuals also varied in their sensitivity to
   risk, mean response time was greater in the presence of a predator
   (plasticity). Moreover, IIV was greater in the presence of a predator,
   providing some of the first evidence that the facultative injection of
   unpredictability into behaviour might represent a strategy for dealing

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dispersal is a major determinant of the ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics of natural populations. Individuals differ greatly in the
   likelihood and distance of dispersal, but it is generally unclear to
   what extent intrinsic, possibly genetic, differences contribute. Here we
   present the first explicit empirical evidence for genetic coupling of
   local dispersal and exploratory behaviour, a key `animal personality'
   trait. Using relatedness data from a multi-generation pedigree of
   free-living great tits (Parus major), we find quantitative genetic
   variation for both the distance of local dispersal within our study area
   and the rate at which individuals explore a novel environment. Moreover,
   we find a strongly positive genetic correlation between local dispersal
   distance and exploration rate, despite a weak and non-significant
   phenotypic correlation. These findings demonstrate a potentially
   important behavioural mechanism underlying heritable differences in
   local dispersal and highlight the potential for concerted evolution of
   dispersal and animal personality in response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour of animals, that is,
   personalities, are both widespread and widely studied, but very few
   studies also include cognitive traits in this context. Animal
   personality has recently been integrated into the pace-of-life-syndrome
   hypothesis, relating individual behavioural traits to life history.
   Variation in cognitive traits could be explained well by this
   theoretical framework. A risk-reward trade-off might lead to different
   cognitive types: Active birds that learn fast, take risks and probably
   have a fast lifestyle and less active, slow learning birds that are risk
   averse but thereby perform better in reversal learning as they probably
   pay more attention to external cues. We investigated the performance of
   zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in a cognitively challenging
   reversal learning task and linked this to two personality traits:
   activity and fearfulness. Male birds were better in reversal learning
   than females. While no personality-related differences occurred in the
   initial learning of our task, more active and fearful birds relearned
   the cue-reward association faster. While birds of different sex might
   have revealed different risk-taking strategies in the training, our
   findings do not reveal the expected direction of a risk-reward trade-off
   in the reversal learning. It seems likely that a more general and
   personality-related cognitive ability might improve performance across
   different tasks. The linkage between personality and cognition
   documented here could hence suggest that cognitive traits are indeed
   part of an overall pace-of-life syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour, aka personality, pose
   several evolutionary questions. For example, it is difficult to explain
   within-individual consistency in behaviour because behavioural
   plasticity is often advantageous. In addition, selection erodes
   heritable behavioural variation that is related to fitness, therefore we
   wish to know the mechanisms that can maintain between-individual
   variation in behaviour. In this paper, we argue that whole genome
   expression data can reveal new insights into the proximate mechanisms
   underlying personality, as well as its evolutionary consequences. After
   introducing the basics of whole genome expression analysis, we show how
   whole genome expression data can be used to understand whether
   behaviours in different contexts are affected by the same molecular
   mechanisms. We suggest strategies for using the power of genomics to
   understand what maintains behavioural variation, to study the evolution
   of behavioural correlations and to compare personality traits across
   diverse organisms.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{771-776}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviour is linked to fitness, but it is metabolically
   costly. Changes in metabolic demand during the reproductive cycle could
   constrain activity and thereby modulate behavioural phenotypes. We
   predicted that increased metabolic demands in late pregnancy would lead
   to reduced aggression and a lower metabolic cost of behaviour in the
   mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. Contrary to our prediction, females
   became more aggressive in late pregnancy, but metabolic scope (i.e. the
   metabolic energy available for activity and behaviour) decreased.
   Consequently, late-stage pregnant females spent significantly more of
   their available metabolic scope on aggressive behaviour. Hence, as
   pregnancy progressed, females showed increasingly risky behaviour by
   depleting metabolic resources available for activities other than
   fighting. We argue that the metabolic cost of behaviour, and possibly
   personality, is best expressed with reference to metabolic scope, rather
   than resting metabolic rates or concentrations of metabolites. This
   dependence on metabolic scope could render reproductive success
   sensitive to environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting species range expansions is an important
   challenge in modern ecology because of rapidly changing environments.
   Recent studies have revealed that consistent within-species variation in
   behavior (i.e., animal personality) can be imperative for dispersal
   success, a key process in range expansion. Here we investigate how
   habitat isolation can mediate differentiation of personality traits
   between recently founded island populations and the main population. We
   performed laboratory studies of boldness and exploration across life
   stages (tadpoles and froglets) using four isolated island populations
   and four mainland populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Both
   tadpoles and froglets from isolated populations were bolder and more
   exploratory than conspecifics from the mainland. Although the pattern
   can be influenced by possible differences in predation pressure, we
   suggest that this behavioral differentiation might be the result of a
   disperser-dependent founder effect brought on by an isolation-driven
   environmental filtering of animal personalities. These findings can have
   important implications for both species persistence in the face of
   climate change (i.e., range expansions) and ecological invasions as well
   as for explaining rapid speciation in isolated patches.}},

Abstract = {{Heritable personality variation is subject to fluctuating selection in
   many animal taxa; a major unresolved question is why this is the case. A
   parsimonious explanation must involve a general ecological process: a
   likely candidate is the omnipresent spatiotemporal variation in
   conspecific density. We tested whether spatiotemporal variation in
   density within and among nest box plots of great tits (Parus major)
   predicted variation in selection acting on exploratory behaviour (n=48
   episodes of selection). We found viability selection favouring faster
   explorers under lower densities but slower explorers under higher
   densities. Temporal variation in local density represented the primary
   factor explaining personality-related variation in viability selection.
   Importantly, birds did not anticipate changes in selection by means of
   adaptive density-dependent plasticity. This study thereby provides an
   unprecedented example of the key importance of the interplay between
   fluctuating selection and lack of adaptive behavioural plasticity in
   maintaining animal personality variation in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Significant between-individual variation in resting metabolic rate (RMR)
   of animals is a widespread phenomenon that may have important
   implications for our understanding of variation in behavior and animal
   personality. By using wild caught mealworm beetles, Tenebrio molitor, we
   examined the relationships among survival rate under predator tests,
   individual response latency time to become immobile under the risk of
   predation, duration of immobility time, and RMR. Individuals with higher
   levels of RMR were bold, and bold individuals were found to be more
   exposed to the risk of bird predation. We found that RMR was positively
   correlated with the latency of immobility response and negatively
   correlated with the total duration of immobility. The correlation
   between behavioral responses suggests a behavioral syndrome in the
   anti-predator behavior of T. molitor. The results indicate that energy
   metabolism may be part of a syndrome that involves behavior and life

Abstract = {{Birds can respond to an internal or external stimulus with activation of
   the HPA axis and secretion of corticosterone. There is considerable
   individual variation in corticosterone responses, and individual
   responses can be very different from the mean response for a group of
   birds. Corticosterone responses and behavioural responses to
   environmental stimuli are determined by individual characteristics
   called personality. It is proposed that birds with low corticosterone
   responses and proactive personalities are likely to be more successful
   (have greater fitness) in constant or predictable conditions, whilst
   birds with reactive personalities and high corticosterone responses will
   be more successful in changing or unpredictable conditions. The
   relationship between corticosterone responses and fitness thus depends
   on the prevailing environmental conditions, so birds with either low or
   high corticosterone responses can have the greatest fitness and be most
   successful, but in different situations. It is also proposed that birds
   with reactive personalities and high corticosterone responses will be
   better able to cope with environmental changes due to climate change
   than birds with proactive personalities and relatively low
   corticosterone responses. Phenotypic plasticity in corticosterone
   responses can be quantified using a reaction norm approach, and reaction
   norms can be used to determine the degree of plasticity in
   corticosterone responses of individual birds, and mean levels of
   plasticity in responses of species of birds. Individual corticosterone
   responses and personality, and reaction norms for corticosterone
   responses, can in future be used to predict the ability of birds to cope
   with environmental changes due to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour are present in most
   animal populations. Historically, the fitness consequences of
   behavioural types (e.g. bold and shy) have been investigated in one
   focal species at a time. Studies generally disregard variation in
   heterospecifics that interact with those types. However, intraspecific
   variation in behavioural types of multiple interactors could generate
   dependent effects of behavioural type x behavioural type in species
   interactions and might serve as a mechanism maintaining phenotypic
   variation in wild populations. Here we examined how behavioural types of
   both predators and prey jointly determine the outcome of a predatoreprey
   interaction using the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, and a
   syntopic field cricket, Gryllus integer. We assayed the antipredator
   (boldness) behaviour of individual G. integer and the boldness during
   foraging site selection of individual L. hesperus, as estimated by the
   spiders' tendency to settle in safe versus high-risk foraging
   environments. The best-fit models predicting prey survivorship and
   predator foraging success indicate that the behavioural tendencies of
   both predator and prey, as well as the interaction between them, jointly
   affect the outcome of staged predatoreprey interactions. These models
   boasted R-2 values 3-10 times those of models that considered
   behavioural type variation in either predator or prey alone. Our
   findings highlight the importance of considering the behavioural types
   of multiple interactors when testing the effects of behavioural types on
   species interactions and individual performance. More generally, our
   results strongly suggest that attention should be paid to multiple
   interactors if we are to understand the outcomes of species
   interactions. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animal personality is defined as behavior that is consistent across time
   and context. We here applied a reaction-norm perspective implemented as
   a random regression phenotypic model (RRPM) to behaviors measured on
   blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. During 3 consecutive breeding and winter
   seasons (2007-2009), a total of 508 wild-caught blue tits were assayed
   in a standard, artificial setup (a bird cage) for 1) activity, 2) time
   to escape, and 3) neophobia-related behavior. Activity was found to be
   repeatable both within and across seasonal contexts, but escape time and
   neophobia-related behavior were repeatable only in winter. Our RRPM
   confirmed that this latter finding was due to crossing of the
   individual-specific reaction norms between the 2 seasonal contexts. Our
   work illustrates how a behavior measured in a standardized manner may or
   may not be repeatable across time within a context but not between
   contexts, depending on the interindividual variation in reaction-norm
   properties. Our findings suggest that research on animal behavior
   plasticity can benefit from taking onboard context-specific analyses in
   a more explicit manner than what is typically done.}},

Abstract = {{Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) play an important role in
   structuring natural communities, and numerous studies have
   experimentally demonstrated their presence in a variety of systems.
   However, these studies have largely examined the presence or absence of
   traits that are responsible for these interactions, without considering
   natural variation between individuals in the extent to which these
   traits are manifested. We used a well-documented TMII to investigate the
   importance of individual behavior type for determining the strength of
   the TMII. The toadfish Opsanus tau has an indirect positive influence on
   bivalve survival because the mud crab Panopeus herbstii, a consumer of
   bivalves, reduces foraging effort in the presence of toadfish. We
   quantified variation in the strength of persistent individual mud crab
   responses to toadfish and resulting variation in the strength of TMII.
   We demonstrate that the strength of this TMII is strongly influenced by
   mud crab size and behavior type, strengthening with the intensity of
   response of individual mud crabs to toadfish predator cues. Further, we
   demonstrate that the spatial distribution within intertidal oyster reefs
   of crabs with different behavior types is not random; mud crabs
   inhabiting subtidal areas, where predator cues are more persistent, are
   significantly less responsive to toadfish cues than mud crabs from
   intertidal areas. This spatial behavioral structure should lead to
   spatial variation in the strength of TMII. Given the widespread
   importance of TMII and the broad occurrence of individual personality or
   behavior types across numerous taxa, these results should be generally
   applicable. The distribution of behavior types within a population may
   therefore be a useful metric for improving our ability to predict the
   strength of TMII.}},

Abstract = {{Significant inter-individual variation in the rate of animal metabolism
   is a widespread phenomenon that has started to accumulate general
   interest. Here we follow recent calls to focus on linkage between the
   variation in energy metabolism and animal personality. By using wild
   caught root voles as a study species, we examined the relationship
   between the behavioral patterns (assessed in open field test) and
   resting metabolic rate (RMR), both of which are known to show large
   individual differences and intra-individual consistency in voles. Our
   results showed only a weak relationship between personality traits and
   metabolism, since the most parsimonious model (according to AlCc)
   explaining RMR included only body mass and season as factors (explaining
   84.8\% of variation in RMR). However, the next two alternative models
   (within Delta AICc = 2) also included the personality trait reflecting
   proactive behaviors (PC1) in addition to body mass, sex and season (85.2
   and 85.8\% of RMR variance explained, respectively). In all, our study
   does not provide compelling support for recent ideas of close linkage
   between behavior and metabolism. Still, our study highlights that even
   in the case of wild caught individuals, when behavior and metabolism
   often carry effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic conditions, the
   potential metabolic effects of varying energetically costly behaviors
   cannot be neglected. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Features of an individual's early development are frequently reported to
   alter the postnatal ontogeny in litter-bearing mammals with respect to
   various physiological parameters. We hypothesized that such effects
   might also apply to the ontogeny of personality types. On the one hand,
   litter size effects by means of more contacts with littermates, might
   lead to the development of more offensive types. On the other hand,
   smaller and less developed young from larger litters might be less
   offensive due to their lower physical capabilities to deal with
   challenging situations. We studied these contrasting hypotheses in young
   rats, which we tested in a battery of emotionality tests. There were
   clear indications for the existence of distinct behavioral types by
   means of consistencies in behavioral responses within and across
   contexts. Based on these responses, we calculated three new variables by
   PCA, which we interpreted to mainly reflect boldness, exploration, and
   anxiety. Overall, our results strongly suggest that the early
   development alters the ontogeny of personality types, with heavier
   individuals being bolder and more explorative. Furthermore, body mass
   and litter size influenced the changes in the behavioral responses in
   successive tests, further supporting the importance of the litter
   size-dependent body mass for the ontogeny of personalities. Anxiety also
   depended on litter size, however, in a nonlinear way. Animals born to
   litters of small or large sizes had higher scores, whereas individuals
   from medium-sized litters were less anxious. This optimum curve
   indicates that opposing effects of litter size are involved in shaping
   personalities in young rats. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev

Abstract = {{Human exploitation of wild-living animals has been suggested to create a
   `landscape of fear'. A consequence could be that individuals surviving
   intensive harvesting, either as a result of behavioural plasticity
   and/or evolutionary change, exhibit increased average timidity. In the
   aquatic world, such effects are particularly well documented in
   passively operated fishing gears common to many commercial and
   recreational fisheries, such as angling, trapping or gill netting. We
   thus propose that an exploitation-induced timidity syndrome should be a
   widespread pattern in fisheries. Importantly, we argue that the syndrome
   can be associated with several ecological and managerial consequences
   for social groups, populations, food webs, fisheries and assessment of
   stocks. We suggest research priorities to deepen our understanding of
   how exploited fish populations behaviourally respond to harvesting.}},

Abstract = {{Most taxa show consistent individual differences in behavior, a
   phenomenon often referred to as animal personalities. While the links
   between individual personality and fitness have received considerable
   attention, little information is available on how animal personality
   impacts higher-order ecological processes, such as community dynamics.
   Using a mesocosm experiment, we subjected a representative community of
   alfalfa pests to different compositions of personality types of the wolf
   spider Pardosa milvina. We show that subtle variation in the personality
   composition of P. milvina populations generate wildly different prey
   communities, where a mixture of both active and sedentary individuals
   performs best at suppressing prey abundance. Our results provide the
   first experimental evidence that predator personality types can generate
   contrasting prey communities. Moreover, our results suggest that
   manipulating the representation of predator personality types may be a
   profitable avenue by which one can maximize the biocontrol potential of
   predator populations.}},

Title = {{Individual and sex-specific differences in intrinsic growth rate covary
   with consistent individual differences in behaviour}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1186-1195}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. The evolutionary causes of consistent individual differences in
   behaviour are currently a source of debate. A recent hypothesis suggests
   that consistent individual differences in life-history productivity
   (growth and/or fecundity) may covary with behavioural traits that
   contribute to growth-mortality trade-offs, such as risk-proneness
   (boldness) and foraging activity (voraciousness). It remains unclear,
   however, to what extent individual behavioural and life-history profiles
   are set early in life, or are a more flexible result of specific
   environmental or developmental contexts that allow bold and active
   individuals to acquire more resources.
   2. Longitudinal studies of individually housed animals under controlled
   conditions can shed light on this question. Since growth and behaviour
   can both vary within individuals (they are labile), studying
   between-individual correlations in behaviour and growth rate requires
   repeated scoring for both variables over an extended period of time.
   However, such a study has not yet been done.
   3. Here, we repeatedly measured individual mass seven times each,
   boldness 40 times each and voracity eight times each during the first 4
   months of life on 90 individually housed crayfish (Cherax destructor).
   Animals were fed ad libitum, generating a context where individuals can
   express their intrinsic growth rate (i. e. growth capacity), but in
   which bold and voracious behaviour is not necessary for high resource
   acquisition (crayfish can and do hoard food back to their burrow).
   4. We show that individuals that were consistently bold over time during
   the day were also bolder at night, were more voracious and maintained
   higher growth rates over time than shy individuals. Independent of
   individual differences, we also observed that males were fastergrowing,
   bolder and more voracious than females.
   5. Our findings imply that associations between bold behaviour and fast
   growth can occur in unlimited food contexts where there is no necessary
   link between bold behaviour and resource acquisition - offering support
   for the `personality-productivity' hypothesis. We suggest future
   research should study links between consistent individual differences in
   behaviour and life history under a wider range of contexts, in order to
   shed light on the role of biotic and abiotic conditions in the strength,
   direction and stability of their covariance.}},

Journal = {{ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Abstract = {{While invertebrates make up the majority of animal species, their
   welfare is overlooked compared to the concern shown to vertebrates. This
   fact is highlighted by the near absence of regulations in animal
   research, with the exception of cephalopods in the European Union. This
   is often justified by assumptions that invertebrates do not experience
   pain and stress while lacking the capacity for higher order cognitive
   functions. Recent research suggests that invertebrates may be just as
   capable as vertebrates in experiencing pain and stress, and some species
   display comparable cognitive capacities. Another obstacle is the
   negative view of invertebrates by the public, which often regards them
   as pests with no individual personalities, gastronomic entities, or
   individuals for scientific experimentation without rules. Increasingly,
   studies have revealed that invertebrates possess individual profiles
   comparable to the personalities found in vertebrates. Given the large
   economic impact of invertebrates, developing certain attitude changes in
   invertebrate welfare may be beneficial for producers while providing
   higher welfare conditions for the animals. While the immense number and
   type of species makes it difficult to suggest that all invertebrates
   will benefit from increased welfare, in this review we provide evidence
   that the topic of invertebrate welfare should be revisited, more
   thoroughly investigated, and in cases where appropriate, formally
   instituted.}},

Abstract = {{Animals of many species show consistency in behaviour across time and
   contexts that differs from other individuals' behaviour in the same
   population. Such `personality' affects fitness and has therefore become
   an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent
   variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living
   species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social
   interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This
   study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive
   chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen
   behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in
   at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable
   long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the
   short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed
   with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of
   which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability',
   `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour
   factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were
   analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor
   scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed
   also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait
   expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a
   broad range of social and non-social behaviours. The study highlights
   the importance of assessing personality in the social behaviour,
   especially in cohesive social species, as only then can we understand
   the consequences of personality in socially living species.}},

Abstract = {{Although recent models for the evolution of personality, using game
   theory and life-history theory, predict that individuals should differ
   consistently in their cooperative behaviour, consistent individual
   differences in cooperative behaviour have rarely been documented. In
   this study, we used a long-term data set on wild meerkats to quantify
   the repeatability of two types of cooperative care (babysitting and
   provisioning) within individuals and examined how repeatability varied
   across age, sex and status categories. Contributions to babysitting and
   provisioning were significantly repeatable and positively correlated
   within individuals, with provisioning more repeatable than babysitting.
   While repeatability of provisioning was relatively invariant across
   categories of individuals, repeatability of babysitting increased with
   age and was higher for subordinates than dominants. These results
   provide support for theoretical predictions that life-history trade-offs
   favour the evolution of consistent individual differences in cooperative
   behaviour and raise questions about why some individuals consistently
   help more than others across a suite of cooperative behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Do stable personnel agree on the personality characteristics of horses
   in their care? Working independently and under experimenter supervision,
   nine stable personnel rated the personality characteristics of each of
   10 individual horses using a questionnaire adapted from the NEO-PI-FFI
   of Costa and McCrae {[}Costa Jr., P. T. \& McCrae. R. R. (1992) Revised
   NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and NEO Five Factor Inventory

   Resources]. Raters achieved high inter-correlations in the ranking of
   the horses for all the Big Five dimensions, with the strongest agreement
   being achieved for Neuroticism and Extraversion. While previous research
   has demonstrated individual differences reminiscent of human personality
   characteristics, relatively few studies have explicitly used a human
   personality inventory for application to another species. It is also
   relatively rare for raters to be amateurs, rather than sophisticated
   research personnel and even human studies have rarely used more than two
   raters of the same individual. Our findings provide support for claims
   that personality is dependent upon biological factors with a long
   evolutionary history, such as brain anatomy and chemistry. The
   reliability of assessments by the participants and their ability to
   utilise personality descriptors with another species also raises
   interesting questions regarding the legitimacy of everyday use of

Abstract = {{Interest in animal personalities has generated a burgeoning literature
   on repeatability in individual traits such as boldness or exploration
   through time or across different contexts. Yet, repeatability can be
   influenced by the interactive social strategies of individuals, for
   example, consistent inter-individual variation in aggression is well
   documented. Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of
   repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic
   pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a
   heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is
   repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level
   remains unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of
   consistent and repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species
   of shark, a taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet
   to be described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten
   independent shark groups across different habitats, testing
   repeatability in individual network position under changing
   environments. To understand better the mechanisms behind repeatable
   social behaviour, we also explored the coupling between individual
   preferences for specific group sizes and social network position. We
   quantify repeatability in sharks by demonstrating that despite changes
   in aggregation measured at the group level, the social network position
   of individuals is consistent across treatments. Group size preferences
   were found to influence the social network position of individuals in
   small groups but less so for larger groups suggesting network structure,
   and thus, repeatability was driven by social preference over aggregation
   tendency.}},

Abstract = {{Despite that the existence of animal personalities is widely recognized,
   no consensus has been reached on the relative importance of different
   ecological factors behind their expression. Recently, it has been
   suggested that parasites may have a crucial role in shaping animal
   personalities, but only a very few studies have experimentally tested
   the idea. We infected Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) with the
   brain-encysted trematode parasite, Diplostomum phoxini, and studied
   whether infection could modify the personality of their hosts. Our
   results show that D. phoxini infection did not affect the mean levels of
   boldness, activity or exploration, but infected minnows showed higher
   repeatability in boldness and activity, and reduced repeatability in
   exploration. We also found that D. phoxini may be able to break the
   associations (behavioral syndromes) between behavioral traits, but that
   this effect may be dependent on parasite intensity. Furthermore, the
   effect of D. phoxini infection on personality of the hosts was found to
   be nonlinearly dependent on infection intensity. Taken together, our
   results suggest that D. phoxini parasites may shape the personality of
   their hosts, but that behavioral consequences of ecologically relevant
   infection levels may be rather subtle and easily remain undetected if
   only the mean trait expressions are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, composed of axes of consistent individual
   behaviors, are widely reported and can have important fitness
   consequences. However, despite theoretical predictions that life-history
   trade-offs may cause and maintain personality differences, our
   understanding of the evolutionary ecology of personality remains poor,
   especially in long-lived species where trade-offs and senescence have
   been shown to be stronger. Furthermore, although much theoretical and
   empirical work assumes selection shapes variation in personalities,
   studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of personality traits are
   rare. Here we study one standard axis of personality, the shy-bold
   continuum, in a long-lived marine species, the wandering albatross from
   Possession Island, Crozet, by measuring the behavioral response to a
   human approach. Using generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian
   framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable. We
   also find strong differences in boldness between breeding colonies,
   which vary in size and density, suggesting birds are shyer in more dense
   colonies. These results demonstrate that in this seabird population,
   boldness is both heritable and repeatable and highlights the potential
   for ecological and evolutionary processes to shape personality traits in
   species with varying life-history strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness is a personality trait that defines how individuals respond to
   risky situations and has clear fitness consequences. Since the adaptive
   value of boldness is context dependent, the benefit of a distinct
   personality is less clear when the environment is unpredictable. An
   ability to modulate behaviour can be beneficial, although as behavioural
   plasticity itself may be costly this depends on the levels of
   environmental stability. Both boldness and its plasticity are linked
   with physiological stress coping mechanisms, whereby animals with
   reduced glucocorticoid responses to stress are bolder and less flexible
   in behaviour. We investigated the behavioural changes made by bold and
   shy rainbow trout, and the magnitude of those changes, in response to
   predation risk and exposure to two environmental challenges. Behavioural
   and physiological responses under biotic (either no, predictable or
   unpredictable predation risk) and abiotic (temperature increase or
   hypoxia) factors were measured. Boldness was determined using a standard
   novel object paradigm. In general, after exposure to the treatments,
   fish exhibited less extreme bold or shy behaviour; the greatest change
   was observed in fish exposed to hypoxia, or those exposed to high risk
   particularly in shy fish held at a lower temperature. Higher risk also
   resulted in increased stress, suggesting that extreme bold or shy
   behaviour might have been maladaptive under a potential predator threat.
   These results represent novel evidence that boldness is flexible
   depending upon particular environmental challenges, with important
   implications for populations facing environmental extremes caused by
   anthropogenic activity and climate change. (C) 2013 The Association for

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest among behavioral ecologists in behavioral
   syndromes and animal personality. Studies of behavioral syndromes
   repeatedly measure the same individuals to quantify within-individual
   consistency and between-individual variation in behavior. Often these
   studies measure behavior in different contexts or in different
   behavioral assays to determine whether individual differences in
   behavior in one context are related to behavior in other contexts, that
   is, if there is a behavioral syndrome. For studies of behavioral
   syndromes, there is not universal agreement about whether it is
   preferable to randomize the order of different assays or to administer
   them in a fixed order. Here, I articulate the advantages and
   disadvantages of testing in a randomized or fixed order and offer some
   recommendations according to the goals and power of the experiment. In
   general, studies using within-subjects designs that are primarily
   interested in mean-level differences between treatments should randomize
   the order that individuals experience different treatments. Under
   certain conditions, studies of behavioral syndromes should also
   administer the assays in a randomized order, but only if the study is
   sufficiently powerful to statistically account for carryover and period
   effects. If the experimenter is interested in behavioral syndromes that
   are caused by carryovers, it is often preferable to test in a fixed
   order. If the experimenter wants to guard against carryovers, but the
   experiment is not sufficiently powerful to account for carryover and
   period effects, then a compromise is to test in a fixed order, but to
   test individuals in the context that is most likely to affect subsequent
   behavior last.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in how individuals cope behaviourally and physiologically with
   stressors is widespread and can have a significant impact on
   life-history traits and fitness. Individual coping styles are
   characterised by differential behavioural and adrenocortical reactivity
   to various challenges. As stress hormones can affect the production of
   reactive chemical species and the antioxidant status, individuals with
   different coping styles may differ also in oxidative status. Field
   studies on wild mammalian populations are few in number and none so far
   has simultaneously tested the relationship between coping style,
   adrenocortical reactivity and oxidative status in the same individuals.
   We measured individual variation in coping styles along a
   proactive-reactive continuum together with variation in baseline and
   stress-induced plasma oxidative damage, plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant
   capacity and cortisol in wild alpine marmots, Marmota marmota.
   Confirmatory path analysis revealed that different coping styles are
   accompanied by different baseline and stress-induced plasma oxidative
   statuses. Our findings also highlight the potential role of cortisol as
   a mediator of such differences.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during early development play a crucial role in
   shaping an organism's phenotype. To test how social group size affects
   stress response and behavioral characteristics, we used great tits
   (Parus major) from selection lines for exploratory behavior, a proxy for
   an avian personality trait, and birds from the wild in a brood size
   manipulation experiment. Nestlings were tested for stress response using
   an established stress test and after independence subjects were tested
   for exploratory behavior. Nestlings from small broods showed a stronger
   stress response than nestlings from normal-sized broods. Exploratory
   behavior was not affected by brood size but associated with sex ratio in
   the nest. Birds from female-biased broods became faster explorers than
   those from male-biased broods. The results demonstrate that early social
   conditions can affect physiological stress responses in nestlings and
   that behavioral personality traits measured after fledging can be
   affected by the social experience in the nest. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{In animal communication, sexually selected signals have been shown to
   often signal individual attributes such as motivation or quality.
   Birdsong is among the best studied signalling systems, and song traits
   vary substantially among individuals. The question remains if variation
   in signalling also reflects more general and consistent individual
   characteristics. Such consistent individual differences in behaviour
   that are relatively stable over time and contexts are referred to as
   personality or behavioural syndromes. Here, we studied the relation
   between singing and explorative behaviour, a well-studied personality
   trait, using great tits (Parus major) under standardized aviary
   conditions. The results show that singing activity measured as the
   number of songs sung in spring prior to breeding correlated with male
   but not with female explorative behaviour. In contrast, song repertoire
   was not related to explorative behaviour but varied over the day. The
   link between explorative and singing behaviour suggests that sexually
   selected signals are more than signals of quality but can also reflect
   other intrinsic behavioural characteristics such as personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Mice selected for aggression and coping (long attack latency (LAL),
   reactive coping strategy; short attack latency (SAL), pro-active coping
   strategy) are a useful model for studying the physiological background
   of animal personalities. These mice also show a differential stress
   responsiveness, especially in terms of hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal
   axis reactivity, to various challenges. Since the stress response can
   increase the production of reactive oxygen species, we predicted that
   the basic oxidative status of the lines could differ. We found that LAL
   showed higher serum antioxidant capacity (OXY) than SAL, while no
   differences emerged for reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) or the
   balance between ROMs and OXY, reflecting oxidative stress. Moreover, the
   lines showed inverse relationships between ROMs or OXY and body mass
   corrected for age. The results indicate that variation in oxidative
   status is heritable and linked to personality. This suggests that
   different animal personalities may be accompanied by differences in
   oxidative status, which may predict differences in longevity.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersal and migration of organisms have resulted in the
   colonisation of nearly every possible habitat and ultimately the
   extraordinary diversity of life. Animal dispersal tendencies are
   commonly heterogeneous (e.g. long vs. short) and non-random suggesting
   that phenotypic and genotypic variability between individuals can
   contribute to population-level heterogeneity in dispersal. Using
   laboratory and field experiments, we demonstrate that natural allelic
   variation in a gene underlying a foraging polymorphism in larval fruit
   flies (for), also influences their dispersal tendencies as adults. Rover
   flies (for(R); higher foraging activity) have consistently greater
   dispersal tendencies and are more likely to disperse longer distances
   than sitter flies (for(s); lower foraging activity). Increasing for
   expression in the brain and nervous system increases dispersal in sitter
   flies. Our study supports the notion that variation in dispersal can be
   driven by intrinsic variation in food-dependent search behaviours and
   confirms that single gene pleiotropic effects can contribute to
   population-level heterogeneity in dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, integration of personality traits into a `pace-of-life
   syndrome' (POLS) context has been advocated. To be able to understand
   how an individual's behavioural, physiological and life history traits
   may coevolve, we need to jointly quantify these traits in order to study
   their covariance. Few studies have established links between personality
   and immunity properties of an individual. We here examined covariation
   of a measure of skeletal size (tarsus length), three behavioural traits
   (activity, handling aggression and breath rate) and two immunological
   traits (IgG level and haematocrit), in 592 wild caught blue tits. Many
   individuals (201) were tested more than once, allowing quantification of
   individual consistency of all traits and partition of the covariances
   between the traits, using a multivariate mixed model, into between
   individual and residual covariances. We find individual consistency of
   all behavioural traits, indicating that these capture aspects of blue
   tit adult personality and also the physiological measures are
   repeatable. Contrary to the POLS expectation, we find no overall
   significant individual level correlation structure between these traits
   and a factor analytical approach confirmed that between individual
   correlations across traits were not due to a common (POLS) factor or
   driven by size (tarsus length). Based on a published power study, we
   conclude that there is no common syndrome of individual level covariance
   between personality and physiological traits in wild blue tits or that
   the effect sizes, such a syndrome generates, are too low (r < 0.3) to
   detect. Future field-based work should be designed to explore low effect
   sizes and strive to measure specific traits whose involvement is
   implicated to have large effect sizes as based on, e.g. laboratory
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of `state' has been suggested as an underlying factor
   explaining behavioural stability and animal personality (i.e. variation
   among, and consistency within individuals in behavioural responses), but
   the possibility that stable social relationships represent such states
   remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the influence of social status
   on the expression and consistency of behaviours by experimentally
   changing social status between repeated personality assays. We used male
   domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a social species that forms
   relatively stable dominance hierarchies, and showed that behavioural
   responses were strongly affected by social status, but also by
   individual characteristics. The level of vigilance, activity and
   exploration changed with social status, whereas boldness appeared as a
   stable individual property, independent of status. Furthermore,
   variation in vocalization predicted future social status, indicating
   that individual behaviours can both be a predictor and a consequence of
   social status, depending on the aspect in focus. Our results illustrate
   that social states contribute to both variation and stability in
   behavioural responses, and should therefore be taken into account when
   investigating and interpreting variation in personality.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits that co-vary across contexts or situations often
   reflect fundamental trade-offs which individuals experience in different
   contexts (e. g. fitness trade-offs between exploration and predation
   risk). Since males tend to experience greater variance in reproductive
   success than females, there may be considerable fitness benefits
   associated with ``bolder{''} behavioural types, but only recently have
   researchers begun to consider sex-specific and life-history strategies
   associated with these. Here we test the hypothesis that male
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) show high risk but
   potentially high return behaviours compared to females. According to
   this hypothesis we predicted that male fish would show greater
   exploration of their environment in a foraging context, and be caught
   sooner by an experimenter than females. We found that the time fish
   spent out of cover exploring their environment was correlated over two
   days, and males spent significantly more time out of cover than females.
   Also, the order in which fish were net-caught from their holding
   aquarium by an experimenter prior to experiments was negatively
   correlated with the time spent out of cover during tests, and males
   tended to be caught sooner than females. Moreover, we found a positive
   correlation between the catch number prior to our experiments and nine
   months after, pointing towards consistent, long-term individual
   differences in behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is much interest in behavioral syndromes, very little is
   known about how syndromes are generated in wild populations. Here, we
   assess the roles of correlated selection and divergent rearing
   environments in generating a syndrome between foraging aggressiveness
   and boldness in the spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica. We first tested
   for and confirmed the presence of a behavioral syndrome between boldness
   and foraging aggressiveness in wild penultimate A.pennsylvanica
   (r=0.24). Then, to assess the effects of rearing environment on the
   boldnessaggressiveness syndrome, we compared the behavioral tendencies
   of field- vs. laboratory-reared spiders over the course of their
   development. The presence of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome
   differed based on spiders' developmental stage and rearing environment:
   field-reared juveniles did not exhibit a syndrome between boldness and
   foraging aggressiveness, but field-reared penultimates did. In contrast,
   laboratory-reared spiders never exhibited a behavioral syndrome,
   regardless of their developmental stage. Thus, the
   boldnessaggressiveness syndrome in A.pennsylvanica manifests only when
   individuals are reared in the field. Selection data from a markrecapture
   study failed to indicate any signature of correlated selection, despite
   our finding that at least one element of the syndrome (foraging
   aggressiveness) can respond to selection (Heritability h2=0.27, from
   mid-parent breeding study). Thus, contemporary correlated selection does
   not appear to be a major driver of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome
   of A.pennsylvanica. Taken together, our data are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome exhibited by wild
   A.pennsylvanica develops as a result of environmentally induced
   phenotypic plasticity, and not correlated selection.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Individual-based studies allow quantification of phenotypic plasticity
   in behavioural, life-history and other labile traits. The study of
   phenotypic plasticity in the wild can shed new light on the ultimate
   objectives (1) whether plasticity itself can evolve or is constrained by
   its genetic architecture, and (2) whether plasticity is associated to
   other traits, including fitness (selection). I describe the main
   statistical approach for how repeated records of individuals and a
   description of the environment (E) allow quantification of variation in
   plasticity across individuals (IxE) and genotypes (GxE) in wild
   populations. Based on a literature review of life-history and
   behavioural studies on plasticity in the wild, I discuss the present
   state of the two objectives listed above. Few studies have quantified
   GxE of labile traits in wild populations, and it is likely that power to
   detect statistically significant GxE is lacking. Apart from the issue of
   whether it is heritable, plasticity tends to correlate with average
   trait expression (not fully supported by the few genetic estimates
   available) and may thus be evolutionary constrained in this way.
   Individual-specific estimates of plasticity tend to be related to other
   traits of the individual (including fitness), but these analyses may be
   anti-conservative because they predominantly concern stats-on-stats.
   Despite the increased interest in plasticity in wild populations, the
   putative lack of power to detect GxE in such populations hinders
   achieving general insights. I discuss possible steps to invigorate the
   field by moving away from simply testing for presence of GxE to analyses
   that `scale up' to population level processes and by the development of
   new behavioural theory to identify quantitative genetic parameters which
   can be estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits are often plastic and can allow animals important
   flexibility when environmental conditions vary. However, studies of
   animal personality suggest that behaviour can be `constrained' to
   certain behavioural types, leading to consistent differences between
   individuals. Few studies have investigated the interaction between
   personality traits and the need for flexibility in individuals over
   different, naturally occurring situations in the wild. We investigated
   whether free-living Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, were
   constrained by personality types or showed behavioural plasticity when
   their environmental conditions changed dramatically between the dry and
   rainy seasons. We examined three key behaviours: risk taking as measured
   by flight initiation distance, time budgets focusing on time spent
   conspicuous and rates of signalling directed at conspecifics.
   Risk-taking behaviour of males showed stable between-individual
   differences, but no between-individual differences in plasticity,
   supporting previous evidence that antipredator behaviour is determined
   by personality in this species. Time spent conspicuous showed a response
   to season, and an interaction between the individual and season,
   suggesting that behavioural plasticity itself may be a personality
   trait. In contrast, signalling behaviour changed in response to season
   but did not vary consistently between individuals. We suggest that where
   there are reliable environmental cues, individual plasticity will be
   favoured over consistency in the relevant behaviours. (C) 2012 The

   the Beadlet Anemone Actinia equina (Cnidaria)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{`Animal personality' means that individuals differ from one another in
   either single behaviours or suites of related behaviours in a way that
   is consistent over time. It is usually assumed that such consistent
   individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how
   individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than
   by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat.
   Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect
   `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals
   with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle
   responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether
   personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a
   simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among
   individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three
   week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool
   temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in
   microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a
   range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could
   have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of
   individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A.
   equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may
   be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in
   species with simple nervous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Food webs are networks of species that feed on each other. The role that
   within-population phenotypic and genetic variation plays in food web
   structure is largely unknown. Here, I show via simulation how variation
   in two key traits, growth rates and phenology, by influencing the
   variability of body sizes present through time, can potentially affect
   several structural parameters in the direction of enhancing food web
   persistence: increased connectance, decreased interaction strengths,
   increased variation among interaction strengths and increased degree of
   omnivory. I discuss other relevant traits whose variation could affect
   the structure of food webs, such as morphological and additional
   life-history traits, as well as animal personalities. Furthermore, trait
   variation could also contribute to the stability of food web modules
   through metacommunity dynamics. I propose future research to help
   establish a link between within-population variation and food web
   structure. If appropriately established, such a link could have
   important consequences for biological conservation, as it would imply
   that preserving (functional) genetic variation within populations could
   ensure the preservation of entire communities.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of animal personalities has recently become of major
   interest as researchers began to wonder why animals within a given
   population show consistent behaviour across situations and contexts,
   what led to the evolution of such behavioural inflexibility and what
   mechanisms might underlie the phenomenon. A recent model explains
   individual differences in a population as the result of trade-off
   between present and future reproduction. We tested this model on the two
   wing morphs, i.e. short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged
   (macropterous) specimens of the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus). Since it
   has been already demonstrated that the two wing morphs differ in their
   life-history strategies, this species is an ideal subject to test
   whether the specimens with different life-history strategies have
   different personalities as well. The results show that individuals
   behave consistently over time and across contexts, meaning observed bugs
   do have personalities. We also have found that in females, the two wing
   morphs have different personalities supporting the theoretical
   predictions, i.e. winged ones, which are supposed to have lower future
   reproductive value, are braver and more exploratory. We found no
   difference between the morphs in males. Differences in reproductive
   investment might explain this discrepancy between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are
   inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease
   ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective
   fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the
   behaviour disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects
   parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between
   the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites
   are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on
   parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is
   essential for understanding the complex connections between animal
   behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point,
   we discuss how host behaviour parasite feedbacks might operate and
   explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and
   parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure
   on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about
   parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites
   and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the
   maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the
   feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather
   than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between
   mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour
   parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding
   of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality can be seen as behavioral polymorphism that could
   play a direct and active role in driving evolutionary pathways. We argue
   here that consistent individual differences in key personality traits
   affecting dispersal and other density-dependent processes have provided
   substantial contributions to molding biogeographic patterns. Building
   upon opportunities recently opened by genomics and other novel
   approaches, we explore the hypothesis that Pleistocene range expansions,
   island colonizations, and other historical biogeographic processes could
   have been promoted by non-random samples of behavioral types of the
   founder populations. We provide context and testable hypotheses, based
   on case studies, that could bring new implications to our understanding
   of the processes shaping spatial and temporal patterns of variation in

Abstract = {{Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by
   virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable
   interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how
   the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level
   phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual
   differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals'
   participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group
   composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition,
   group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We
   performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory
   conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and
   (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the
   laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task
   participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size:
   larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to
   participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies
   composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of
   attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our
   field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which
   colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size,
   morphological composition and personality composition; none of these
   effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found
   that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more
   spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that
   colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by
   spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics. The

Abstract = {{Social animals must time and coordinate their behaviour to ensure the
   benefits of grouping, resulting in collective movements and the
   potential emergence of leaders and followers. However, individuals often
   differ consistently from one another in how they cope with their
   environment, a phenomenon known as animal personality, which may affect
   how individuals use coordination rules and requiring them to compromise.
   Here we tracked the movements of pairs of three-spined sticklebacks,
   Gasterosteus aculeatus, separated by a transparent partition that
   allowed them to observe and interact with one another in a context
   containing cover. Individuals differed consistently in their tendency to
   approach their partner's compartment during collective movements. The
   strength of this social attraction was positively correlated with the
   behavioural coordination between members of a pair but was negatively
   correlated with an individual's tendency to lead. Social attraction may
   form part of a broader behavioural syndrome as it was predicted by the
   boldness of an individual, measured in isolation prior to the
   observation of pairs, and by the boldness of the partner. We found that
   bolder fish, and those paired with bolder partners, tended to approach
   their partner's compartment less closely. These findings provide
   important insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and
   functioning of social groups and the emergence and maintenance of
   consistent behavioural differences. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{The social niche specialization hypothesis predicts that repeated social
   interactions will generate social niches within groups, thereby
   promoting consistent individual differences in behaviour. Current
   support for this hypothesis is mixed, probably because the importance of
   social niches is dependent upon the ecology of the species. We test
   whether repeated interactions among group mates generate consistent
   individual differences in boldness in the social spider, Stegodyphus
   dumicola. In support of the social niche specialization hypothesis, we
   found that consistent individual differences in boldness increased with
   longer group tenure. Interestingly, these differences took longer to
   appear than in previous work suggesting this species needs more
   persistent social interactions to shape its behaviour. Recently
   disturbed colonies were shyer than older colonies, possibly reflecting
   differences in predation risk. Our study emphasizes the importance of
   the social environment in generating animal personalities, but also
   suggests that the pattern of personality development can depend on
   subtle differences in species' ecologies.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Exercise, which may be defined as bodily movement produced by the
   contraction of skeletal muscle and which increases energy expenditure
   above basal levels, is essential for fitness-related activities such as
   foraging, migration and dispersal. The frequency with which individuals
   engage in exercise depends on a range of intrinsic and environmental
   factors. Exercise itself can modify behaviour by inducing endocrine
   changes and by a training effect that increases physiological
   capacities.
   Here, we test the hypothesis that exercise changes behaviour and that
   there is positive feedback so that performing exercise increases the
   likelihood of performing exercise-related behaviours.
   We show that there was a training effect that improved sustained
   swimming performance of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) exposed to
   chronic exercise in flowing water for 4weeks compared to sedentary
   controls. Exercised fish also became bolder and were quicker to leave a
   refuge, showed an increasing tendency to explore unfamiliar
   environments, and were more aggressive than sedentary fish. These
   physiological and behavioural changes reverted back to control levels
   when exercised fish assumed a sedentary lifestyle again.
   We used the calcium channel blocker nifedipine to decrease swimming
   performance of exercised fish to control levels, which allowed us to
   determine whether increased locomotor capacity per se influences
   behaviour. We show that reducing the swimming performance of exercised
   fish also reduced exploration and aggression, but it did not affect the
   latency to leave a refuge (boldness).
   Our data show that behavioural phenotypes are not fixed. Exercise
   changes behaviour and may thereby alter interactions between individuals
   and dispersal. Environmental changes that demand increased levels of
   exercise induce behavioural responses that are likely to increase the
   success of individuals under these changed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite an expanding interest in animal personalities, the influence of
   social interactions and sex differences on individual differences in
   behaviour remains poorly understood. Using the social zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata), we tested for behavioural differences in
   exploration of a novel environment and objects, between individuals of
   both sexes in relation to a social context; the presence of three male
   companions, three female companions or no companion birds. We predicted
   that the presence of conspecific companions should result in focal birds
   reacting to novelty by exploring more extensively because the companion
   birds contribute to anti-predator vigilance behaviour and because social
   isolation often causes behavioural inhibition in social species. We
   found that exploratory behaviour of focal individuals was significantly
   reduced in the presence of conspecific companions, irrespective of the
   companion's sex. Moreover, we found a weak trend towards females being
   more exploratory than males, irrespective of the social context. These
   results demonstrate the importance of considering the social context in
   animal personality studies and of exploring sex differences in
   personalities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in learning abilities within populations suggests that complex
   learning may not necessarily be more adaptive than simple learning Yet
   the high cost of complex learning cannot fully explain this variation
   without some understanding of why complex learning is too costly for
   some individuals but not for others Here we propose that different
   social foraging strategies can favor different learning strategies (that
   learn the environment with high or low resolution) thereby maintaining
   variable learning abilities within populations Using a genetic algorithm
   in an agent-based evolutionary simulation of a social foraging game (the
   producer-scrounger game) we demonstrate how an association evolves
   between a strategy based on Independent search for food (playing a
   producer) and a complex (high resolution) learning rule while a strategy
   that combines Independent search and following others (playing a
   scrounger) evolves an association with a simple (low resolution)
   learning rule The reason for these associations is that for complex
   learning to have an advantage a large number of learning steps normally
   not achieved by scroungers are necessary These results offer a general
   explanation for persistent variation in cognitive abilities that is
   based on co-evolution of learning rules and social foraging strategies

Abstract = {{Individual variation in exploration behavior can affect fitness, can be
   individually consistent and heritable, and is increasingly measured as
   an animal personality trait in novel environment tests. Exploration
   speed in novel environment tests is generally found to be positively
   correlated with movement distances in wild animals, but such studies
   tend to be limited to single measures of exploration and rarely
   investigate the role of other correlates of movement behavior in the
   wild. We show that scores of the speed of exploration of wild juvenile
   starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in novel environment tests are not
   correlated with either the maximum extent of, or the size of the most
   frequently used part of, their home range. By contrast, scores that
   reflect what parts of the novel environment were explored are correlated
   with the size of the most frequently used area and tend to be correlated
   with the maximum home range size. The latter relationship was stronger
   for individuals that were on average found in larger flocks and for
   individuals with less suitable foraging habitat in their range. We
   conclude that aspects of exploration other than its speed may be better
   predictors of exploration in the wild for some species. Moreover, our
   findings further illustrate that the association between animal
   personality traits such as exploration behavior and the behavioral
   ecology of wild animals may depend on the environmental or social
   context. These findings are discussed in the context of individual
   variation in the response to environmental variability.}},

   ontogenetic boundary}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{173-185}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural traits can strongly influence fitness and survival and are
   important mediators of life history trade-offs. This study explored the
   links between mortality trade-offs associated with fast growth during
   larval life and behaviour of individuals during an important life
   history transition. Longitudinal sampling of a cohort of damselfish
   settling on a reef at the end of their larval stage found that
   individuals with small otolith sizes at hatching and low otolith growth
   rates were selectively removed from the local population, while there
   was no apparent selection for size or body condition over the first 24 h
   after settlement. Selection against slow growth (initial larval growth
   and maximum growth) and small size at hatching and settlement were
   accentuated over the first month after settlement. Detailed behavioural
   assessments of naive larvae settled onto habitat patches and monitored
   for 24 h found that initial boldness aided survival, but individuals
   that ventured larger distances from shelter suffered higher mortality.
   Correlations of growth with behavioural attributes were generally poor;
   however, there was a weak correlation between boldness and maximum
   growth. A measure of flexibility in the maximum distance ventured from
   shelter was positively related to initial otolith growth. Our results
   suggest that although early growth which is relatively slow leads to
   higher mortality later in life, and behavioural attributes influenced
   survival, there were only weak correlations between growth history and
   behaviour. This may be due to strong selective pressures on young fish
   to learn novel behaviours rapidly after settlement. Selection may
   promote behavioural flexibility at this key ecological transition.}},

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', defined as repeatable inter-individual differences
   in behaviour, is a concept in biology that faces intense controversy.
   Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and
   methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework.
   Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying
   individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences
   in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this
   trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of
   estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the
   inter-and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing
   parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we
   outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to
   describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second,
   we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help
   researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory
   power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological
   traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and
   present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while
   measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its
   own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural
   selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in
   complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural
   traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural
   differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology,
   endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g.
   selection gradients, heritability).}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{931-940}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Predation plays a fundamental role in evolutionary processes, driving
   changes in prey morphology, physiology and behaviour. With organisms
   being increasingly exposed to rapid environmental changes, there is
   growing interest in understanding individual phenotypic plasticity in
   response to changes in predation pressure. Behavioural and physiological
   responses to predator exposure are of particular interest as differences
   in predation pressure are often reflected in correlated suites of
   behavioural and hormonal profiles across populations. Within
   populations, the association between endocrine profiles and behaviour is
   less understood and often lacking. Adopting a reaction norm approach and
   a repeated measures design, we assessed within-population effects of
   changes in perceived predation risk on endocrinology and behaviour in
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We repeatedly
   exposed subjects to a robotic model predator and assessed their
   behavioural response. The fish showed consistent behavioural profiles
   and were less active and shyer when predation risk was higher. Using
   non-invasive waterborne hormone analysis, we assessed basal cortisol as
   well as the cortisol response to changes in predation risk. Individuals
   showed significantly higher cortisol levels following exposure to the
   model predator. Individual post-predator exposure cortisol was
   repeatable but unrelated to behavioural responses. Accounting for
   between versus within-subject effects, we found that basal cortisol and
   shyness were positively related within individuals, that is individuals
   overall were shyer on days they had higher cortisol levels. We also
   tested if basal testosterone predicted risky behaviour and found no
   evidence for this hypothesis. No individual differences in hormonal or
   behavioural responses to changes in predation risk were found,
   suggesting that individuals are not constrained by their personalities
   in their ability to cope with a potentially harmful threat. Overall, we
   show that individuals of different personalities are equally flexible'
   in their response to changes in predation pressure. Our study offers
   novel insight into consistent individual differences and plasticity in
   hormones and behaviour as well as their interplay within populations.
   Future studies should assess the applicability of these findings to
   other changes in the environment, as well as the effects of social
   context on endocrine and behavioural reaction norms.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We examined the relative importance of individual differences in
   personality (activity and aggressiveness), social skill and the social
   environment (average activity and aggressiveness of the group, presence
   of hyperaggressive males) in determining the behaviour and mating
   success of males of the stream water strider, Aquarius remigis. Males
   that had a consistently more active-aggressive behavioural type had, on
   average, higher mating success largely because they spent more time
   active in microhabitats associated with acquiring mates. Some
   active-aggressive males, however, showed hyperaggressive behaviour,
   apparently attempting to mate forcibly with other males, or forcibly
   separate pairs, which was rarely successful. A higher tendency to be
   hyperaggressive was associated with reduced mating success (i.e. being
   hyperaggressive represents low social skill). The overall effect was
   thus stabilizing sexual selection on male activity and aggression. The
   social environment also had large effects on male behaviour and mating
   success. In particular, the presence of a keystone hyperaggressive male
   had strong negative effects on the mating success and general activity
   of other males in the pool. Notably, males with a more active-aggressive
   behavioural type maintained higher mating success than less
   active-aggressive males in the presence of a hyperaggressive male.
   Social plasticity (change in behaviour in response to changing social
   conditions) also depended on the male's behavioural type; males with a
   more active-aggressive behavioural type were more plastic. (C) 2014 The

   Division of Labor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Division of labor is a defining characteristic of social insects and
   fundamental to their ecological success. Many of the numerous tasks
   essential for the survival of the colony must be performed at a specific
   location. Consequently, spatial organization is an integral aspect of
   division of labor. The mechanisms organizing the spatial distribution of
   workers, separating inside and outside workers without central control,
   is an essential, but so far neglected aspect of division of labor. In
   this study, we investigate the behavioral mechanisms governing the
   spatial distribution of individual workers and its physiological
   underpinning in the ant Myrmica rubra. By investigating worker
   personalities we uncover position-associated behavioral syndromes. This
   context-independent and temporally stable set of correlated behaviors
   (positive association between movements and attraction towards light)
   could promote the basic separation between inside (brood tenders) and
   outside workers (foragers). These position-associated behavior syndromes
   are coupled with a high probability to perform tasks, located at the
   defined position, and a characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon profile. We
   discuss the potentially physiological causes for the observed behavioral
   syndromes and highlight how the study of animal personalities can
   provide new insights for the study of division of labor and
   self-organized processes in general.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic interactions in aquatic communities are dominated by predation,
   and the distribution of trophic link strengths in aquatic food webs
   crucially impacts their dynamics and stability. Although individual body
   size explains a large proportion of variation in trophic link strengths
   in aquatic habitats, current predominately body size-based views can
   gain additional realism by incorporating further traits. Functional
   traits that potentially affect the strength of trophic links can be
   classified into three groups: i) body size, ii) traits that identify the
   spatiotemporal overlap between the predators and their prey, and iii)
   predator foraging and prey vulnerability traits, which are readily
   available for many taxa. Relationship between these trait groups and
   trophic link strength may be further modified by population densities,
   habitat complexity, temperature and other abiotic factors. I propose
   here that this broader multi-trait framework can utilize concepts, ideas
   and existing data from research on metabolic ecology, ecomorphology,
   animal personalities and role of habitats in community structuring. The
   framework can be used to investigate non-additive effects of traits on
   trophic interactions, shed more light on the structuring of local food
   webs and evaluate the merits of taxonomic and functional group
   approaches in the description of predator-prey interactions. Development
   of trait-and size-based descriptions of food webs could be particularly
   fruitful in limnology given the relative paucity of well resolved
   datasets in standing waters.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour has been termed `animal
   personality' and has been identified across a range of behavioural
   contexts including aggression, boldness in response to a threatening
   stimulus and exploration. When behaviours are correlated across multiple
   functional behavioural categories or `contexts', `behavioural syndromes'
   are said to be present. It is possible, however, that behavioural
   syndromes may also show consistencies. Here we investigated the presence
   of behavioural syndromes linking startle responses, exploration and
   aggression in hermit crabs and assessed their stability across two
   situations (low versus high predation risk). Correlation analyses
   detected behavioural syndromes between startle responses, a measure of
   `boldness', and the latency to investigate a novel object, as well as
   the latency to attack an opponent in an aggressive context. The startle
   response-investigation and startle response-aggression syndromes were
   stable between situations, whilst there was a lack of relationship
   between investigation and aggression in each situation. Here we propose
   that these consistent individual differences in the expression of
   behavioural syndromes reveal the presence of animal personality,
   manifesting in not just one, but a suite of interacting traits.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency or predictability through time and/or different
   contexts ('syndromes' or `personality types') is likely to have
   substantial influence on animal life histories and fitness.
   Consequently, there is much interest in the forces driving and
   maintaining various syndromes. Individual host behaviours have been
   associated with susceptibility to parasitism, yet the role of
   pre-existing personality types in acquiring infections has not been
   investigated experimentally. Using a larval amphibian-trematode parasite
   model system, we report that tadpoles generally showed consistency in
   their activity level in response to both novel food and parasite
   exposure. Not only were individual activity level and exploration in the
   novel food context correlated with each other and with anti-parasite
   behaviour, all three were significant predictors of host parasite load.
   This is the first empirical demonstration that host behaviours in other
   contexts are related to behaviours mitigating infection risk and,
   ultimately, host parasite load. We suggest that this system illustrates
   how reliably high levels of activity and exploratory behaviour in
   different contexts might maximize both energy acquisition and resistance
   to trematode parasites. Such benefits could drive selection for the
   behavioural syndrome seen here owing to the life histories and
   ecological circumstances typical of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus)
   larvae.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, considerable research interest in behavioral ecology
   has focused on characterizing and understanding individual differences
   in behavior that are consistent over time and across contexts, termed
   animal ``personalities,{''} and correlations between various behaviors
   across contexts, termed behavioral syndromes. Although there is some
   evidence that differences in personality among individuals within
   populations can be genetically based and adaptive, when and how
   individual personality differences emerge in a population is not well
   understood, but of considerable general interest. Here, using juveniles
   of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) as a model system, we
   investigated in the laboratory whether individuals consistently differ
   in their personalities and whether behavioral syndromes are apparent at
   an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality
   traits are heritable. Under standardized laboratory conditions and using
   sibling analysis, we quantified interindividual differences in their
   boldness behavior under potential predation threat and their exploratory
   activity in a novel environment, 2 ecologically important behaviors, as
   our focal personality traits and estimated their respective
   repeatability and heritability. We report for the first time consistent
   (repeatable) and heritable individual differences in boldness and
   exploratory behaviors, and a boldness-exploration behavioral syndrome,
   in young convict cichlids. Bolder fish were more exploratory than
   relatively timid ones. These results provide novel evidence for the
   emergence in early life history of consistent individual differences in
   personality traits and behavioral syndromes in this species and suggest
   that genetic variation for boldness and exploratory behaviors, and thus
   potential for selection on these traits, exists in our study population.}},

Abstract = {{A central simplifying assumption in evolutionary behavioral ecology has
   been that optimal behavior is unaffected by genetic or proximate
   constraints. Observations and experiments show otherwise, so that
   attention to decision architecture and mechanisms is needed. In
   psychology, the proximate constraints on decision making and the
   processes from perception to behavior are collectively described as the
   emotion system. We specify a model of the emotion system in fish that
   includes sensory input, neuronal computation, developmental modulation,
   and a global organismic state and restricts attention during decision
   making for behavioral outcomes. The model further includes food
   competition, safety in numbers, and a fluctuating environment. We find
   that emergent strategies in evolved populations include common emotional
   appraisal of sensory input related to fear and hunger and also include
   frequency-dependent rules for behavioral responses. Focused attention is
   at times more important than spatial behavior for growth and survival.
   Spatial segregation of the population is driven by personality
   differences. By coupling proximate and immediate influences on behavior
   with ultimate fitness consequences through the emotion system, this
   approach contributes to a unified perspective on the phenotype, by
   integrating effects of the environment, genetics, development,
   physiology, behavior, life history, and evolution.}},

Title = {{How does variation in the environment and individual cognition explain

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{According to recent studies on animal personalities, the level of
   behavioral plasticity, which can be viewed as the slope of the
   behavioral reaction norm, varies among individuals, populations, and
   species. Still, it is conceptually unclear how the interaction between
   environmental variation and variation in animal cognition affect the
   evolution of behavioral plasticity and expression of animal
   personalities. Here, we (1) use literature to review how environmental
   variation and individual variation in cognition explain population and
   individual level expression of behavioral plasticity and (2) draw
   together empirically yet nontested, conceptual framework to clarify how
   these factors affect the evolution and expression of individually
   consistent behavior in nature. The framework is based on simple
   principles: first, information acquisition requires cognition that is
   inherently costly to build and maintain. Second, individual differences
   in animal cognition affect the differences in behavioral flexibility,
   i.e. the variance around the mean of the behavioral reaction norm, which
   defines plasticity. Third, along the lines of the evolution of
   cognition, we predict that environments with moderate variation favor
   behavioral flexibility. This occurs since in those environments costs of
   cognition are covered by being able to recognize and use information
   effectively. Similarly, nonflexible, stereotypic behaviors may be
   favored in environments that are either invariable or highly variable,
   since in those environments cognition does not give any benefits to
   cover the costs or cognition is not able to keep up with environmental
   change, respectively. If behavioral plasticity develops in response to
   increasing environmental variability, plasticity should dominate in
   environments that are moderately variable, and expression of animal
   personalities and behavioral syndromes may differ between environments.
   We give suggestions how to test our hypothesis and propose improvements
   to current behavioral testing protocols in the field of animal
   personality.}},

Abstract = {{A surging interest in the evolution of consistent trait correlations has
   inspired research on pigment patterns as a correlate of behavioural
   syndromes, or ``animal personalities{''}. Associations between
   pigmentation, physiology and health status are less investigated as
   potentially conserved trait clusters. In the current study, lice counts
   performed on farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar naturally infected with
   ectoparasitic sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis showed that individual
   fish with high incidence of black melanin-based skin spots harboured
   fewer female sea lice carrying egg sacs, compared to less pigmented
   fish. There was no significant association between pigmentation and lice
   at other developmental stages, suggesting that host factors associated
   with melanin-based pigmentation may modify ectoparasite development to a
   larger degree than settlement. In a subsequent laboratory experiment a
   strong negative correlation between skin spots and post-stress cortisol
   levels was revealed, with less pigmented individuals showing a more
   pronounced cortisol response to acute stress. The observation that lice
   prevalence was strongly increased on a fraction of sexually mature male
   salmon which occurred among the farmed fish further supports a role for
   steroid hormones as mediators of reduced parasite resistance. The data
   presented here propose steroid hormones as a proximate cause for the
   association between melanin-based pigmentation and parasites. Possible
   fundamental and applied implications are discussed.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in cognitive appraisal and emotional
   reactivity, including fearfulness, are important personality traits in
   humans, non-human mammals, and birds. Comparative studies on teleost
   fishes support the existence of coping styles and behavioral syndromes
   also in poikilothermic animals. The functionalist approach to emotions
   hold that emotions have evolved to ensure appropriate behavioral
   responses to dangerous or rewarding stimuli. Little information is
   however available on how evolutionary widespread these putative links
   between personality and the expression of emotional or affective states
   such as fear are. Here we disclose that individual variation in coping
   style predicts fear responses in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus,
   using the principle of avoidance learning. Fish previously screened for
   coping style were given the possibility to escape a signalled aversive
   stimulus. Fearful individuals showed a range of typically reactive
   traits such as slow recovery of feed intake in a novel environment,
   neophobia, and high post-stress cortisol levels. Hence, emotional
   reactivity and appraisal would appear to be an essential component of
   animal personality in species distributed throughout the vertebrate
   subphylum.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals store food in small, widely dispersed scatter hoards or in
   large larder hoards in burrows or other centralized locations. Kangaroo
   rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in
   food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used
   laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding
   by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys
   merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in
   arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and
   individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their
   behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some
   subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both
   species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding
   propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between
   males as well as greater variation between trials for individual
   females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace
   lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's
   kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding
   behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating
   strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache
   pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with
   differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This
   study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural
   plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and
   females. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Intermittent locomotion, characterized by moves interspersed with
   pauses, is a common pattern of locomotion in animals, but its ecological
   and evolutionary significance relative to continuous locomotion remains
   poorly understood. Although many studies have examined individual
   differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to
   our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship
   between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this
   relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are
   associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as
   foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we
   report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and
   intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in
   field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our
   results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level
   variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and
   labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with
   differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals
   spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses
   than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was
   correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the
   first empirical evidence for a link between an animal ``personality{''}
   trait and intermittent locomotion.}},

Title = {{A behavioral syndrome linking courtship behavior toward males and

Abstract = {{Suites of correlated behaviors, or ``behavioral syndromes,{''} have been
   shown to occur throughout the animal kingdom. Behavioral syndromes
   involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary
   ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to
   sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches
   (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice,
   and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified
   between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression
   directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an
   opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals
   exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction.
   Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior
   in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In
   contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing
   cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context.
   Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call
   ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between
   courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship
   directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context.
   Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive
   success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual
   selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context,
   may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{A suite of correlated behaviors reflecting between-individual
   consistency in behavior across multiple situations is termed a
   ``behavioral syndrome.{''} Researchers have suggested that a cause for
   the correlation between different behaviors might lie in the
   neuroendocrine system. In this study, we examined the relationships
   between aggressiveness (a fish's readiness to perform gill display to
   its mirror image) and each of boldness (the readiness to emerge from a
   shelter), exploratory tendency (the readiness to approach a novel
   shelter), and learning performance (the probability of entering the
   correct reservoir in a T-maze test) in a mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias
   marmoratus. We explored the possibility that the relationships between
   them arise because these behaviors are all modulated by cortisol and
   testosterone. We also tested the stability of the relationships between
   these behaviors shortly after using a winning or losing experience to
   alter individuals' aggressiveness. The results were that aggressiveness
   correlated positively with boldness and the tendency to explore, and
   that these three behavioral traits were all positively correlated with
   pre-experience testosterone levels. Aggressiveness and boldness also
   positively correlated with pre-experience cortisol levels; exploratory
   tendency did not. The relationship between aggressiveness and boldness
   appeared to be stronger than that between either of them and exploratory
   tendency. These results suggest that testosterone and cortisol play
   important roles in mediating the correlations between these behavioral
   traits. Learning performance was not significantly correlated with the
   other behavioral traits or with levels of testosterone or cortisol.
   Recent experience in contests influenced individuals' aggressiveness,
   tendency to explore, and learning performance but not their boldness;
   individuals that received a winning experience were quicker to display
   to their mirror image and performed better in the learning task but were
   slower to approach a novel object than were individuals that lost.
   Contest experience did not, however, significantly influence the
   relationships between aggressiveness and any of boldness, exploratory
   tendency, or learning performance. The results show that the individual
   components of a suite of correlated behaviors can preserve a flexibility
   to respond differently to environmental stimuli.}},

Title = {{Personality and body condition have additive effects on motivation to

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the adaptive
   evolution of personality, defined as inter-individual differences in
   behaviour that are consistent over time and across situations. For
   instance, the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that personality
   evolved as a behavioural correlate of life-history trajectories that
   vary within populations. Thus, proactivity, corresponding to higher
   exploratory tendencies or higher boldness levels, has been linked to
   higher productivity or mortality rates. However, the extent to which
   proactivity is associated with a higher motivation to forage remains
   poorly understood. Moreover, although personality and its effects on
   foraging behaviour are usually considered to be independent of any
   motivational or nutritional state, few studies so far have challenged
   this. Here we show that personality traits, both individually or
   combined using a principal component analysis, and body condition have
   additive effects on latency to feed following food deprivation in the
   Zebra Finch Taeniopygia guttata, with personality accounting for 41\%
   and body condition for about 20\% of the total variation in latency to
   feed. In accordance with the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, latency
   to feed was negatively related to the degree of proactivity and
   positively related to body condition. Thus, proactive individuals and
   individuals in poorer condition were quicker to start feeding after a
   period of food deprivation. The absence of a significant interaction
   between personality and body condition further suggests that the effect
   of personality was independent of body condition. We discuss the
   relevance of our results in relation to the different factors
   influencing foraging in birds. Moreover, we place our results within a
   life-history framework by emphasizing the correlated evolution of
   life-history traits and personality.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{284}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{198-205}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is highly variable between individuals
   within a single species and the relationship between body mass and RMR
   does not wholly explain this variability. One factor that could account
   for a portion of the residual variation is animal personality or
   consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, but no study has
   examined this relationship in a free-living population of mammals. In
   this paper, we test for a relationship between RMR and CIDs in activity
   in live-trapped meadow voles Microtus pennsylvanicus after controlling
   for the effect of body mass. We quantified the activity levels of voles
   both in an unfamiliar environment and for the first 2 min in the
   metabolic apparatus, and then measured RMR using open-flow respirometry.
   As expected, there was a linear relationship between RMR and body mass,
   and we found strong evidence for repeatable differences in activity
   levels between individuals. However, contrary to the hypothesis, we did
   not identify a significant correlation between CIDs in behaviour and RMR
   after controlling for body mass. Our results suggest that, at least
   within species, higher activity levels may not require a greater
   investment in energetically demanding tissues or increased capacity for
   processing of energy. Alternatively, if a relationship exists, our
   inability to detect it may reflect a weak behavioural signal in noisy
   RMR data that are influenced by many factors. Our results could also
   reflect an artefact of individual responses to stress or a sampling bias
   towards more exploratory individuals in animals captured by
   live-trapping.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in context-general behavioral
   traits (often called personality traits) are particularly interesting
   for behavioral ecologists because they might show unexpected
   cross-context correlations and explain maladaptive behavior. In order to
   understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the
   heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive
   success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain
   variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to
   novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment.
   Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic
   variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair
   paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and
   nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well
   as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects
   had little influence on these components of reproductive success.
   However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational
   sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel
   object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the
   sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual
   selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We
   conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive
   success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In a challenging situation some animals respond by active avoidance,
   aggression and an activation of the sympathetic nervous system whereas
   others respond by immobility, low levels of aggression and a predominant
   adrenocortical stress response. When consistent over time and across
   situations such inter-individual differences in behaviourul and
   physiological stress responses are referred to as stress coping
   strategies. In a previous study we reported the existence of two
   distinct stress coping strategies in a sea-ranched brown trout (Salmo
   trutta) population. Using the same method, we here show that four brown
   trout populations with different origin, but reared under identical
   conditions, differ in their endocrine stress response, behaviour during
   hypoxia and aggression. Further more, if individuals are classified as
   high- and low responsive based on post-stress blood plasma noradrenalin
   levels (indicator of sympathetic reactivity) the frequency distribution
   shows that populations with hatchery origin are biased towards having
   higher frequencies of high responsive individuals. However, the number
   of high responsive trout ranges from 14-48\% in the different
   populations which shows that generally the frequency is biased towards
   lower levels of high responsive individuals. We discuss different
   frequency-dependent mechanisms that maintain multiple phenotypes in
   populations and speculate about differences in selection regime among
   the studied populations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models are used to study the physiological mechanisms underlying
   disease progression. In this paper, I examine the benefits of using
   animal models to study how personality or stable individual differences
   (in behavior and physiology) influence disease susceptibility and
   resilience. Such an expansion of animal model use, to study the
   relationships among personality, physiology, and health, provides a
   unique complement to human studies. Human studies are necessarily
   correlational and involve minimally-invasive physiological measures,
   whereas animal studies can involve experimental manipulations of
   potentially causal variables. For example, with animal models, genetic
   and environmental precursors of personality can be manipulated to test
   how behavioral response biases affect health, and physiological
   parameters can be manipulated to observe resulting changes in behavioral
   traits and health. In addition to these experimental benefits, lifespan
   longitudinal studies can be conducted with short-lived animal models to
   address cumulative, potentially subtle effects of personality on health.
   In general, animal models allow for greater in-depth analyses of
   physiological processes underlying relationships between personality and
   health, and a means for determining causal mechanisms.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Examining the relevance of `animal personality' involves linking
   consistent among- and within-individual behavioural variation to fitness
   in the wild. Studies aiming to do this typically assay personality in
   captivity and rely on the assumption that measures of traits in the
   laboratory reflect their expression in nature. We examined this rarely
   tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the
   behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously
   monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the
   same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity. We focused
   on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies:
   shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in
   the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the
   expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did
   not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental
   factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed
   appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some
   behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately
   assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly
   context-specific. Our results highlight the importance of validating the
   relevance of laboratory behavioural assays to analogous traits measured
   in the wild.}},

   personality}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{The social environment influences animal personality on evolutionary and
   immediate time scales. However, studies of animal personality rarely
   assess the effects of the social environment, particularly in species
   that live in stable groups with individualized relationships. We
   assessed personality experimentally in 17 individuals of the common
   marmoset, living in four groups. We found their personality to be
   considerably modified by the social environment. Marmosets exhibited
   relatively high plasticity in their behaviour, and showed
   `group-personality', i.e. group-level similarity in the personality
   traits. In exploratory behaviour this was maintained only in the social
   environment but not when individuals were tested alone, suggesting that
   exploration tendency is subjected to social facilitation. Boldness, in
   contrast, showed higher consistency across the social and solitary
   conditions, and the group-level similarity in trait scores was sustained

   `group-personality' was not due to genetic relatedness, supporting that
   it was produced by social effects. We hypothesize that
   `group-personality' may be adaptive for highly cooperative animals
   through facilitating cooperation among individuals with similar

Abstract = {{Animal personalities (sometimes referred also as coping styles) and
   their fitness consequences are currently among the most intensively
   explored subjects in behavioral ecology. To estimate the evolvability
   and adaptability of individually consistent behavioral variation, there
   is a crucial need to quantify the genetics underlying personality. Here,
   we experimentally studied the repeatability of various individual
   behaviors and then estimated heritability of formed boldness,
   exploration, and aggression components in juvenile brown trout Salmo
   trutta in standardized laboratory environment. Principal component
   analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described
   by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and
   aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality
   components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were
   statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not
   the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low
   level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096). These results suggest that additive
   genetic variation underlies phenotypically consistent behavioral
   patterns, proposing that any selection acting on behavior, stress
   tolerance, or correlated traits has a potential to induce evolution in
   fish personality.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have revealed repeatable (among-individual) variance in
   behavioural traits consistent with variation in animal personality;
   however, these studies are often conducted using data collected over
   single sampling periods, most commonly with short time intervals between
   observations. Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level
   patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales
   and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain
   consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their
   lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population
   of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a
   multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual
   variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits
   repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field
   trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days
   between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time
   periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are
   repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a
   latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative
   differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a
   tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study,
   overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual
   behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At
   the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be
   informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g.
   lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and,
   at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual
   performance change significantly between data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Predator-induced stress responses are thought to reduce an animal's risk
   of being eaten. Therefore, these stress responses should enhance
   anti-predator behaviour. We found that individual insects (the cricket
   Gryllus texensis) show reliable behavioural responses (i.e. behavioural
   types) in a plus-shaped maze. An individual's behaviour in the plus maze
   remained consistent for at least 1/2 of its adult life. However, after
   exposure to a model predator, both male and female crickets showed a
   reduced period of immobility and an increased amount of time spent under
   shelter compared with controls. These changes could be mimicked by
   injections of the insect stress neurohormone octopamine. These
   behavioural changes probably aid crickets in evading predators. Exposure
   to a model predator increased the ability of crickets to escape a live
   predator (a bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps). An injection of
   octopamine had the same effect, showing that stress hormones can reduce
   predation. Using crickets to study the fitness consequences of
   predator-induced stress responses will help integrate ecological and
   biomedical concepts of `stress'.}},

Abstract = {{Animals within a population differ consistently in behavior over time
   and/or across conditions. A general question is how such differences
   referred to as personalities are maintained through evolution. One
   suggested mechanism is a nonrandom mate choice, which has been supported
   in species in which mate choice associates with direct material
   benefits. Much less is known about mating patterns and personality in
   species where males provide only sperm and in which the benefits of
   female choice are based only on good and/or compatible genes. The bridge
   spider Larinioides sclopetarius Clerck (Araneidae) exhibits heritable
   between-individual differences in intrasex aggressiveness. We studied
   mating probabilities by aggressiveness type of both sexes, and success
   in sperm competition of aggressive versus nonaggressive males. We staged
   trials that resemble field conditions: 4 males (2 aggressive and 2
   nonaggressive) had simultaneous choice between an aggressive and a
   nonaggressive female. Although there were no differences in initial
   approaches of male types toward female types, aggressive males mainly
   mated with aggressive females, and nonaggressive males more likely mated
   with nonaggressive females. Female aggressiveness type was not related
   to fecundity, which may be a consequence of equal food supply in the
   laboratory. However, in double-mating trials using the sterile-male
   technique to measure paternity of aggressive versus nonaggressive males,
   we found that sons of aggressive parents fathered relatively more
   offspring. We conclude that assortative mating by aggressiveness type
   might maintain between-individual differences in aggressiveness in L.
   sclopetarius.}},

Title = {{Weevil x Insecticide: Does `Personality' Matter?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{An insect's behavior is the expression of its integrated physiology in
   response to external and internal stimuli, turning insect behavior into
   a potential determinant of insecticide exposure. Behavioral traits may
   therefore influence insecticide efficacy against insects, compromising
   the validity of standard bioassays of insecticide activity, which are
   fundamentally based on lethality alone. By extension, insect
   `personality' (i.e., an individual's integrated set of behavioral
   tendencies that is inferred from multiple empirical measures) may also
   be an important determinant of insecticide exposure and activity. This
   has yet to be considered because the behavioral studies involving
   insects and insecticides focus on populations rather than on
   individuals. Even among studies of animal `personality', the relative
   contributions of individual and population variation are usually
   neglected. Here, we assessed behavioral traits (within the categories:
   activity, boldness/shyness, and exploration/avoidance) of individuals
   from 15 populations of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), an
   important stored-grain pest with serious problems of insecticide
   resistance, and correlated the behavioral responses with the activity of
   the insecticide deltamethrin. This analysis was performed at both the
   population and individual levels. There was significant variation in
   weevil `personality' among individuals and populations, but variation
   among individuals within populations accounted for most of the observed
   variation (92.57\%). This result emphasizes the importance of individual
   variation in behavioral and `personality' studies. When the behavioral
   traits assessed were correlated with median lethal time (LT50) at the
   population level and with the survival time under insecticide exposure,
   activity traits, particularly the distance walked, significantly
   increased survival time. Therefore, behavioral traits are important
   components of insecticide efficacy, and individual variation should be
   considered in such studies. This is so because population differences
   provided only crude approximation of the individual personality in a
   restrained experimental setting likely to restrict individual behavior
   favoring the transposition of the individual variation to the
   population.}},

Abstract = {{When engaged in behavioural games, animals can adjust their use of
   alternative tactics until groups reach stable equilibria. Recent theory
   on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should
   differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree
   of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be
   consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts.
   These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine
   the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura
   punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two
   different social foraging games: producer-scrounger (PS) and
   patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual
   differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two
   games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent
   over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month
   period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling
   behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The
   rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively
   associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC
   trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of
   pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an
   important component of this plasticity is group-and/or context-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Communication is a process in which senders provide information via
   signals and receivers respond accordingly. This process relies on two
   coevolving conventions: a ``sender code{''} that determines what kind of
   signal is to be sent given the sender's state; and a ``receiver code{''}
   that determines the appropriate responses to different signal types. By
   means of a simple but generic model, we show that polymorphic sender and
   receiver strategies emerge naturally during the evolution of
   communication, and that the number of alternative strategies observed at
   equilibrium depends on the potential for error in signal production. Our
   model suggests that alternative communication strategies will evolve
   whenever senders possess imperfect information about their own quality
   or state, signals are costly, and genetic mechanisms allow for a
   correlation between sender and receiver behavior. These findings provide
   an explanation for recent reports of individual differences in
   communication strategies, and suggest that the amount of individual
   variation that can be expected in communication systems depends on the
   type of information being conveyed. Our model also suggests a link
   between communication and the evolution of animal personalities, which
   is that individual differences in the production and interpretation of
   signals can result in consistent differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes describe consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioural traits. Quantifying individual differences
   often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity
   while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared
   behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and
   long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological
   contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was
   similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the
   presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap,
   respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel
   object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of
   annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home
   territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across
   ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a
   behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and
   exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in
   risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a
   familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate
   measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term
   responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in
   related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated
   ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context
   specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome
   sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide
   opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types,
   including trap-shy individuals. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Wild crickets show consistent patterns of behavior over their adult
   lifetimes and as they get older they become increasingly predictable. We
   tagged crickets and then periodically recaptured them and measured their
   behavior in the lab. This revealed that rather than variation in how age
   affects behavior, there were consistent patterns across the whole
   population. We do not have a situation where some crickets live fast and
   die young while others take it easy and slow.Investigating patterns of
   among and within-individual trait variation in populations is essential
   to understanding how selection shapes phenotypes. Behavior is often the
   most flexible aspect of the phenotype, and to understand how it is
   affected by selection, we need to examine how consistent individuals
   are. However, it is not well understood whether among-individual
   differences tend to remain consistent over lifetimes, or whether the
   behavior of individuals relative to one another varies over time. We
   examined the dynamics of 4 behavioral traits (tendency to leave a
   refuge, shyness, activity, and exploration) in a wild population of
   field crickets (Gryllus campestris). We tagged individuals and then
   temporarily removed them from their natural environment and tested them
   under laboratory conditions. All 4 traits showed among-individual
   variance in mean levels of expression across the adult lifespan, but no
   significant differences in how rapidly expression changed with age. For
   all traits, among-individual variance increased as individuals got
   older. Our findings reveal seldom examined changes in variance
   components over the adult lifetime of wild individuals. Such changes
   will have important implications for the relationship between behavioral
   traits, life-histories, and fitness and the consequences of selection on
   wild individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Highly plastic endocrine traits are thought to play a central role in
   allowing organisms to respond rapidly to environmental change. Yet, not
   all individuals display the same degree of plasticity in these traits,
   and the costs of this individual variation in plasticity are unknown. We
   studied individual differences in corticosterone levels under varying
   conditions to test whether there are consistent individual differences
   in (1) baseline corticosterone levels; (2) plasticity in the hormonal
   response to an ecologically relevant stressor (food restriction); and
   (3) whether individual differences in plasticity are related to fitness
   costs, as estimated by oxidative stress levels. We took 25 wild-caught
   house sparrows into captivity and assigned them to repeated food
   restricted and control treatments (60\% and 110\% of their daily food
   intake), such that each individual experienced both food restricted and
   control diets twice. We found significant individual variation in
   baseline corticosterone levels and stress responsiveness, even after
   controlling for changes in body mass. However, these individual
   differences in hormonal responsiveness were not related to measures of
   oxidative stress. These results have implications for how corticosterone
   levels may evolve in natural populations and raise questions about what

Abstract = {{Among factors hypothesized to favour consistent individual differences
   in behaviour (i.e. personality or behavioural types), the social
   environment has received relatively little attention. Within-group
   variation in personality may facilitate the emergence of division of
   labour, if individuals with different personalities tend to specialize
   on different tasks. In turn, functional benefits derived from division
   of labour may promote the coexistence of alternative behavioural types.
   We investigated how intracolonial variation in personality influences
   individual and collective patterns of task performance in the social
   spider Anelosimus studiosus. Colonies composed of a mixture of
   aggressive and docile females showed greater nonreproductive division of
   labour than monotypic colonies of either behavioural type. Within
   mixed-personality colonies, aggressive individuals tended to perform
   more prey capture, colony defence and/or web repair, while docile
   individuals became brood care specialists. Task differentiation was
   shaped by social dynamics, but behavioural plasticity varied with
   personality type: docile individuals were more socially responsive,
   shifting their task allocation in the presence of aggressive
   colonymates. Efficiency gains from personality-linked division of labour
   may help to explain the superior performance of diverse colonies and to
   maintain individual behavioural variation in A. studiosus and other
   social species. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The maintenance of genetic variation is a long-standing issue because
   the adaptive value of life-history strategies associated with each
   genetic variant is usually unknown. However, evidence for the
   coexistence of alternative evolutionary fixed strategies at the
   population level remains scarce. Because in the tawny owl (Strix aluco)
   heritable melanin-based coloration shows different physiological and
   behavioral norms of reaction, we investigated whether coloration is
   associated with investment in maintenance and reproduction. Light
   melanic owls had lower adult survival compared to dark melanic
   conspecifics, and color variation was related to the trade-off between
   offspring number and quality. When we experimentally enlarged brood
   size, light melanic males produced more fledglings but in poorer
   condition, and they were less often recruited in the local breeding
   population than those of darker melanic conspecifics. Our results also
   suggest that dark melanic males allocate a constant effort to raise
   their brood independently of environmental conditions, whereas lighter
   melanic males finely adjust reproductive effort in relation to changes
   in environmental conditions. Color traits can therefore be associated
   with life-history strategies, and stochastic environmental perturbation
   can temporarily favor one phenotype over others. The existence of fixed
   strategies implies that some phenotypes can sometimes display a
   ``maladapted{''} strategy. Long-term population monitoring is therefore
   vital for a full understanding of how different genotypes deal with
   trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{Ratings of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and orang-utan, Pongo pygmaeus
   and Pongo abelii, personality reveal dimensions resembling those found
   in humans. Critics have argued that this similarity derives from
   anthropomorphic projection or other rater-based effects. We developed
   two forms of data reduction analyses to determine whether these
   dimensions can best be explained by the inherent tendencies of the
   animals (e.g. orang-utans that are curious are playful) or
   anthropomorphic projections of raters (e.g. believing that orang-utans
   that are curious should be playful). We found that personality
   dimensions derived after differences between rater means and
   rater{*}item interactions had been removed from ratings replicated the
   previously discovered dimensions. Conversely, we found a different set
   of dimensions when analysing items from which differences between animal
   means and animal{*}item interactions had been removed. Finally, we used
   multilevel factor analysis to examine whether the published structure
   was replicated when we extracted factors based on the within-level
   animal differences in item scores effects while allowing between-rater
   differences to covary freely. Again, the personality dimensions were
   similar to those described in previous studies. These analyses can be
   used in combination with interrater reliability, temporal stability, and
   correlations between personality and other external variables to
   validate animal personality ratings. These analyses confirmed that
   personality similarities between humans and great apes are best
   explained by genetic and phylogenetic affinity and not by
   anthropomorphic artefacts. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Animals attacked by predators often enter a state of tonic immobility
   (TI) in which individuals appear to simulate death. Despite the fact
   that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals,
   quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild
   vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for
   the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we
   tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2
   components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the
   Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer
   montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in
   boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator
   models) or is simply related to variation in general
   activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We
   analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling
   (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to
   analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively
   high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures
   of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast,
   our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate
   can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI
   a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving
   personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition,
   we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to
   analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other
   approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more
   widely used.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Pages = {{601-622}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming clear that individual animals exhibit behaviours that are
   repeatable, consistent and predictable across various contexts and time,
   and that may be correlated to form behavioural syndromes. The influence
   of parasitism on host behaviour, although well-documented, is only now
   being examined in a multi-trait context, and behavioural syndromes
   provide a framework for such investigations. We test the hypothesis that
   parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the
   relationship between infection by four trematode species and the
   correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours
   (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus
   cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a
   significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these
   behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator
   cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were
   significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon
   sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test
   sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue.
   Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression
   was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis,
   Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the
   association depending on the behaviour tested. These findings suggest
   that behavioural syndromes may not only be targets for adaptive host
   manipulation by parasites, but also that, even if through mere
   pathology, parasites could act as external agents generating variation
   in behavioural syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Having recognized that variation around the population-level ``Golden
   Mean{''} of labile traits contains biologically meaningful information,
   behavioural ecologists have focused increasingly on exploring the causes
   and consequences of individual variation in behaviour. These are
   exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the
   adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the
   partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It
   has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random
   effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example,
   between a personality trait and other individual traits such as
   cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these
   predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried
   forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from
   these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the
   problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by
   behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist
   within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their
   implementation.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Novel selective pressures derived from human activities challenge the
   persistence of animal populations worldwide. Behavior is expected to be
   a major factor driving animals' responses to global change because it
   largely determines how animals interact with the environment. However,
   the role of individual variation in behavior to facilitate the
   persistence of animals in changing environments remains poorly
   understood. Here, we adopted an animal personality approach to
   investigate whether different behavioral traits allow animals to deal
   with two major components of global change: urbanization and biological
   invasions. By studying six populations of Anolis sagrei lizards, we
   found for the first time that anoles vary consistently in their behavior
   across different times and contexts. Importantly, these animal
   personalities were consistent in the wild and in captivity. We
   investigated whether behavioral traits are pulled in different
   directions by different components of global change. On the one hand, we
   found that lizards from urban areas differ from nearby forest lizards in
   that they were more tolerant of humans, less aggressive, bolder after a
   simulated predator attack, and they spent more time exploring new
   environments. Several of these risk-taking behaviors constituted a
   behavioral syndrome that significantly differed between urban and forest
   populations. On the other hand, the behavior of urban A.sagrei
   coexisting with the invasive predatory lizard Leiocephalus carinatus was
   associated with dramatic changes in their foraging niche. Overall, we
   provide evidence that differences in animal personalities facilitate the
   persistence of animals under novel selective regimes by producing
   adaptive behaviors relevant to their ecology such as predator avoidance.
   Our results suggest that natural selection can favor certain behaviors
   over others when animals are confronted with different ecological
   challenges posed by global change. Therefore, we underscore the need to
   incorporate behavioral ecology into the study of how animals adaptively
   respond to human-induced environmental changes.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Within a population, individuals can often exhibit consistent
   differences in a range of behaviors across time and context (behavioral
   type) that are also correlated (behavioral syndrome). Recently, it has
   been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its
   probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result,
   certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a
   non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications-from
   the way we conduct ecological research to the management and
   conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable?
   Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of
   passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival
   and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are
   typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in
   similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different
   trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing)
   in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a
   population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested
   whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant
   behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no
   difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5
   behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral
   syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an
   environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We
   suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be
   associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of
   animals to novelty.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding space use remains a major challenge for animal ecology,
   with implications for species interactions, disease spread, and
   conservation. Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of
   individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive
   individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to
   date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal
   depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent
   space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern
   Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS)
   tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays,
   and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge
   resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that
   lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the
   neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other
   conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially
   aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to
   ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of
   these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when
   food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For
   example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the
   season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these
   predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of
   heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic
   understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease
   dynamics and social structure.}},

Abstract = {{One explanation for animal personality is that different behavioural
   types derive from different life-history strategies. Highly productive
   individuals, with high growth rates and high fecundity, are assumed to
   live life at a fast pace showing high levels of boldness and risk
   taking, compared with less productive individuals. Here, we investigate
   among-individual differences in mean boldness (the inverse of the
   latency to recover from a startling stimulus) and in the consistency of
   boldness, in male hermit crabs in relation to two aspects of
   life-history investment. We assessed aerobic scope by measuring the
   concentration of the respiratory pigment haemocyanin, and we assessed
   fecundity by measuring spermatophore size. First, we found that
   individuals investing in large spermatophores also had high
   concentrations of haemocyanin. Using doubly hierarchical-generalized
   linear models to analyse longitudinal data on startle responses, we show
   that hermit crabs vary both in their mean response durations and in the
   consistency of their behaviour. Individual consistency was unrelated to
   haemocyanin concentration or spermatophore size, but mean startle
   response duration increased with spermatophore size. Thus, counter to
   expectations, it was the most risk-averse individuals, rather than the
   boldest and most risk prone, that were the most productive. We suggest
   that similar patterns should be present in other species, if the most
   productive individuals avoid risky behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive developmental plasticity allows individuals experiencing poor
   environmental conditions in early life to adjust their life-history
   strategy in order to prioritize short-term fitness benefits and maximize
   reproductive output in challenging environments. Much research has been
   conducted to test whether such adoption of a ``faster{''} life-history
   strategy is accompanied by concordant changes in behavior and
   physiology, with mixed results. As research in this field has focused on
   comparison of mean-level responses of treatment groups, few studies
   include repeated measures of response variables and the effect that
   developmental stress may have on repeatability per se. We investigated
   how early-developmental stress affects the mean expression of (and
   repeatability in) a variety of behavioral and physiological traits in
   female zebra finches. We predicted that: (1) individuals subjected to
   nutritional restriction in the nestling phase would have higher feeding
   and activity rates, with associated increases in hematocrit and basal
   metabolic rates (BMRs), (2) nutritional restriction in early life would
   alter adults' stress-induced corticosterone level, and (3) developmental
   stress would, respectively, influence the amount of among-individual and
   within-individual variation in behavioral and physiological traits,
   hence affecting the repeatability of these traits. In comparison to
   control females, stressed females did not differ in activity rate or
   stress-induced corticosterone level, but they did have higher levels of
   feeding, hematocrit, and BMR. Among-individual variance and
   repeatability were generally higher in stressed females than in
   controls. Finally, we found that developmental dietary restriction
   significantly reduced the amount of within-individual variance both in
   activity rate in the novel environment and in stress-induced
   corticosterone level. Our results not only confirm previous findings on
   the effect of early-developmental stress on BMR, but also extend its
   effect to feeding rate and hematocrit, suggesting that developmental
   plasticity in these traits is ontogenetically linked.
   Early-developmental stress may disable particular genetic canalizing
   processes, which would release cryptic genetic variation and explain why
   repeatability and among-individual variance were generally higher in the
   stressed groups than in controls. For activity rate in the novel
   environment and with stress-induced corticosterone level, however,
   early-developmental stress significantly reduced within-individual
   variance, which may be a consequence of increased canalization of these
   traits at the micro-environmental level.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that individual behavioural traits influence the
   potential to successfully colonize new areas. Identifying the genetic
   basis of behavioural variation in invasive species thus represents an
   important step towards understanding the evolutionary potential of the
   invader. Here, we sequenced a candidate region for neophilic/neophobic
   and activity behaviour - the complete exon 3 of the DRD4 gene - in 100
   Yellow-crowned bishops (Euplectes afer) from two invasive populations in
   Spain and Portugal. The same birds were scored twice for activity
   behaviour while exposed to novel objects (battery or slice of apple) in
   captivity. Response to novel objects was repeatable (r=0.41) within
   individuals. We identified two synonymous DRD4SNPs that explained on
   average between 11\% and 15\% of the phenotypic variance in both
   populations, indicating a clear genetic component to the
   neophilic/neophobic/activity personality axis in this species. This
   consistently high estimated effect size was mainly due to the repeated
   measurement design, which excludes part of the within-individual
   nongenetic variance in the response to different novel objects. We
   suggest that the alternative alleles of these SNPs are likely introduced
   from the original population and maintained by weak or antagonistic
   selection during different stages of the invasion process. The
   identified genetic variants have not only the potential to serve as
   genetic markers of the neophobic/neophilic/activity personality axis,
   but may also help to understand the evolution of behaviour in these
   invasive bird populations.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour, or animal
   personality, are emerging as an important determinant of a wide range of
   life history traits and fitness. Individual behaviour, however, may be
   constrained by between-individual variability in energy metabolism and
   may become unstable owing to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Here we
   tested the relationship between personality and physiology using
   wild-caught bank voles, Myodes glareolus, that varied according to mtDNA
   type (original or introgressed from Myodes rutilus). Personality traits
   and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open
   field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow
   respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals'
   consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis
   score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their
   consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however,
   this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males
   with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive
   behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating
   that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly
   behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed
   males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the
   alternative compensation model. According to our findings, it is likely
   that consistent differences in behavioural patterns and mtDNA types
   promote variation between individuals in energy metabolism. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Blue tit females that defend themselves aggressively are passive when
   they defend offspring, but this relationship is opposite in males. Our
   findings imply that the 2 sexes differentially value themselves versus
   their young possibly because of the different reproductive roles they
   have.The direction of covariation in behavioral traits (a behavioral
   syndrome) is typically the same in males and females, although
   intersexual differences in life history could lead to intersexual
   heterogeneity in syndrome structure. We explored whether a behavioral
   syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest
   defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a
   female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest
   defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days
   old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated
   records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during
   2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the
   between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1)
   hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly
   repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38\%
   repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females
   that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when
   being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling
   defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual
   correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were
   completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation.
   Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive
   behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may
   differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal
   personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our
   findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this

Abstract = {{Territorial aggression influences fitness and, in monogamous pairs, the
   behavior of both individuals could impact reproductive success.
   Moreover, territorial aggression is particularly important in the
   context of interspecific competition. Tree swallows and eastern
   bluebirds are highly aggressive, secondary cavity-nesting birds that
   compete for limited nesting sites. We studied eastern bluebirds at a
   field site in the southern Appalachian Mountains that has been recently
   colonized (<40 yr) by tree swallows undergoing a natural range
   expansion. The field site is composed of distinct areas where bluebirds
   compete regularly with tree swallows and areas where there is little
   interaction between the two species. Once birds had settled, we measured
   how interspecific competition affects the relationship between
   assortative mating (paired individuals that behave similarly) and
   reproductive success in eastern bluebirds. We found a strong tendency
   toward assortative mating throughout the field site. In areas of high
   interspecific competition, pairs that behaved the most similarly and
   displayed either extremely aggressive or extremely non-aggressive
   phenotypes experienced higher reproductive success. Our data suggest
   that interspecific competition with tree swallows may select for
   bluebirds that express similar behavior to that of their mate.
   Furthermore, animal personality may be an important factor influencing
   the outcome of interactions between native and aggressive, invasive
   species.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that behavioral tendencies, or
   ``personalities,{''} in animals are an important aspect of their
   biology, yet their evolutionary basis is poorly understood.
   Specifically, how individual variation in personality arises and is
   subsequently maintained by selection remains unclear. To address this
   gap, studies of personality require explicit incorporation of genetic
   information. Here, we explored the genetic basis of personality in
   rhesus macaques by determining the heritability of personality
   components and by examining the fitness consequences of those
   components. We collected observational data for 108 adult females living
   in three social groups in a free-ranging population via focal animal
   sampling. We applied principal component analysis to nine spontaneously
   occurring behaviors and identified six putative personality components,
   which we named Meek, Bold, Aggressive, Passive, Loner, and Nervous. All
   components were repeatable and heritable, with heritability estimates
   ranging from 0.14 to 0.35. We found no evidence of an association with
   reproductive output, measured either by infant survival or by interbirth
   interval, for any of the personality components. This finding suggests
   either that personality does not have fitness-related consequences in
   this population or that selection has acted to reduce fitness-associated
   variation in personality.}},

   life}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Animals show consistent individual behavioural patterns over
   time and over situations. This phenomenon has been referred to as animal
   personality or behavioural syndromes. Little is known about consistency
   of animal personalities over entire life times. We investigated the
   repeatability of behaviour in common voles (Microtus arvalis) at
   different life stages, with different time intervals, and in different
   situations. Animals were tested using four behavioural tests in three
   experimental groups: 1. before and after maturation over three months,
   2. twice as adults during one week, and 3. twice as adult animals over
   three months, which resembles a substantial part of their entire adult
   life span of several months.
   Results: Different behaviours were correlated within and between tests
   and a cluster analysis showed three possible behavioural syndrome-axes,
   which we name boldness, exploration and activity. Activity and
   exploration behaviour in all tests was highly repeatable in adult
   animals tested over one week. In animals tested over maturation,
   exploration behaviour was consistent whereas activity was not. Voles
   that were tested as adults with a three-month interval showed the
   opposite pattern with stable activity but unstable exploration
   behaviour.
   Conclusions: The consistency in behaviour over time suggests that common
   voles do express stable personality over short time. Over longer periods
   however, behaviour is more flexible and depending on life stage (i.e.
   tested before/after maturation or as adults) of the tested individual.
   Level of boldness or activity does not differ between tested groups and
   maintenance of variation in behavioural traits can therefore not be
   explained by expected future assets as reported in other studies.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral differences among individuals are common and are organized
   into personalities in a wide variety of species. Hypotheses for the
   coexistence of behavioral differences fall into 3 categories: variation
   in selection, frequency-dependent selection, and behavioral plasticity.
   We tested predictions of those hypotheses regarding geographic
   covariation of behavior with ecology, using a recent (40 years)
   biological invasion of common waxbills (Estrilda astrild). Behavior in
   tests for exploration and social interaction covaried among individuals,
   suggesting a behavioral syndrome, although we could only demonstrate
   within-individual repeatability in the test for social interaction.
   These 2 behaviors changed geographically with the ecology of sites
   (degree of climate variation) in an apparently adaptive way, rather than
   with the direction of invasion. We found behavioral plasticity but
   showed that short-term plastic effects do not explain geographic
   divergence. Differential dispersal does not explain geographic
   divergence either, which is orthogonal to the direction of invasion.
   Results are best interpreted either as evolved divergences, although a
   candidate-gene approach could not identify genetic correlates of
   behavior, or as long-term behavioral plasticity (e.g., effects of
   rearing environment). In this recent invasion, geographic differences in
   ecology and behavior equate to repeated and fast changes over time.
   Thus, fluctuations in ecological conditions, which are common in nature,
   may have a widespread role maintaining behavioral and personality
   differences via selection and/or long-term behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in animal personality because individual

   revelations that personality traits affect key fitness variables, little
   is known about the proximate mechanisms generating consistent

   take risks, is one of the most widely studied aspects of personality in
   fishes. We assessed the position of juvenile Argyosomus japonicus on the
   ``boldness-shyness{''} continuum by repeatedly recording the time taken
   to exit a refuge and explore a novel environment. Stress-related hormone
   concentrations after exposure to a mild stressor were analysed 1 month
   before behavioural assays and found to be significantly linked to
   boldness scores. Shy fish had significantly higher plasma cortisol
   concentrations in response to handling stress than bold fish.
   Spontaneous switching between personality categories occurred between
   trials, highlighting the importance of repeated testing of personality

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour are widespread in
   animals, but the proximate mechanisms driving these differences remain
   largely unresolved. Parasitism and immune challenges are hypothesized to
   shape the expression of animal personality traits, but few studies have
   examined the influence of neonatal immune status on the development of
   adult personality. We examined how non-pathogenic immune challenges,
   administered at different stages of development, affected two common
   measures of personality, activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as
   colour-dependent novel object exploration in adult male mallard ducks
   (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that individuals that were
   immune-challenged during the middle (immediately following the
   completion of somatic growth) and late (during the acquisition of
   nuptial plumage) stages of development were more active in novel
   environments as adults relative to developmentally unchallenged birds or
   those challenged at an earlier developmental time point. Additionally,
   individuals challenged during the middle stage of development preferred
   orange and avoided red objects more than those that were not
   immune-challenged during development. Our results demonstrate that, in
   accordance with our predictions, early-life immune system perturbations
   alter the expression of personality traits later in life, emphasizing
   the role that developmental plasticity plays in shaping adult
   personality, and lending support to recent theoretical models that
   suggest that parasite pressure may play an important role in animal
   personality development.}},

Abstract = {{Many aspects of an animal's early development might potentially
   contribute to long-term individual differences in physiology and
   behavior. Here we asked whether differences among littermates of the
   domestic rabbit in the position in the litter huddle that they occupy
   during the early nest period might contribute to the development of
   distinct behavioral and physiological phenotypes. In each of 12 litters
   we determined the pup occupying the most peripheral, the most central,
   and an intermediate position in the huddle during the first postnatal
   week. We then tested the responses of these same individuals as
   nestlings, juveniles and young adults when confronted by a range of
   age-appropriate environmental challenges. Two behavioral tests appeared
   particularly discriminatory in identifying differences associated with
   early position in the huddle; latency of pre-weaning pups to jump down
   from a shelf, and the response of young adults to the fearful screams of
   a conspecific. In both cases animals that had occupied the periphery of
   the huddle showed behavioral responses indicative of a more proactive
   behavioral style than their ``intermediate{''} or ``central{''}
   littermates. We conclude that while consistent long-term differences in
   behavioral style associated with early position in the litter huddle
   exist in rabbits, future work is needed to confirm the causal nature of
   this association, to identify underlying mechanisms, and to refine
   methods of behavioral and physiological testing across the life span.

Abstract = {{Where behavioural responses differ consistently between individuals,
   this is termed `personality'. There is the suggestion, but with little
   supporting data, that personality traits reflect underlying variation in
   physiology. Here, we tested whether greenfinches Carduelis chloris
   differing in personality traits differed in various plasma indices of
   oxidative profile: antioxidant capacity (OXY), pro-oxidant status
   (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs), oxidative stress (OS) and an
   end-product of oxidative damage: malondialdehyde (MDA). We measured two
   personality traits: neophobia (latency to approach food near novel
   objects) and object exploration (latency to approach novel objects).
   These traits were uncorrelated. ROMs, OXY, OS and MDA were also
   uncorrelated with each other. Highly neophobic birds had lower OXY,
   higher ROMs and higher OS than less neophobic birds. Fast exploring
   birds had higher OXY than slow explorers, but did not differ in ROMs or
   OS. Variation in MDA was described by a quadratic relationship with
   neophobia: birds with extremely high or low neophobia had lower MDA than
   birds with intermediate neophobia, despite highly neophobic birds
   exhibiting lower OS than intermediately neophobic birds. Additively in
   that model, fast explorers had lower MDA than slower explorers. To
   conclude: first, personality types can differ in oxidative profile.
   Second, although physiological differences (e. g. hormonal stress
   responsiveness) between personality types generally range along a linear
   continuum, physiological costs may not. Finally, relationships with
   oxidative profile differed between neophobia and object exploration.
   Understanding how oxidative profile and thus physiological costs vary
   within and between personality traits may explain how differences in
   personality traits can predict fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are interindividual behavioral differences that are
   consistent across time or contexts. Increasing research is revealing the
   adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving
   this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in
   personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of
   selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured
   indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally
   sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information
   currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability.
   We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common
   personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of
   rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific
   measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of
   hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3
   measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal
   consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed
   was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only
   repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These
   differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the
   correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial
   number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas
   population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel
   environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since
   capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of
   using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of
   personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational
   patterns of trait repeatability.}},

Journal = {{MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Psychometric findings are reported from two studies concerning the
   construct validity, temporal stability, and interrater reliability of
   the latent common factors underlying subjective assessments by human
   raters of personality traits in two nonhuman animal species: (a) the
   Stumptail macaque (Macaca arctoides), a cercopithecine monkey; and (b)
   the Zebra finch (Poephila guttata), an estrildid songbird. Because most
   theories of animal personality have historically implied that certain
   personality constructs should be relatively universal across taxa,
   parallel analyses of similar data are reported for two phylogenetically
   distant species of subject using the same psychometric methods. Each of
   the samples was drawn from a socially-housed colony of the same species:
   that of macaques consisted of 5 mature adult fem ales and 8 of their
   adult offspring and that of finches consisted of 5 adult individuals. A
   modified version of the 1978 Stevenson-Hinde and Zunz (SHZ) list of
   personality items was applied to the macaques at various times during
   the eight years from 1980-1988 and to the finches during 1992. This
   study also used the three SHZ scales - Confident, Excitable, and
   Sociable - originally derived from principal components.
   Generalizability analyses were used to assess the construct validity,
   temporal stability, and interrater reliability of the hypothesized
   factors. Both Stumptail macaques and Zebra finches manifest measurable
   personality factors that are highly valid across multiple items, stable
   across multiple years, and reliable across multiple raters. The same
   model fits both species, as predicted by theory. The construct validity
   of the factors is slightly higher for the finches than for the macaques,
   although the interrater reliability is somewhat lower. This study
   illustrates how generalizability analysis can be used to test
   prespecified confirmatory factor models when the number of individual
   subjects is quite small.}},

Abstract = {{1. Labile characters allow individuals to flexibly adjust their
   phenotype to changes in environmental conditions. There is growing
   evidence that individuals can differ both in average expression and
   level of plasticity in this type of character. Both of these aspects are
   studied in conjunction within a reaction norm framework.
   2. Theoreticians have investigated the factors promoting variation in
   reaction norm intercepts (average phenotype) and slopes (level of
   plasticity) of a key labile character: behaviour. A general prediction
   from their work is that selection will favour the evolution of
   repeatable individual variation in level of plasticity only under
   certain ecological conditions. While factors promoting individual
   repeatability of plasticity have thus been identified, empirical
   estimates of this phenomenon are largely lacking for wild populations.
   3. We assayed aggressiveness of individual male great tits (Parus major)
   twice during their egg-laying stage and twice during their
   egg-incubation stage to quantify each male's level of seasonal
   plasticity. This procedure was applied during six consecutive years; all
   males breeding in our plots during those years were assayed, resulting
   in repeated measures of individual reaction norms for any individual
   breeding in multiple years. We quantified among-and within-individual
   variation in reaction norm components, allowing us to estimate
   repeatability of seasonal plasticity. Using social pedigree information,
   we further partitioned reaction norm components into their additive
   genetic and permanent environmental counterparts.
   4. Cross-year individual repeatability for the intercepts (average
   aggressiveness) and slopes (level of seasonal plasticity) of the
   aggressiveness reaction norms were 0.574 and 0.516 respectively. The
   mean of the posterior distributions suggested modest heritabilities
   (h(2) = 0.260 for intercepts; h(2) = 0.266 for slopes), but these
   estimates were relatively uncertain. Males behaved more aggressively in
   areas with higher breeding densities, and became less aggressive and
   less plastic with increasing age; plasticity thus varied within
   individuals and was multidimensional in nature.
   5. This empirical study quantified cross-year individual repeatability,
   heritability and agerelated reversible plasticity in behaviour.
   Acknowledging such patterns of multi-level variation is important not
   only for testing behavioural ecology theory concerning the evolution of
   repeatable differences in behavioural plasticity but also for predicting
   how reversible plasticity may evolve in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in hormone levels and metabolic rates
   have been proposed to be potential state variables underlying consistent
   individual differences in behaviour (i.e. animal personality). However,
   it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential
   state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We
   address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird
   species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual
   differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability
   estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we
   quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates
   and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability
   estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low
   repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that
   metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating
   adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i)
   for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing
   interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed
   in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone
   levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now
   required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic
   rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try
   to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the
   relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In
   addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of
   variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability
   estimates because these two indices carry different information. We
   discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies,
   including meta-analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to a growing interest in the ecological implications of
   consistent individual differences in behavior, it is still unclear how
   consistent those differences are across environmental gradients,
   especially under ecologically relevant contexts and timescales. We
   investigated how individual variation in swimming activity of Eurasian
   perch (Perca fluviatilis) changes in response to natural fluctuations of
   water temperature as a proxy for an ecological gradient for ectothermic
   animals. Using an automated acoustic telemetry system, we tracked
   individual positions of adult perch in a whole natural lake for about 1
   year and compared several model frameworks for the individual responses
   to water temperature. The best-fit model revealed that rising water
   temperature led to an increase in both between-and within-individual
   variation in activity, thereby stabilizing behavioral repeatability
   across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation
   significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent
   individual differences in behavior could be partially explained by
   factors such as slowly changing states in the wild. By using
   ecologically relevant data, our results revealed complex patterns of
   behavioral variation in response to an environmental change represented
   by water temperature.}},

Abstract = {{In animal contests, individuals respond plastically to the phenotypes of
   the opponents that they confront. These ``opponent{''}aEuro{''}or
   ``indirect{''}aEuro{''}effects are often repeatable, for example,
   certain opponents consistently elicit more or less aggressiveness in
   others. ``Personality{''} (repeatable among-individual variation in
   behavior) has been proposed as an important source of indirect effects.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male
   field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring
   aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in
   nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask
   whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity,
   exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a
   behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing
   direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects.
   Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes
   indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology
   and evolution of behavior.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral repeatability is an important trait relevant to personality
   research and to behavioral ecology in general. We examined here the
   behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and
   edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge).
   We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine
   whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and
   whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than
   larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral
   repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae
   and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These
   findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably
   reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during
   metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral
   repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young
   adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained
   similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on
   repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two
   pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for
   the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual
   differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a
   shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was
   also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable
   than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may
   be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies.
   We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in
   insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual
   behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage,
   and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question
   has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full
   metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an
   opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous
   results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial
   metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important,
   because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This
   is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on
   differences between males and females, probably indicating on
   differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging.
   Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been
   already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Describing and quantifying animal personality is now an integral part of
   behavioural studies because individually distinctive behaviours have
   ecological and evolutionary consequences. Yet, to fully understand how
   personality traits may respond to selection, one must understand the
   underlying heritability and genetic correlations between traits.
   Previous studies have reported a moderate degree of heritability of
   personality traits, but few of these studies have either been conducted
   in the wild or estimated the genetic correlations between personality
   traits. Estimating the additive genetic variance and covariance in the
   wild is crucial to understand the evolutionary potential of behavioural
   traits. Enhanced environmental variation could reduce heritability and
   genetic correlations, thus leading to different evolutionary
   predictions. We estimated the additive genetic variance and covariance
   of docility in the trap, sociability (mirror image stimulation), and
   exploration and activity in two different contexts (open-field and
   mirror image simulation experiments) in a wild population of
   yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We estimated both
   heritability of behaviours and of personality traits and found nonzero
   additive genetic variance in these traits. We also found nonzero
   maternal, permanent environment and year effects. Finally, we found four
   phenotypic correlations between traits, and one positive genetic
   correlation between activity in the open-field test and sociability. We
   also found permanent environment correlations between activity in both
   tests and docility and exploration in the MIS test. This is one of a
   handful of studies to adopt a quantitative genetic approach to explain
   variation in personality traits in the wild and, thus, provides
   important insights into the potential variance available for selection.}},

Abstract = {{Behavior of wild vertebrate individuals can vary in response to
   environmental or social factors. Such within-individual behavioral
   variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve
   as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal
   personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and
   social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral
   traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among
   individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating
   among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones
   are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed
   hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether
   hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual's
   phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to
   improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships
   between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will
   determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To
   address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones,
   corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate
   behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate
   on among-individual variation and present examples for how variation in
   corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as
   exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review
   studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness,
   and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At
   the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our
   understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of
   behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to
   characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to
   environments.
   In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships
   between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using
   testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for
   testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these
   models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss
   approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between
   testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm
   approaches might be a fruitful way forward.
   We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm
   approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to
   make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the
   functional implications and the evolution of hormone-behavior
   relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals.
   This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat
   alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the
   mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust
   hormonally-mediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of evolutionary behavioural ecologists has recently turned
   towards understanding the causes and consequences of behavioural
   consistency, manifesting either as animal personality (consistency in a
   single behaviour) or behavioural syndrome (consistency across more
   behaviours). Behavioural type (mean individual behaviour) has been
   linked to life-history strategies, leading to the emergence of the
   integrated pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) theory. Using Rana dalmatina
   tadpoles as models, we tested if behavioural consistency and POLS could
   be detected during the early ontogenesis of this amphibian. We targeted
   two ontogenetic stages and measured activity, exploration and
   risk-taking in a common garden experiment, assessing both individual
   behavioural type and intra-individual behavioural variation. We observed
   that activity was consistent in all tadpoles, exploration only became
   consistent with advancing age and risk-taking only became consistent in
   tadpoles that had been tested, and thus disturbed, earlier. Only
   previously tested tadpoles showed trends indicative of behavioural
   syndromes. We found an activity-age at metamorphosis POLS in the
   previously untested tadpoles irrespective of age. Relative growth rate
   correlated positively with the intra-individual variation of activity of
   the previously untested older tadpoles. In previously tested older
   tadpoles, intra-individual variation of exploration correlated
   negatively and intra-individual variation of risk-taking correlated
   positively with relative growth rate. We provide evidence for
   behavioural consistency and POLS in predator-and conspecific-naive
   tadpoles. Intra-individual behavioural variation was also correlated to
   life history, suggesting its relevance for the POLS theory. The strong
   effect of moderate disturbance related to standard behavioural testing
   on later behaviour draws attention to the pitfalls embedded in repeated
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history trade-offs are considered a major driving force in the
   emergence of consistent behavioural differences (personality variation);
   but empirical tests are scarce. We investigated links between a
   personality trait (escape response), life-history and state variables
   (growth rate, size and age at first reproduction, age-dependent
   reproductive rates, lifetime reproductive success, life span) in red and
   green colour morphs of clonal pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Escape
   response (dropping/non-dropping off a plant upon a predatory attack) was
   measured repeatedly to classify individuals as consistent droppers,
   consistent nondroppers or inconsistents. Red morphs experienced stronger
   trade-offs between early reproduction and life span than green morphs;
   and red consistent (non)droppers had highest lifetime reproductive
   success. Red droppers followed a risk-averse life-history strategy (high
   late reproduction), red nondroppers a risk-prone strategy (high early
   reproduction), while reproductive rates were equivalent for all green
   behavioural types and red inconsistents. This suggests that red morphs
   suffer the highest costs of dropping (they are most conspicuous to
   predators), which equivalates' fitness payoffs to both risk-takers (red
   non-droppers) and risk-averse red droppers. The strong trade-off also
   means that committing to a particular lifestyle (being consistent)
   maximises fitness. Our study suggests that life-history trade-offs
   likely mediate personality variation but effects might depend on
   interactions with other organismal characteristics (here: colour morph).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{815-825}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The social niche specialization hypothesis predicts that group-living
   animals should specialize in particular social roles to avoid social
   conflict, resulting in alternative life-history strategies for different
   roles. Social niche specialization, coupled with role-specific
   life-history trade-offs, should thus generate between-individual
   differences in behaviour that persist through time, or distinct
   personalities, as individuals specialize in particular nonoverlapping
   social roles. We tested for support for the social niche specialization
   hypothesis in cooperative personality traits in wild female meerkats
   (Suricata suricatta) that compete for access to dominant social roles.
   As cooperation is costly and dominance is acquired by heavier females,
   we predicted that females that ultimately acquired dominant roles would
   show noncooperative personality types early in life and before and after
   role acquisition. Although we found large individual differences in
   repeatable cooperative behaviours, there was no indication that
   individuals that ultimately acquired dominance differed from
   unsuccessful individuals in their cooperative behaviour. Early-life
   behaviour did not predict social role acquisition later in life, nor was
   cooperative behaviour before and after role acquisition correlated in
   the same individuals. We suggest that female meerkats do not show social
   niche specialization resulting in cooperative personalities, but that
   they exhibit an adaptive response in personality at role acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of animal personality (i.e. consistent
   behavioural differences) is a major aim of evolutionary studies.
   Recent theoretical work suggests that major personality traits may
   contribute to evolutionary trade-offs. However, such associations have
   only been investigated in a few study systems, and even less so in free
   ranging animal populations.
   Eastern chipmunks exhibit consistent individual differences in
   exploration, ranging from slow to fast. Birth cohorts also experience
   dramatic differences in age at first breeding opportunity due to annual
   differences in beech mast. Individuals may breed for the first time at
   24, 33 or 50\% of their average life span, depending on year of birth.
   Here, we used data from a long-term survey on a wild population to
   investigate the relationship between reproductive life history and
   consistent individual differences in exploration. We determined whether
   predictable differences in age at first breeding opportunity among birth
   cohorts were associated with exploration differences and favoured
   individuals with different exploration.
   Birth cohorts with a predictably earlier age at first breeding
   opportunity were faster explorers on average. Slower explorers displayed
   their highest fecundity (females) or highest fertilization success
   (males) later in their life compared with faster explorers. Overall,
   slow explorers attained a higher lifetime reproductive success than fast
   explorers when given an opportunity to reproduce later in their life.
   Our results suggest that the timing of mating seasons, associated with
   fluctuating food abundance, may favour individual variation in
   exploration and maintain population variation through its effects on
   reproductive life history. Together, our result shed light on how
   fluctuation in ecological conditions may maintain personality
   differences and on the nature of the relationships between animal
   personality and life history.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit personality types, for example, with some
   individuals being consistently more aggressive and more willing to
   explore novel situations than others. Here, we show that although
   individual zebrafish do not show distinct personality types, whole
   populations of wild zebrafish do. Zebrafish from some populations were
   both bold and aggressive, whereas zebrafish from other areas were not.
   Our work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into
   higher order phenomena such as clade diversification.Many animals
   exhibit personality types, for example, with some individuals being
   consistently both more aggressive and more willing to explore novel
   situations than others. Often those behavioral syndromes are shaped by
   pleiotropic genetic and physiological mechanisms or joint selective
   pressures that constrain variation within and between 2 seemingly
   different types of behavior. Here, we used wild zebrafish to ask whether
   the behavioral syndromes typically measured within populations also
   occur across populations, as might be expected for syndromes created by
   forces such as a hormone with multiple effects. We found major
   differences across populations in both aggression and boldness.
   Zebrafish captured in the wild from running streams in Northern India
   were both bold and aggressive, approaching predators and conspecifics
   more frequently than did zebrafish from slower moving irrigation canals
   or a large, still, lake near Kolkata, India. We did not find any sites
   that were bold, but not aggressive, or aggressive, but not bold,
   suggesting that these behavioral combinations are not physiologically
   possible or that they are eliminated by population-level selection.
   Within populations, however, we found evidence for an
   aggression-boldness syndrome within only 1 of 5 measured populations
   (from an irrigation canal). Zebrafish also became markedly more
   aggressive after 3 months in a laboratory environment. These results
   offer a natural example of population-level personality types in wild
   organisms and show that population-level patterns and environmental
   plasticity may be as important as within-population constraints. Our
   work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into
   higher order phenomena such as clade diversification and selection.}},

Title = {{Disassortative mating for boldness decreases reproductive success in the

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in personality or temperament have
   been observed in many animal taxa, and one particular trait, boldness,
   has been studied extensively. Most studies on mate choice and
   personality have focused on female preference and have showed that
   females prefer to mate with bolder males. However, the influence of the
   females personality on this mate preference and on her compatibility
   with a mate with particular traits has been largely neglected. Here,
   using the guppy Poecilia reticulata, we investigated the effect of
   female boldness on mate choice and of the combinations of this trait in
   the male and female of a mating pair on parturition and brood size. Our
   results showed that female boldness did not affect mate choice, and
   brood size was independent of the boldness of the male and female in a
   pair. However, overall, females who mated with males with a dissimilar
   degree of boldness to themselves had a lower parturition success than
   females who mated with males with a similar degree of boldness. This
   work suggests that the combination of boldness characteristics within a
   pair influences reproductive success and that individuals of similar
   personality are more compatible in reproduction. The lower success of
   disassortative matings is consistent with the hypothesis that variation
   in personalities is maintained by disruptive or frequency-dependent
   selection, driven by contrasting physical or social environments that
   favor alternative rather than intermediate behavioral phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Studies increasingly explore whether there is variation between
   individuals in how they adjust their behavior to different environmental
   contexts using random regression analysis (RR). RR estimates the
   between-individual variance in elevation (expected behavior in the mean
   environment) and variance in plasticity (individual-specific adjustment
   of behavior to the environment) and the covariance between these
   properties. These (co)variances allow deriving both environment-specific
   repeatability estimates and the individual-level correlation in behavior
   between environmental conditions, both of which are of key interest for
   understanding consistency in behavior over space and time, a core issue
   in animal personality research. However, very few studies use the RR
   estimates to produce this information. In this paper, I outline how to
   extract this information (including example code in R) and apply the
   approach to 16 estimates based on nine published RR studies. Despite the
   fact that the behaviors have a decent repeatability under different
   environmental conditions, I find that in half the cases, the
   cross-environmental correlation is low (< 0.4). This implies that
   individuals differ in their behavioral trait values but that the ranking
   of these individual values tends to change between environmental
   conditions. This level of inconsistency in animal personality traits
   appears not to have been fully appreciated, and future studies on
   plasticity using RR should explicitly include it.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of genetic architecture and selection history in genes
   for behavioural traits is fundamental to our understanding of how these
   traits evolve. The dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene is a prime candidate
   for explaining genetic variation in novelty seeking behaviour, a
   commonly assayed personality trait in animals. Previously, we showed
   that a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene is
   associated with exploratory behaviour in at least one of four Western
   European great tit (Parus major) populations. These heterogeneous
   association results were explained by potential variable linkage
   disequilibrium (LD) patterns between this marker and the causal variant
   or by other genetic or environmental differences among the populations.
   Different adaptive histories are further hypothesized to have
   contributed to these population differences. Here, we genotyped 98
   polymorphisms of the complete DRD4 gene including the flanking regions
   for 595 individuals of the four populations. We show that the LD
   structure, specifically around the original exon 3 SNP is conserved
   across the four populations and does not explain the heterogeneous
   association results. Study-wide significant associations with
   exploratory behaviour were detected in more than one haplotype block
   around exon 2, 3 and 4 in two of the four tested populations with
   different allele effect models. This indicates genetic heterogeneity in
   the association between multiple DRD4 polymorphisms and exploratory
   behaviour across populations. The association signals were in or close
   to regions with signatures of positive selection. We therefore
   hypothesize that variation in exploratory and other dopamine-related
   behaviour evolves locally by occasional adaptive shifts in the frequency
   of underlying genetic variants.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of animal personality attribute personality to genetic
   traits. But a recent study by Magnhagen and Staffan (Behav Ecol
   Sociobiol 57:295-303, 2005) on young perch in small groups showed that
   boldness, a central personality trait, is also shaped by social
   interactions and by previous experience. The authors measured boldness
   by recording the duration that an individual spent near a predator and
   the speed with which it fed there. They found that duration near the
   predator increased over time and was higher the higher the average
   boldness of other group members. In addition, the feeding rate of shy
   individuals was reduced if other members of the same group were bold.
   The authors supposed that these behavioral dynamics were caused by
   genetic differences, social interactions, and habituation to the
   predator. However, they did not quantify exactly how this could happen.
   In the present study, we therefore use an agent-based model to
   investigate whether these three factors may explain the empirical
   findings. We choose an agent-based model because this type of model is
   especially suited to study the relation between behavior at an
   individual level and behavioral dynamics at a group level. In our model,
   individuals were either hiding in vegetation or feeding near a predator,
   whereby their behavior was affected by habituation and by two social
   mechanisms: social facilitation to approach the predator and competition
   over food. We show that even if we start the model with identical
   individuals, these three mechanisms were sufficient to reproduce the
   behavioral dynamics of the empirical study, including the consistent
   differences among individuals. Moreover, if we start the model with
   individuals that already differ in boldness, the behavioral dynamics
   produced remained the same. Our results indicate the importance of
   previous experience and social interactions when studying animal
   personality empirically.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases
   when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in
   both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if
   particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate,
   skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We
   presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions,
   with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body
   condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to
   explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific,
   predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test
   sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions,
   yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition.
   Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in
   early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or
   females. While participation among males in high body condition was
   consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females,
   regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later,
   rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable
   behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that
   the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects
   entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely
   available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different
   personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that
   were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more
   likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in
   the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available
   meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to
   participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex,
   body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the
   testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or
   not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling
   biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in
   cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual
   differences in cognition difficult to interpret. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Behavioral traits and diet were traditionally thought to be highly
   plastic within individuals. This view was espoused in the widespread use
   of optimality models, which broadly predict that individuals can modify
   behavioral traits and diet across ecological contexts to maximize
   fitness. Yet, research conducted over the past 15 years supports an
   alternative view; fundamental behavioral traits (e.g., activity level,
   exploration, sociability, boldness and aggressiveness) and diet often
   vary among individuals and this variation persists over time and across
   contexts. This phenomenon has been termed animal personality with regard
   to behavioral traits and individual specialization with regard to diet.
   While these aspects of individual-level phenotypic variation have been
   thus far studied in isolation, emerging evidence suggests that
   personality and individual specialization may covary, or even be
   causally related. Building on this work, we present the overarching
   hypothesis that animal personality can drive specialization through
   individual differences in various aspects of consumer foraging behavior.
   Specifically, we suggest pathways by which consumer personality traits
   influence foraging activity, risk-dependent foraging, roles in social
   foraging groups, spatial aspects of foraging and physiological drivers
   of foraging, which in turn can lead to consistent individual differences
   in food resource use. These pathways provide a basis for generating
   testable hypotheses directly linking animal personality to ecological
   dynamics, a major goal in contemporary behavioral ecology.}},

Title = {{Applied personality assessment in domestic dogs: Limitations and caveats}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Modern behavioural tests for domestic dogs are commonly employed across
   a variety of fields, including the assessment of companion, assistance,
   working and sporting dogs. While there is increasing scientific
   attention on the development and evaluation of behavioural tests used to
   assess personality, a lack of robust assessment of the validity and
   reliability of many test protocols currently in use `on the ground' has
   led to the repeated questioning of their use by both the scientific
   community and the public. This is particularly prevalent within the
   welfare sector, where consequences for dogs that are identified as
   behaviourally unsuitable for rehoming are dire. Despite the large body
   of work dedicated to canine personality and behavioural test
   development, relatively few reported protocols have been demonstrated to
   accurately and reliably predict behavioural traits in dogs, according to
   accepted validation and reliability assessment protocols used by
   psychologists. Inconsistencies in the terminology used to describe
   behaviour, tests and canine personality are common within the literature
   pertaining to applied personality testing of dogs, making discussion of
   the usefulness of such tests within the applied environment difficult.
   Furthermore, highly relevant information gained from the fields of
   psychology and ethology, such as the limitations of behaviour-only
   scoring systems, the need to assess both temporal and contextual
   stability during personality testing, and the effects of arousal,
   impulsivity and affective state on behaviour, is seemingly overlooked by
   some test developers, resulting in array of test protocols that suffer
   from similar, predictable design limitations. This review discusses the
   most prominent considerations and limitations relevant to the assessment
   of personality through behavioural tests in domestic dogs, and suggests
   possible mechanisms through which these limitations may be investigated
   and addressed. In particular, it is recommended that the results of
   shelter-based behavioural test batteries are interpreted within the
   limitations of the context in which they are performed, and test
   developers consider other methods with which personality may be assessed
   within the shelter environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Resolving phenotype variation within a population in response to
   environmental perturbation is central to understanding biological
   adaptation. Relating meaningful adaptive changes at the level of the
   transcriptome requires the identification of processes that have a
   functional significance for the individual. This remains a major
   objective towards understanding the complex interactions between
   environmental demand and an individual's capacity to respond to such
   demands. The interpretation of such interactions and the significance of
   biological variation between individuals from the same or different
   populations remain a difficult and under-addressed question. Here, we
   provide evidence that variation in gene expression between individuals
   in a zebrafish population can be partially resolved by a priori
   screening for animal personality and accounts for >9\% of observed
   variation in the brain transcriptome. Proactive and reactive individuals
   within a wild-type population exhibit consistent behavioural responses
   over time and context that relates to underlying differences in
   regulated gene networks and predicted protein-protein interactions.
   These differences can be mapped to distinct regions of the brain and
   provide a foundation towards understanding the coordination of
   underpinning adaptive molecular events within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Although there has been an increase in fend personality research, much
   more work is needed, with only 20 published studies, 17 of which focused
   on the domestic cat. Most studies show important implications for this
   type of research, but there is no consensus on terminology, method, or
   conclusions for felids, even at the species level. Felid personality
   research comes from various fields, and is often carried out with
   different methods, with diverse goals. This review evaluates the
   published research on felid personality, and addresses its reliability
   and validity. Only 60\% of the studies reported reliability estimates,
   and these varied greatly across personality dimensions. The sample
   weighted mean correlation of the reliability estimates was 0.68 (based
   on three studies). Fifty-five percent of the studies assessed validity.
   The personality dimensions with the highest validity for all species
   were Sociable, Dominant, and Curious, with a mean correlation of 0.82.
   Recommendations for future research and implications for aiding in
   conservation and captive animal management efforts and improving health
   and well-being and welfare are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The animal personality literature uses three approaches to assess
   personality. However, two of these methods, personality ratings and
   experimentation, have been little compared in captivity and never
   compared in the wild. We assessed the boldness of wild chacma baboons
   Papio ursinus using both ratings and experimental methods. Boldness was
   experimentally assessed when individuals were presented with a novel
   food item during natural foraging. The boldness of the same individuals
   was rated on a five-point scale by experienced observers. The ratings
   and experimental assessments of boldness were found to correlate
   positively and in a linear fashion. When considered categorically the
   two approaches showed variable agreement depending on the number of
   categories assigned and the cutoff criteria adopted. We suggest that the
   variation between approaches arises because each method captures
   different aspects of personality; ratings consider personality in
   absolute terms (using predefined criteria) and multiple contexts, while
   experimental assessments consider personality in relative terms (using
   experimental scores relative to the population average) and in limited
   contexts. We encourage animal personality researchers to consider
   adopting both methodologies in future studies. We also propose that
   future studies restrict their analyses to continuous data, since the
   greatest comparability between methods was found with these data.
   However, if individuals must be categorised, we suggest that researchers
   either (a) analyse only those individuals categorised as bold or shy by
   both ratings and experimental approaches or, if these methods cannot be
   employed simultaneously, (b) do not use approach-specific criteria but
   choose a cut-off that can be compared by both approaches.}},

Title = {{Paceless life? A meta-analysis of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts that individual
   differences in behavior should integrate with morphological,
   physiological, and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. For example, individuals with a ``slow{''} pace-of-life are
   expected to exhibit a slower growth rate, delayed reproduction, longer
   lifespans, have stronger immune responses, and are expected to avoid
   risky situations relative to ``fast{''} individuals. If supported, this
   hypothesis would help resolve ecological and evolutionary questions
   regarding the origin and maintenance of phenotypic variation. Support
   for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has, however, been mixed. Here,
   we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 articles and 179 estimates testing
   the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis as it applies to the integration of
   behaviors with physiological or life-history traits. We found little
   overall support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis with the mean
   support estimated as r = 0.06. Support for the pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis was significantly higher in invertebrates (r = 0.23) than
   vertebrates (r = 0.02) and significantly higher when based on phenotypic
   (r = 0.10) versus genetic correlations (r = -0.09). We also found that
   females exhibited correlations between behavior and life-history and
   physiology that were opposite the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis (r = -0.16) and that these correlations
   significantly differed from those observed in males (r = 0.01) or males
   and females pooled (r = 0.12). It was also the case that there was
   little support for the hypothesis when life-history and physiological
   traits were independently analyzed (behavior x life-history: r = 0.12;
   behavior x physiology: r = 0.04). Exploratory post hoc analyses revealed
   that correlations of behavior with growth rate and hormone levels were
   more likely to show support for the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis. The lack of overall support found in our analyses
   suggests that general assertions regarding phenotypic integration due to
   ``pace-of-life{''} should be re-evaluated.
   Significance statement
   The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has been proposed as an overall
   organizational framework for the integration of behavioral,
   life-history, and physiological traits. This hypothesis provides
   potentially profound insights into how and why phenotypic traits might
   covary and why phenotypic variation may be maintained within
   populations. Over the last 7 years, this organizational framework has
   been intensively investigated as it pertains to relationships between
   behavior and other traits. Here, we conducted an overall analysis of
   whether the hypothesis was supported. Despite considerable research
   investment across behavioral ecology, we did not find that available
   data supported the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. This suggests that
   either the hypothesis has been inappropriately tested or is not
   generally applicable.}},

Abstract = {{The field of animal personalities claims to fill a gap in our
   understanding of animal behavior, because it explicitly studies the
   adaptive significance of behavioral differences. This is a controversial
   claim given that the field of behavioral ecology firmly places the study
   of animal behavior in an evolutionary context. In fact, it is the
   evolutionary context that differentiates behavioral ecology from
   ethology and animal behavior, 2 fields that were already concerned with
   the study of behavior in nonhuman animals. So, if behavioral ecology
   already takes an evolutionary approach to variation in behavior, we ask
   what is personality research about exactly? This question is
   particularly pertinent now the focus of personality research shifts and
   the field moves away from being mainly descriptive to include
   quantitative frameworks. As a result, the field has come to borrow
   heavily from already established fields. In our view, this has resulted
   in ``animal personality{''} studies becoming nothing more than a
   rebranding of existing fields of research-fields that are far more
   solidly grounded and hypothesis driven than the often vague and
   superficial focus on animal personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation is central to our understanding of evolution and
   population ecology, yet its consequences for community ecology are
   poorly understood. Animal personality - consistent individual
   differences in suites of behaviours - may be particularly important for
   trophic dynamics, where predator personality can determine activity
   rates and patterns of attack. We used mesocosms with aquatic food webs
   in which the top predator (dragonfly nymphs) varied in activity and
   subsequent attack rates on zooplankton, and tested the effects of
   predator personality. We found support for four hypotheses: (1) active
   predators disproportionately reduce the abundance of prey, (2) active
   predators select for predator-resistant prey species, (3) active
   predators strengthen trophic cascades (increase phytoplankton abundance)
   and (4) active predators are more likely to cannibalise one another,
   weakening all other trends when at high densities. These results suggest
   that intraspecific variation in predator personality is an important
   determinant of prey abundance, community composition and trophic
   cascades.}},

Title = {{Mismatched partners that achieve postpairing behavioral similarity
   improve their reproductive success}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral similarity between partners is likely to promote within-pair
   compatibility and to result in better reproductive success. Therefore,
   individuals are expected to choose a partner that is alike in behavioral
   type. However, mate searching is very costly and does not guarantee
   finding a matching partner. If mismatched individuals pair, they may
   benefit from increasing their similarity after pairing. We show in a
   monogamous fish species-the convict cichlid-that the behavioral
   similarity between mismatched partners can increase after pairing. This
   increase resulted from asymmetrical adjustment because only the reactive
   individual became more alike its proactive partner, whereas the latter
   did not change its behavior. The mismatched pairs that increased their
   similarity not only improved their reproductive success but also raised
   it up to the level of matched pairs. While most studies assume that
   assortative mating results from mate choice, our study suggests that
   postpairing adjustment could be an alternative explanation for the high
   behavioral similarity between partners observed in the field. It also
   explains why interindividual behavioral differences can be maintained
   within a given population.}},

Title = {{Animal personality in a foundation species drives community divergence

Abstract = {{Despite thousands of papers on the topic, precious few of the studies on
   animal personality have considered the role of personality in shaping
   community-level processes. Here, we test the effect of individual
   variation on the long-term trajectories of biological communities, from
   initiation to their demise. The spider Anelosimus studiosus builds webs
   that serve as habitat for >50 species of spider, which together
   construct a species-rich silken reef. This species also exhibits a
   temporally consistent behavioural polymorphism where females exhibit
   either an aggressive or docile phenotype (personality). In this study,
   we established incipient colonies of either two docile or two aggressive
   females and then tracked community succession and persistence over
   7years in the field. In particular, we noted the community compositions
   associated with colony extinction/collapse events, which are common in
   this species. The community composition of webs founded by different
   phenotypes diverged rapidly in their early successional stages. However,
   this period of divergence was ephemeral and all communities eventually
   converged on a similar composition; communities founded by aggressive
   females merely took longer to reach it. This secondary stage of
   community convergence was itself short-lived and independent of
   founders' personality; all communities collapsed within a year of
   achieving it. Experimentally imposing this fatal climax composition on
   colonies caused 80\% of communities to collapse within a year,
   suggesting that this climax composition actually causes the collapse of
   the community. Community collapse was characterized by a complete
   die-off of the foundation species and the dispersal of all other
   spiders. Thus, the behavioural traits of the founding, foundational
   individuals of these communities dictate their path of succession and
   longevity in the wild.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{A crucial assumption of animal personality research is that behaviour is
   consistent over time, showing a high repeatability within individuals.
   This assumption is often made, sometimes tested using short time
   intervals between behavioural tests, but rarely thoroughly investigated
   across long time intervals crossing different stages of ontogeny. We
   performed such a longitudinal test across three life stages in zebra
   finches (Taeniopygia guttata), representing about 15-20\% of their life
   span in captivity, and found repeatabilities ranging from 0.03 to 0.67.
   Fearlessness and exploration were the most repeatable traits both within
   and across life stages. Activity and aggression were repeatable across,
   but not or only partly within life stages. Boldness was not repeatable.
   Furthermore, we found no evidence for a consistent behavioural syndrome
   structure across ontogeny. Our results indicate that the consistency of
   behavioural traits and their correlations might be overestimated and
   suggest that life-long stability of animal personality should not simply
   be assumed.}},

Abstract = {{The study of adaptive individual behavior ({''}animal personality{''})
   focuses on whether individuals differ consistently in (suites of
   correlated) behavior(s) and whether individual-level behavior is under
   selection. Evidence for selection acting on personality is biased toward
   species where behavioral and life-history information can readily be
   collected in the wild, such as ungulates and passerine birds. Here, we
   report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors
   that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the
   wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related
   survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase
   where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As
   proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow,
   flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all
   behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome
   structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily
   survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily
   observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat
   repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed.
   Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of
   repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays
   were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which
   could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected
   behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish
   individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence
   for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance. Our
   findings, therefore, forcefully demonstrate that personality variation
   exists in wild insects and that it is associated with components of
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The role of anthropogenic sources in generating, maintaining, and
   influencing behavioral syndromes has recently been identified as an
   important area of future research. Endocrine disrupting chemicals are
   prevalent and persistent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. These
   chemicals are known to have marked effects on the morphology and
   behavior of exposed individuals and, as such, may serve as a potential
   influence on behavioral syndromes. However, both the effects of exposure
   on behaviors beyond courtship and aggression and how exposure might
   affect behavioral variation at the individual level are understudied. To
   address this question, we examined boldness behavior in female Siamese
   fighting fish in three different assays (Novel Environment, Empty Tank,
   Shoaling) both before and after they were exposed to the estrogen mimic,
   17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). EE2 influences courtship, aggression,
   and boldness in males of this species but its effects have not been
   examined in females, to our knowledge. Females were tested multiple
   times in each assay before and after exposure so that behavioral
   consistency could be examined. A behavioral syndrome for boldness and
   activity level occurred across the three assays. The reductions in
   boldness and loss of the behavioral syndrome that resulted from EE2
   exposure were surprising and suggest that the effects of EE2 exposure on
   female behavior and physiology should be examined more frequently. This
   study is one of the first to examine the effects of EE2 in females as
   well as on correlated behaviors and emphasizes the importance of
   examining the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals on individual
   behavioral variation and consistency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Individuals in social species commonly form dominance relationships,
   where dominant individuals enjoy greater access to resources compared to
   subordinates. A range of factors such as sex, age, body size and prior
   experiences has to varying degrees been observed to affect the social
   status an individual obtains. Recent work on animal personality (i.e.
   consistent variation in behavioural responses of individuals)
   demonstrates that personality can co-vary with social status, suggesting
   that also behavioural variation can play an important role in
   establishment of status. We investigated whether personality could
   predict the outcome of duels between pairs of morphologically matched
   male domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a species where
   individuals readily form social hierarchies. We found that males that
   more quickly explored a novel arena, or remained vigilant for a longer
   period following the playback of a warning call were more likely to
   obtain a dominant position. These traits were uncorrelated to each other
   and were also uncorrelated to aggression during the initial part of the
   dominance-determining duel. Our results indicate that several
   behavioural traits independently play a role in the establishment of
   social status, which in turn can have implications for the reproductive
   success of different personality types.}},

Abstract = {{While the ecological impacts of invasive species have been demonstrated
   for many taxonomic groups, the potential effects of behavioural
   variation among non-native individuals (i.e. personality) on these
   impacts have been largely overlooked. This is despite the fact that
   recent studies have demonstrated that, by nature, the three first stages
   of biological invasions (i.e. transport, establishment and spread) can
   lead to personality-biased populations. Freshwater ecosystems provide a
   unique opportunity to investigate this issue, notably because the
   ecological impacts of non-native species have been extensively
   documented and because animal personality has been widely studied using
   freshwater model species. Here, we aim at developing some perspectives
   on the potential effects of animal personality on the ecological impacts
   of freshwater non-native species across levels of biological
   organizations. At the individual level, personality types have been
   demonstrated to affect the physiology, metabolism, life history traits
   and fitness of individuals. We used these effects to discuss how they
   could subsequently impact invaded populations and, in turn, recipient
   communities. We also discussed how these might translate into changes in
   the structure of food webs and the functioning of invaded ecosystems.
   Finally we discussed how these perspectives could interact with the
   management of invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic noise can have serious implications for animals,
   especially when they communicate acoustically. Yet, the impacts of noise
   may depend not only on noise characteristics but also on an individual's
   coping style or personality. We tested whether noise is more disturbing
   if it masks communication signals, and whether characteristics of both
   the noise and the individual affect its impact. Using a unique
   population of personality-typed great tits, Parus major, we tested
   whether the kind of noise and parental personality affect parental
   nestbox visits and nestling begging. Nestboxes were exposed to automated
   noise playbacks, differing in spectral composition (noise masking
   begging calls, nonmasking noise or no noise). Parental nestbox visits
   were recorded using RFID transponders. Video and audio recordings were
   used to quantify nestling begging. Nestlings mainly begged in silence
   and in the presence of parents. Parents reduced nestbox visits during
   noise treatments regardless of the kind of noise and initially reacted
   more strongly to nonmasking noise. Moreover, slower explorers took
   longer to enter the nestbox during noise than faster explorers. Total
   visit rates during noise depended on parental sex and personality. In
   females, bolder individuals, but in males shyer individuals, reduced
   total visits during noise. These results extend previous findings in
   showing experimentally that the disturbance effects of noise do not
   depend on whether or not the noise directly interferes with information
   exchange by masking signals. Moreover, personality- and sex-specific
   responses to noise indicate that anthropogenic disturbance can
   differentially affect individuals within populations, which will
   influence mitigation strategies. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Individual behavioural differences, consistent over time and/or across
   situations, have been included under the term of personality. These
   behavioural differences have been shown to affect a variety of major
   ecological traits, all of which have a strong effect on the fitness of
   the individual. However, the personality of an individual could also
   have a strong influence on the decisions of other individuals, in
   situations such as selecting or avoiding a social companion or a mate.
   Under this scenario, indicators of different personalities would have
   evolved, but the possible signalling of personality has received little
   consideration to date. We hypothesized that birds can signal their
   personality through feather coloration and tested this hypothesis in
   siskins relating different colour patches to their exploration score. To
   measure exploration, we presented the siskins with a novel object and
   calculated how long they took to approach it. We found that siskins with
   larger black bibs showed shorter approach latencies. This finding
   supports the idea that plumage coloration traits can provide information
   about personality traits of the bearer. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are assumed to be present when there are consistent
   between-individual differences in behaviour, whereas behavioural
   flexibility occurs when individual responses are continuously adjusted.
   Where both possibilities have been tested for, individuals may show both
   behavioural consistency and flexibility. Therefore, to gauge the
   importance of consistent individual differences in behaviour, it is
   useful to compare the strength of consistency with that of plasticity in
   behaviour. Here we investigate startle responses in hermit crabs
   (Pagurus bernhardus (L., 1758)) in high- and low-risk situations. We
   vary the level of risk between situations by manipulating the quality of
   empty gastropod shells available to the crabs. Comparison of statistical
   effect size estimates for tests of concordance and difference between
   situations reveals a strong pattern of consistent between-individual
   differences in behaviour in comparison to a statistically significant
   but reactively weak pattern of behavioural flexibility. Although the
   startle duration varied, on average, in crabs from different sites, this
   was mainly due to different responses during an in situ phase of the
   experiment.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{962-970}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Consistent behavioural differences between individuals have far-reaching
   implications for ecology and evolution, including how populations cope
   with increasing anthropogenic changes, notably pesticides. Although
   sublethal doses of insecticides are known to alter behaviour, current
   studies on the relationship between toxicants and behaviour tend to
   ignore effects on individual variation. Our objective was to determine
   whether sublethal exposure to an organophosphate insecticide could
   affect the consistency of individual behaviour and disrupt behavioural
   correlations, in a jumping spider occurring in agroecosystems. Adults of
   the jumping spider Eris militaris (Araneae: Salticidae) were scored by
   an open-field and a prey-capture assay, each conducted pre- and post-
   exposure to the organophosphate insecticide phosmet. Half of the
   individuals received no exposure to the insecticide to provide a control
   group. We then estimated the changes in repeatability, a measure of the
   extent of personality differences, and in behavioural correlations
   between control and insecticide-treated groups. Although insecticide
   exposure had no discernable effects on the population's average
   behaviours, insecticide-exposed individuals showed an average of 23\%
   lower repeatability and the correlation between activity and prey
   capture was more strongly collapsed in females. Our results provide
   clear evidence that exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides on an
   important arthropod predator in agroecosystems causes substantial
   alteration of personality differences even in absence of a
   population-wide shift in behaviour. This suggests that insecticide
   effects are more complex than previously thought and indicates high
   variation in the way individuals coped with insecticidal exposure. By
   altering the consistency of behavioural traits and their correlations,
   exposure to sublethal concentrations of insecticides can have subtle
   effects on behavioural expression, which may ultimately affect
   biocontrol performance in an important arthropod predator in
   agroecosystems. Our study calls for an increasing focus on individual
   behavioural variation when testing the effects of pesticides on
   non-targeted fauna.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{543-556}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natal dispersal, the movement of an organism from its birthplace to the
   site of first reproduction, is fundamental to many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. Mechanistically, individual dispersal decisions
   can depend on both individual phenotype and environmental cues. In
   particular, many established evolutionary theories of dispersal
   highlight the importance of the social environment. More recent research
   in behavioral ecology has focused on the importance of individual
   behavioral phenotypes. We reviewed the literature on individual
   behavioral phenotypes and dispersal and suggest that how individual
   behavioral phenotypes interact with the immediate social environment
   experienced by individuals in influencing dispersal is still poorly
   understood, despite growing interest. We found that very few studies had
   examined the interaction of individual behavioral phenotypes and social
   factors, and behavioral phenotypes related to social tendencies were
   less commonly measured than were behavioral phenotypes related to
   exploration or response to risk. Further, and unsurprisingly, studies on
   social behavioral phenotypes and dispersal behaviors during the
   transience stage of dispersal were underrepresented compared to the
   departure or settlement stages. Future studies in this area should aim
   to: a) make explicit links between behavioral traits and their proposed
   effects on dispersal decisions throughout multiple stages of dispersal,
   b) integrate more continuous dispersal variables, and c) consider the
   effects of the spatial distribution and phenotypes of conspecifics
   (i.e., the social landscape) encountered by individual dispersers.}},

   enlarged) and evaluated whether individuals of dissimilar coping style
   differed in their level of optimization. If reactive females behaved
   optimally, any deviation from their original brood size should lower
   fitness, whereas this should not be the case for proactive females.
   Reactive females indeed performed best at their natural brood size,
   whereas proactive females performed best when raising an enlarged brood.
   These findings imply that proactive females produced sub-optimal brood
   sizes. We speculate that proactive females might (i) take decisions
   based on biased perception of their environment, (ii) face energetic
   constraints in offspring production and/or (iii) be more willing to
   invest into current reproduction when given the option. Our findings
   provide experimental evidence for coping style-related differences in
   optimal reproductive decisions and life-history strategies.}},

Title = {{Reliability and validity of a questionnaire survey in canine anxiety
   research}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{82-92}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Canine behavior can be assessed through behavioral testing or
   questionnaire surveys. Behavioral tests, often observed by independent
   experts, can provide objective data, but capture only a short behavioral
   sequence in a defined situation and are practical only for small study
   cohorts. Questionnaires can be targeted to much larger populations and
   provide long-term perspectives on behaviors, including potential
   correlated environmental factors. However, questionnaires are sensitive
   for misinterpretations and the subjectivity of the participant may
   affect the outcome. Therefore, particular attention has to be paid to
   structure and form of the questions to ensure that the questionnaire
   measures what it is supposed to measure. We have initiated a program on
   genetic studies in canine anxiety and have developed a questionnaire for
   behavioral phenotyping. The aim of the questionnaire is to identify the
   most fearful dogs (cases) and dogs not showing fear (controls) within
   and across breeds for gene mapping purposes. Knowing the challenges in
   the phenotyping of complex neurobehavioral traits, the aim of this study
   was to assess the external and convergent validity and re-test
   reliability of the developed questionnaire. External validity was
   assessed by comparing questionnaire data against short behavioral test
   of selected dogs (N=54), and convergent validity was estimated using
   ``known group comparisons{''}, i.e. whether the dogs with separation
   anxiety have also more noise phobia. Re-test reliability was evaluated
   from the subsample (N=36) of the owners who filled the questionnaire
   twice within an 8-month period. We found an excellent correlation
   between questionnaire data and the behavioral test, and the most
   important questions on the fearful reactions toward strangers, had the
   highest correlation with the behavioral test in which the dog met a
   stranger (mean r(s) = 0.63). Convergent validity was also well
   demonstrated by showing that a known co-morbid anxiety trait, separation
   anxiety, was more common in noise sensitive dogs as expected (Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test chi(2)(1.1732) = 9.8, p < 0.01). Similarly, the
   test-retest reliability was good (mean values: 0.69 Spearman
   correlation; 0.59 Kappa value). Most importantly, the questions asking
   the frequency of fear reactions had excellent repeatability (mean
   frequency of fear reactions toward humans, dogs and situations 0.78
   Spearman correlation, toward thunder, gunshot, fireworks, 0.76 Spearman
   correlation). These results encourage a conclusion that our
   questionnaire may serve as a reliable phenotyping tool for fearfulness
   in dogs, which, in turn, should help us to establish sufficiently large
   study cohorts for successful genetic analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   Order and Individual Traits in Dogs}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Movement interactions and the underlying social structure in groups have
   relevance across many social-living species. Collective motion of groups
   could be based on an ``egalitarian'' decision system, but in practice it
   is often influenced by underlying social network structures and by
   individual characteristics. We investigated whether dominance rank and
   personality traits are linked to leader and follower roles during joint
   motion of family dogs. We obtained high-resolution spatio-temporal GPS
   trajectory data (823,148 data points) from six dogs belonging to the
   same household and their owner during 14 30-40 min unleashed walks. We
   identified several features of the dogs' paths (e. g., running speed or
   distance from the owner) which are characteristic of a given dog. A
   directional correlation analysis quantifies interactions between pairs
   of dogs that run loops jointly. We found that dogs play the role of the
   leader about 50-85\% of the time, i.e. the leader and follower roles in
   a given pair are dynamically interchangable. However, on a longer
   timescale tendencies to lead differ consistently. The network
   constructed from these loose leader-follower relations is hierarchical,
   and the dogs' positions in the network correlates with the age,
   dominance rank, trainability, controllability, and aggression measures
   derived from personality questionnaires. We demonstrated the possibility
   of determining dominance rank and personality traits of an individual
   based only on its logged movement data. The collective motion of dogs is
   influenced by underlying social network structures and by
   characteristics such as personality differences. Our findings could pave
   the way for automated animal personality and human social interaction
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in behavioral responses to environmental conditions and
   biological interactions are a key determinant of individual performance.
   This study investigated how the availability and predictability of food
   resources modulates the growth of animals that adopt different
   behavioral strategies. Results show that, irrespective of the feeding
   regime, the growth of juvenile brown trout increased with the expression
   of active foraging behavior and, similarly, with increasing use of
   shelter. Conversely, territorial aggressive behavior only promoted
   growth when food resources Were spatially and temporally predictable,
   and only for individuals that had high metabolic rates (when compared
   with their low metabolic rate siblings). Thus, this study shows that
   only certain behaviors are associated with variation in the physiology
   of individuals. Moreover, only certain behaviors associate differently
   with growth under different environmental conditions. These results are
   partially consistent with the hypothesis that environmental variability
   promotes the coexistence of alternative behavioral phenotypes. However,
   some behaviors enhanced growth irrespective of feeding regime, and we
   did not identify a set of conditions where fish with low resting
   metabolic rate (RMR) outperformed their high RMR siblings. Hence,
   additional layers of environmental variation are likely to be required
   for individuals with low RMR to show maximal growth performance.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of individual differences on the behaviour and reproduction
   of zoo animals has long been recognised by zoo biologists, yet only
   recently has the quantitative assessment of personality been used to
   investigate some of the challenges faced in zoo animal management. We
   review the findings of animal personality studies carried out in zoos
   since 1995. Our results reveal that zoo animal personality is most
   commonly assessed using observer ratings, where people who are familiar
   with the animals are asked to rate them on various personality traits.
   The reviewed studies indicate that zoo keepers are able to reliably rate
   animal personality traits, and these ratings are valid and related to
   behaviour. We identify promising areas of development in zoo animal
   personality research and suggest applications of personality profiling
   to zoo animal welfare and management. We argue that a validated
   personality questionnaire is a valuable tool for zoo professionals and
   advocate the implementation of personality assessment into existing zoo
   management practices to inform decisions on welfare and captive

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is often assumed to be the most flexible of traits, yet
   recent studies show a high repeatability of behaviour within individuals
   even across different functional contexts. Such consistent expression of
   behaviour may evolve either when selection favours its integration with
   less flexible components of the phenotype or when pleiotropic effects
   produce correlations between behaviours that have different optimal
   timing of expression. Examining the physiological mechanisms underlying
   correlated expression of behaviours provides powerful insight into the
   evolution of personalities by establishing the extent to which
   pleiotropic effects might limit the independent evolution of distinct
   behaviours. 2. Here, we investigated proximate mechanisms behind
   aggressive and non-aggressive personality types in western bluebirds,
   Sialia mexicana, to determine whether consistency in the expression of
   aggression is because of shared effects of plasma-circulating androgens
   on aggression and mating behaviour. 3. We found that androgen
   concentration was unrelated to variation in both intra- and
   interspecific aggression even though it was closely linked to variation
   in male mating behaviour. These results suggest that pleiotropic effects
   of circulating androgens are unlikely to cause consistent differences
   among individuals in aggression. 4. These findings suggest that
   decoupling of the activational effects of hormones on behaviour is an
   important step in the evolution of personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,
   potentially removing these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their key role as model organisms in many behavioral studies,
   crustacean decapods have been only slightly touched upon by the recent
   surge of scientific interest in animal personality. Only seven articles
   investigated the issue in a handful of species among hermit crabs,
   crabs, and crayfish. Obviously, a limited number of publications does
   not mean that personality is rare in decapods. On the contrary, few
   studies might be the result of a form of reluctance by behavioral
   ecologists to deal with such a phenomenon in these and other
   invertebrates. This reluctance contrasts with the enthusiasm shown in
   tackling the behavioral plasticity issue. Here we discuss the possible
   theoretical and methodological difficulties raised by applying the
   animal personality perspective to decapods and analyze implications of
   personality studies for their ecology, conservation, and welfare. By
   highlighting gaps in knowledge and directions of future research, our
   intention is to increase scientific emphasis on the issue {[}Current

Abstract = {{The main aims of this study were to investigate (1) the occurrence and
   strength of the shyness-boldness behavioural syndrome in brown trout
   fry, (2) whether this syndrome is associated with paternal migratory
   life history, (3) whether fry survival and growth in the wild is
   associated with paternal life history and/or boldness and (4) whether
   offspring performance showed maternal effects. Nine female migratory
   trout were each crossed with one migratory and one resident male and the
   offspring were raised in hatchery tanks until first feeding. The
   behavioural studies showed that fry that responded bold towards a novel
   object also accepted a novel food item earlier and responded more
   aggressively towards their own mirror image. Principal component
   analysis showed that this shyness-boldness syndrome (PC1) explained 34\%
   of the behavioural variation. Offspring boldness was not affected by
   paternal migratory life history, but significant effects of the female
   parent suggested maternal and/or genetic effects. Deviations from this
   pattern (PC2), where some individuals behaved less aggressively and
   performed more approaches to food, explained an additional 17\% of the
   variation in behaviour, and was significantly influenced by length and
   paternal migratory life history. Fry growth and survival in nature was
   not associated with boldness (PC1) or PC2, suggesting that alternative
   behavioural strategies can be successful in nature. However, female
   parent effects on variation in fry size persisted over the first growth
   period in the wild, suggesting that these effects may influence
   offspring fitness during early life when major selection occurs.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{787-796}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Consistent inter-individual variation in behaviour over time and across
   contexts has been reported for a wide variety of animals, a phenomenon
   commonly referred to as personality. As behavioural patterns develop
   inside families, rearing conditions could have lasting effects on the
   expression of adult personality. In species with parental care,
   conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and
   offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the
   interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness,
   exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside
   the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside
   families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to
   offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences.
   Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically
   observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and
   dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which
   may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings.
   However, there has been little research on how personality relates to
   parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on
   how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and
   offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{34-44}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Individually distinctive behavioral traits, or personalities, contribute
   to population-level processes and ecological interactions important in
   applied wildlife conservation research. Inter-individual variation in
   behavioral traits (personality) and correlation among behavioral traits
   (behavioral syndromes), can influence empirical estimates of population
   size and structure, models of resource selection and population
   dynamics, harvest and control in wildlife and fisheries populations,
   population response to disturbance and novel environments, and the
   success of reintroduction. Despite the important role that personality
   and behavioral syndromes play in the ecology and dynamics of wildlife
   populations, a disconnect between basic and applied research realms
   continues. While the concept of animal personalities and their role in
   ecology and evolution is increasingly embraced in the animal behavior,
   ecology, and evolutionary biology literature, it is less represented in
   applied wildlife management and conservation literature. We identify 10
   research foci, often considered the domain of applied wildlife
   management and conservation, summarize examples of how these research
   domains may be influenced by personality and behavioral syndromes, and
   outline potential implications. We suggest that a focus on individuals
   in wildlife conservation study can bridge the gap between basic and
   applied research and incorporate knowledge from both realms towards more
   effective management, conservation, and recovery of populations. (C)

Title = {{The contribution of developmental experience vs. condition to life

Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{915-926}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Developmental experience, for example food abundance during juvenile
   stages, is known to affect life history and behaviour. However, the life
   history and behavioural consequences of developmental experience have
   rarely been studied in concert. As a result, it is still unclear whether
   developmental experience affects behaviour through changes in life
   history, or independently of it. 2. The effect of developmental
   experience on life history and behaviour may also be masked or affected
   by individual condition during adulthood. Thus, it is critical to tease
   apart the effects of developmental experience and current individual
   condition on life history and behaviour. 3. In this study, we
   manipulated food abundance during development in the western black widow
   spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing spiders on either a restricted
   or ad lib diet. We separated developmental from condition-dependent
   effects by assaying adult foraging behaviour (tendency to attack prey
   and to stay on out of the refuge following an attack) and web structure
   multiple times under different levels of satiation following different
   developmental treatments. 4. Spiders reared under food restriction
   matured slower and at a smaller size than spiders reared in ad lib
   conditions. Spiders reared on a restricted diet were more aggressive
   towards prey and built webs structured for prey capture, while spiders
   reared on an ad lib diet were less aggressive and built safer webs.
   Developmental treatment affected which traits were plastic as adults:
   restricted spiders built safer webs when their adult condition
   increased, while ad lib spiders reduced their aggression when their
   adult condition increased. The amount of individual variation in
   behaviour and web structure varied with developmental treatment. Spiders
   reared on a restricted diet exhibited consistent variation in all
   aspects of foraging behaviour and web structure, while spiders reared on
   an ad lib diet exhibited consistent individual variation in aggression
   and web weight only. 5. Developmental experience affected the average
   life history, behaviour and web structure of spiders, but also shaped
   the amount of phenotypic variation observed among individuals.
   Surprisingly, developmental experience also determined the particular
   way in which individuals plastically adjusted their behaviour and web
   structure to changes in adult condition.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Some evidence documents the importance of personality
   assessments for health research and practise. However, no study has
   opted to test whether a short self-report personality inventory may
   comprehensively inform health policy.
   Methods: Data were taken from a population-based epidemiologic survey in
   Zurich, Switzerland, conducted from 2010-2012. A short form of the Big
   Five Inventory was completed by n = 1155 participants (54.4\% women;
   mean age = 29.6 years), while health-related outcomes were taken from a
   comprehensive semi-structured clinical interview. A convenience
   subsample averaging n = 171 participants additionally provided
   laboratory measures and n = 133 were subsequently followed-up at least
   once over a maximal period of 6 months.
   Results: Personality traits, in particular high neuroticism and low
   conscientiousness, related significantly to poor environmental resources
   such as low social support (R-2 = 0.071), health-impairing behaviours
   such as cannabis use (R-2 = 0.071), and psychopathology, including
   negative affect (R-2 = 0.269) and various mental disorders (R-2 =
   0.060-0.195). The proportion of total variance explained was R-2 = 0339
   in persons with three or more mental disorders. Personality
   significantly related to some laboratory measures including total
   cholesterol (R-2 = 0.095) and C-Reactive Protein (R-2 = 0.062). Finally,
   personality prospectively predicted global psychopathological distress
   and vegetative symptoms over a 6-month observation period.
   Conclusions: Personality relates consistently to poor
   socio-environmental resources, health-impairing behaviours and
   psychopathology. We also found some evidence for an association with
   metabolic and immune functions that are assumed to influence health. A
   short personality inventory could provide valuable information for
   preventive medicine when used as a means to screen entire populations
   for distinct risk exposure, in particular with respect to
   psychopathology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits are heritable and respond to natural selection, but
   are at the same time influenced by the ontogenetic environment.
   Epigenetic effects, such as DNA methylation, have been proposed as a key
   mechanism to control personality variation. However, to date little is
   known about the contribution of epigenetic effects to natural variation
   in behaviour. Here, we show that great tit (Parus major) lines
   artificially selected for divergent exploratory behaviour for four
   generations differ in their DNA methylation levels at the dopamine
   receptor D4 (DRD4) gene. This D4 receptor is statistically associated
   with personality traits in both humans and nonhuman animals, including
   the great tit. Previous work in this songbird failed to detect
   functional genetic polymorphisms within DRD4 that could account for the
   gene-trait association. However, our observation supports the idea that
   DRD4 is functionally involved in exploratory behaviour but that its
   effects are mediated by DNA methylation. While the exact mechanism
   underlying the transgenerational consistency of DRD4 methylation remains
   to be elucidated, this study shows that epigenetic mechanisms are
   involved in shaping natural variation in personality traits. We outline
   how this first finding provides a basis for investigating the epigenetic
   contribution to personality traits in natural systems and its subsequent
   role for understanding the ecology and evolution of behavioural
   consistency.}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences
   in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological,
   metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in
   part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the
   phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental
   sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the
   hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory
   propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta
   domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field
   behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether
   among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour
   and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable,
   but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits.
   Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits
   covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate.
   Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory
   propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary
   change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which
   selection can act more rapidly. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{We examine the causes of variation in personality traits among human
   hunter-horticulturalists. Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial
   aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious
   cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the
   possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the
   heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the
   heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest
   personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's
   phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality
   origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but
   pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short
   supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among
   Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of
   cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human
   prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial
   personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in
   ``embodied capital{''}aEuro{''}that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic
   traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this
   hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital-physical strength and
   formal education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial
   leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing
   gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership.
   Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength
   and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO,
   which suggests that prosocial traits may be ``reactively heritable{''}
   by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of
   embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in
   future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations
   of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society
   and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to
   elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of dispersal is important as it strongly
   influences population dynamics and evolution. However, context
   dependency of dispersal decisions, such as effects of social
   interactions and resource availability, is rarely disentangled from
   intrinsic factors, such as animal personality. Western bluebirds provide
   a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of intrinsic
   versus extrinsic factors in dispersal decisions because they display
   distinct aggressive personality types, have high recruitment of sons to
   the natal population, and depend on nest cavities, a resource that is
   easy to quantify. Here, we measured territorial interactions among kin
   and non-kin, resource availability, and aggressive behavior over an
   11-year period to determine how they influenced dispersal decisions of
   male offspring. We found that distance dispersed from kin was driven by
   a male's own aggression, the aggression of his nearest kin, and the
   resources available on the natal territory. Both aggressive males and
   males with aggressive kin dispersed longer distances, as did males who
   had fewer resources on their natal territories. Thus, dispersal in this
   species is influenced jointly by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   Because resource acquisition and personality type are interdependent in
   this species, changes in the social environment are likely to have
   important consequences for population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{It has often been argued that the spectacular cognitive capacities of
   humans are the result of selection for the ability to gather, process,
   and use information about other people. Recent studies show that humans
   strongly and consistently differ in what type of social information they
   are interested in. Although some individuals mainly attend to what the
   majority is doing (frequency-based learning), others focus on the
   success that their peers achieve with their behavior (success-based
   learning). Here, we show that such differences in social learning have
   important consequences for the outcome of social interactions. We report
   on a decision-making experiment in which individuals were first
   classified as frequency- and success-based learners and subsequently
   grouped according to their learning strategy. When confronted with a
   social dilemma situation, groups of frequency-based learners cooperated
   considerably more than groups of success-based learners. A detailed
   analysis of the decision-making process reveals that these differences
   in cooperation are a direct result of the differences in information
   use. Our results show that individual differences in social learning
   strategies are crucial for understanding social behavior.}},

   been documented in a wide range of taxa. Although traditionally
   considered noise around an average, other potentially adaptive sources
   of phenotypic variation exist. IDs in behavior that are consistent
   across time and context are more recently recognized as expressions of
   underlying personality traits, which may even be heritable.
   Unfortunately, despite the rapid advances that have been made in animal
   personality research utilizing fish the last decade, a few have detailed
   the groundwork necessary to document consistency in behavior across time
   and context. This foundation is required, by definition, before one can
   draw conclusions about personality traits. Here, we examine whether IDs
   in behavior are consistent over time and across contexts and explore the
   construct validity of six commonly used behavioral assays for examining
   four personality traits: aggression, boldness, fear, and exploration.
   Thirty zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed twice each to a small open
   field, large open field, mirror, emergence, novel object, and predator
   response test. Results revealed consistency in most behavioral measures
   across both time and context. There was mixed evidence for the construct
   validity of these assays in capturing the targeted personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in how individuals invest in acquiring information (sampling)
   and in insuring themselves against potential negative consequences of
   uncertainty (e.g., by storing energy reserves) has been suggested to
   underlie consistent individual differences in suites of behavioral
   traits. However, the key drivers of individual differences in
   information use remain poorly understood. We use dynamic programming to
   explore how existing variation in metabolic rates (MRs) affects the use
   of sampling and insurance under starvation risk. Our analysis reveals
   nonlinear effects of MRs on diurnal patterns of sampling and insurance.
   Individuals with low MRs accrue reserves quickly, because they invest in
   sampling and are able to exploit profitable options when they arise.
   Individuals with intermediate MRs initially lose reserves, because
   sampling, while optimal, is relatively expensive; however, they later
   build reserves due to efficient exploitation of alternative foraging
   options. Sampling rarely pays for individuals with the highest MRs,
   which show relatively constant levels of energy reserves throughout the
   foraging period. Thus, individual variation in MRs on the scale observed
   in natural populations can lead to important differences in investment
   in sampling and insurance and may underpin consistent individual
   differences in suites of other behavioral traits, including individual
   differences in behavioral responsiveness.}},

Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities, i.e. consistent differences in behavior across
   time and/or context, have received increased attention of behavioral
   biologists over the last years. Recent research shows that personalities
   represent traits on which natural and sexual selection work and which
   can have substantial fitness consequences. The aim of this study is to
   establish the personality structure of crested macaque (Macaca nigra)
   males as foundation for future studies on its adaptive value. We
   collected behavioral data through focal animal sampling and additionally
   conducted two sets of playback experiments. Results of a factor analysis
   on the behavioral data revealed a four factor structure with components
   we labeled Anxiety, Sociability, Connectedness and Aggressiveness.
   Results from the experiments revealed an additional and independent
   Boldness factor but the absence of Neophilia. Overall, this structure
   resembles other macaque and animal species with the exception of
   Connectedness, which might be a consequence of the species' tolerant
   social style. Our results thus not only form the basis for future
   studies on the adaptive value of personality in crested macaques but
   also contribute an important data point for investigating the evolution
   of personality structure from a comparative perspective by refining, for
   example, which personality factors characterized the last common
   ancestor of hominids and macaques.}},

Abstract = {{The energetic definition of fitness predicts that natural selection will
   maximize the residual energy available for growth and reproduction
   suggesting that energy metabolism might be a target of selection. In
   this experimental study, we investigated whether female and male yellow
   mealworm beetles, Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae),
   differ in their hiding behaviour, individual response latency time, and
   duration of immobility to treatments mimicking an approaching predation
   threat. We experimentally tested whether consistently repeatable
   anti-predatory responses and resting metabolic rates (RMR) correlated
   with survival rates of individuals exposed to a nocturnal predator, the
   brown rat, Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) (Rodentia: Muridae). Resting
   metabolic rate was part of a syndrome involving anti-predator behaviour.
   Individuals with lower RMR concealed themselves against predators in
   substrate more successfully than individuals with higher RMR, and hiding
   was associated with longer periods of immobility. Ultimately, mortality
   was higher in the high-RMR beetles compared to the low-RMR beetles. Our
   results provide direct evidence of natural selection against mobility,
   i.e., for reduced RMR in T.molitor beetles.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the
   life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to
   travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in
   dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g.
   specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar
   reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive
   abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl
   is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many
   physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress
   response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is
   also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site
   to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one
   breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set.
   Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during
   natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering
   experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents
   had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by
   parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and
   breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating
   that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled
   in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might
   be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to
   explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration
   and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

   personalities can substantially influence the ecology and evolution of

   adaptations. Here, we experimentally induced sex-change in the

   demonstrate the existence of tight cross-sex correlations for two
   behaviours with presumed different sex-specific optima. Individuals that
   were relatively more active and aggressive females were found to become
   relatively more active and aggressive males. By identifying personality
   as a potential genetic constraint on the resolution of intralocus sexual

   matured. In small enclosures, we experimentally tested their behavioral
   responses 1) in this novel environment and 2) to the confrontation with
   predator odor. Animals, which were more exploratory during the novel
   environment test, showed lower behavioral signs of anxiety during the
   predator test. Both responses were correlated with individual pup body
   mass, with subjects with higher body mass being more exploratory in the
   first test and showing lower levels of anxiety in the second. The
   animals' current body mass or age when being tested were not correlated
   with any of their responses. First, the correlated responses of the
   animals during the different contexts of the applied tests strongly
   suggest the existence of behavioral phenotypes in European rabbits.
   Second, and most importantly, our study provides evidence that an
   animal's early development can exert long-term effects on its
   personality type, although it is not clear whether body mass per se or
   some correlated physiological features drive the observed relationships.}},

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show
   individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and
   context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human
   personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a
   social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a
   behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response
   of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a
   foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower
   colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As
   for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel
   stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to
   known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model,
   we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response
   to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour
   over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used
   here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal
   personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural
   response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day
   basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{While the number of studies reporting the presence of individual
   behavioral consistency (animal personality, behavioral syndrome) has
   boomed in the recent years, there is still much controversy about the
   proximate and ultimate mechanisms resulting in the phenomenon. For
   instance, direct environmental effects during ontogeny (phenotypic
   plasticity) as the proximate mechanism behind the emergence of
   consistent individual differences in behavior are usually overlooked
   compared to environmental effects operating across generations (genetic
   adaptation). Here, we tested the effects of sociality and perceived
   predation risk during ontogeny on the strength of behavioral consistency
   in agile frog (Rana dalmatina) tadpoles in a factorial common garden
   experiment. Tadpoles reared alone and without predatory cues showed zero
   repeatability within (i.e., lack of personality) and zero correlation
   between (i.e., lack of syndrome) activity and risk-taking. On the other
   hand, cues from predators alone induced both activity and risk-taking
   personalities, while cues from predators and conspecifics together
   resulted in an activity - risk-taking behavioral syndrome. Our results
   show that individual experience has an unequivocal role in the emergence
   of behavioral consistency. In this particular case, the development of
   behavioral consistency was most likely the result of genotype 9
   environment interactions, or with other words, individual variation in
   behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{It has been widely supported that individual animals express different
   strategies to cope with environmental challenge. In ectothermic species
   such as fish, individuals must use behavioral thermoregulation
   mechanisms to optimize physiological performance. In the present study,
   thermal preference was tested in groups of wild-type zebrafish, Danio
   rerio, screened for proactive and reactive animal personalities. Three
   replicate groups of proactive, reactive, and naive randomly sampled
   non-screened controls were used for the experiments. The frequency
   distribution of the animals was recorded in a custom-built multichamber
   tank under both constant temperature (temperature restricted conditions:
   T-R) and a continuous thermal gradient profile (temperature choice: T-Ch
   ranging from 21 degrees C to 35 degrees C). Proactive and reactive
   animal personalities expressed significantly different thermal
   preferences and general activity within the temperature gradient. Our
   results show that proactive fish, generally characterized as being more
   aggressive, bold risk takers, and prone to routine formation, have a
   preference for higher temperature environments. Reactive fish, which are
   shy, less risk-prone, and more flexible, favor medium colder
   temperatures. This is the first report of thermopreferendum in zebrafish
   where individual animal personality coupled to freedom of thermal choice
   has been applied to understand variation in individual preferences
   within a population.}},

Abstract = {{Male expected reproductive success can be enhanced by increased mating
   success (mate number) or, when females can mate multiply, by increased
   mating exclusivity (i.e., reduced partner promiscuity). A positive or
   negative covariance between these two mating outcomes could
   substantially increase or decrease overall variation in male expected
   reproductive success, yet the relationship between these mating outcomes
   is relatively understudied. We examined this relationship and the
   influence of male personality traits, female personality traits, and the
   social environment on mating outcomes in stream water striders, Aquarius
   remigis, at two experimental sex ratios: equal and 2:1 male-biased. To
   our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify this full set of
   effects. We found that mating frequency (mating success) and mating
   exclusivity were positively correlated in the male-biased treatment, but
   were not related at equal sex ratios. At both sex ratios, males that
   were more active and aggressive had both higher mating frequency and
   higher mating exclusivity. A male's effective mating (the product of
   mating frequency and mating exclusivity) was also higher if on average
   he mated with females that tended to hide in refuges (and were
   presumably less available for future matings). Finally, males that were
   more often in pools with extremely aggressive ({''}hyperaggressive{''})
   males actually had increased mating exclusivity, potentially because
   hyperaggression reduced average female promiscuity. This study
   highlights the importance of considering mating outcomes beyond mating
   success and examining the simultaneous contribution of male behaviours,
   female behaviours and social factors to mating dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The presence or absence of social counterparts can be instrumental in
   shaping both individual and collective behaviors. Furthermore, factors
   of the social environment may safeguard individuals from environmental
   stressors. In the study reported here, we tested the effects of moving
   into a new habitat on the mean, variance, and repeatability of
   individual behavioral tendencies between two social contexts (isolated
   vs. in a social group). Using the arid social spider, Stegodyphus
   dumicola (Araneae: Eresidae), we tested whether individuals' boldness
   was influenced by either (i) their time spent in a social group or (ii)
   their latency since having moved into a new habitat. We found that the
   effect of moving into a new habitat on individuals' boldness depended on
   whether spiders entered the novel environment in isolation or as part of
   a social group. Spiders that experienced a habitat shift with a social
   group showed no change in their average boldness, whereas individuals
   that shifted environments in isolation showed an increase in their mean
   boldness. Interestingly, neither of these trends was influenced by the
   time which had elapsed since the habitat shift, suggesting that shifting
   habitats has a lasting effect on isolated spiders' behavioral
   tendencies. Finally, we assessed how time spent in a new environment
   influenced colonies' collective foraging behavior. Here, we found that
   the longer social groups remained in a new environment, the faster the
   group responded to prey. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the
   effects of shifting physical environments on individuals' boldness may
   depend on individuals' social context, and that group tenure is
   associated with subtle shifts in colonies' collective foraging behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Different behavioral traits often covary, forming a behavioral syndrome.
   It is poorly known whether this covariance occurs on the
   between-individual level and what its selective consequences are. We
   used repeated measures (N = 562 observation events) of individual tawny
   owl Strix aluco females (N = 237) to study the integrated effects of
   seasonal timing of reproduction and clutch size on boldness displayed
   during defense of their clutch, in relation to plumage coloration,
   including local recruit production as a selective force on these traits.
   Using a Bayesian multivariate mixed model, we quantified the covariances
   between these traits on phenotypic, residual, and between-individual
   level and used a structural equation modeling approach to test the
   significance of presumed causal relationship between these traits in an
   a priori hypothesized path. On the phenotypic level, boldness was
   determined through early timing of breeding and larger clutch size, and
   early breeding increased recruitment probability. However, this
   relationship was entirely due to residual covariances and was not
   present on the between-individual level. The low individual-level
   correlations did not constrain the capacity of the population to respond
   to evolution as quantified by average autonomy (a metric summarizing
   evolutionary constraint on multiple traits). In the tawny owl, the
   association between early breeding and bold behavior, which is favored
   by selection, is solely due to extrinsic, nonheritable factors. We
   conclude that phenotypic evidence is insufficient to demonstrate
   syndrome covariance.}},

Title = {{Testing for correlations between behaviours in a cuckoo host: why do
   host defences not covary?}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Fitness costs associated with brood parasitism have led host species to
   evolve several lines of defence. The first two lines of defence,
   aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at
   varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how
   these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with
   previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A
   theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that
   variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual
   variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined
   whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection
   behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the
   context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler,
   Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as
   a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high
   individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest
   guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest
   guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated
   with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation
   between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest
   defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood
   parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency
   to these responses did not correlate with any of the female
   defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately,
   this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent
   cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns
   were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo
   host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather
   than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence
   behaviour against adult brood parasites in general. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Behavioral type-environment correlations occur when specific behavioral
   types of individuals are more common in certain environments. Behavioral
   type-environment correlations can be generated by several different
   mechanisms that are probably very common such as niche construction and
   phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, behavioral type-environment
   correlations have important ecological and evolutionary implications.
   However, few studies have examined behavioral type-environment
   correlations in natural populations. In this study, we asked whether
   some behavioral types of three-spined stickleback were more likely to
   occur in certain social environments (alone or in a shoal with other
   stickleback) or in certain microhabitats in a river (in the open or
   under cover). We found that individuals that were in shoals with other
   stickleback at the time of collection from the field emerged from a
   refuge more quickly compared to individuals that were found alone. In
   addition, fish that were alone in an open microhabitat explored more of
   a pool compared to fish that were alone in cover, but this difference
   did not occur among fish that were in shoals at the time of collection.
   Subsequent analyses of gut contents suggested that differences in
   microhabitat use were consistent over time. Our study provides some of
   the first evidence for behavioral type-environment correlations in a
   natural population of non-human animals.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous forces of selection associated with fluctuating
   environments are recognized as important factors involved in the
   maintenance of inter-individual phenotypic variance within populations.
   Consistent behavioural differences over time and across situations (e.g.
   personality) are increasingly cited as examples of individual variation
   observed within populations. However, the suggestion that heterogeneous
   selective pressures target different animal personalities remains
   largely untested in the wild. In this 5-year study, we investigated the
   dynamics of viability selection on a personality trait, exploration, in
   a population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) experiencing
   substantial seasonal variations in weather conditions and food
   availability associated with masting trees. Contrary to our
   expectations, we found no evidence of fluctuating selection on
   exploration. Instead, we found strong disruptive viability selection on
   adult exploration behaviour, independent of seasonal variations.
   Individuals with either low or high exploration scores were almost twice
   as likely to survive over a 6-month period compared with individuals
   with intermediate scores. We found no evidence of viability selection on
   juvenile exploration. Our results highlight that disruptive selection
   might play an important role in the maintenance of phenotypic variance
   of wild populations through its effect on different personality types
   across temporally varying environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Temperament differs among individuals both within and between species.
   Evidence suggests that differences in temperament of group members may
   parallel differences in social behavior among groups or between species.
   Here, we compared temperament between three closely related species of
   monkeyrhesus (Macaca mulatta), long-tailed (M. fascicularis), and
   pigtailed (M. nemestrina) macaquesusing cage-front behavioral
   observations of individually housed monkeys at a National Primate
   Research Center. Frequencies of 12 behaviors in 899 subjects were
   analyzed using a principal components analysis to identify temperament
   components. The analysis identified four components, which we
   interpreted as Sociability toward humans, Cautiousness, Aggressiveness,
   and Fearfulness. Species and sexes differed in their average scores on
   these components, even after controlling for differences in age and
   early-life experiences. Our results suggest that rhesus macaques are
   especially aggressive and unsociable toward humans, long-tailed macaques
   are more cautious and fearful, and pigtailed macaques are more sociable
   toward humans and less aggressive than the other species. Pigtailed
   males were notably more sociable than any other group. The differences
   observed are consistent with reported variation in these species' social
   behaviors, as rhesus macaques generally engage in more social aggression
   and pigtailed macaques engage in more malemale affiliative behaviors.
   Differences in predation risks are among the socioecological factors
   that might make these species-typical behaviors adaptive. Our results
   suggest that adaptive species-level social differences may be encoded in
   individual-level temperaments, which are manifested even outside of a
   social context. Am. J. Primatol. 75:303-313, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{799-811}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that repeated assays of behaviour, conducted
   both within and across situations, could reveal important insights into
   two traditionally distinct areas of study: animal personality and
   individual differences in behavioural plasticity. However, at present
   relatively few studies present such data, and few consider how changing
   abiotic conditions affect behavioural plasticity. Individual differences
   in metabolic rate have been suggested as a proximate mechanism promoting
   personality, leading one to speculate that individual differences in
   metabolic sensitivity to temperature may affect behavioural responses in
   ectotherms. At present, only one study (out of two) has tested for and
   shown individual differences in behavioural responses to temperature.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed the behaviour of a marine crab across a
   narrow range of temperatures to test for individual differences in
   responses to temperature. We observed large inter-individual differences
   in behaviour that were consistent over time at a given temperature
   (evidence for personality), and individual differences in responses to
   temperature (evidence for plasticity). This study adds to the very scant
   literature on ectotherm behavioural sensitivity to temperature, and
   suggests the phenomenon might be widespread. We speculate about the role
   of metabolism as a proximate mechanism that might explain these
   individual differences in plasticity and make suggestions for future
   research to test this hypothesis.}},

Title = {{Human Perceptions of Coat Color as an Indicator of Domestic Cat
   Personality}},
Journal = {{ANTHROZOOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{427-440}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Associations between mammalian coat color and behavior have been
   investigated in a number of species, most notably the study of silver
   foxes by the Institute of Cytology and Genetics at the Russian Academy
   of Sciences. However, the few studies conducted regarding a potential
   relation between coat color and domestic cat personality have shown
   mixed results, even though many people believe that differently colored
   cats have distinct personalities. Understanding how humans might
   perceive personality in relation to coat color may have important
   ramifications regarding whether cats are relinquished to shelters or
   adopted from them. In order to assess human perceptions of differently
   colored cats, we conducted an anonymous, online survey, using a 7-point
   Likert scale and 10 terms describing personality traits that were chosen
   based on previous studies of animal personality. This survey examined
   how people assigned these given terms (active, aloof, bold, calm,
   friendly, intolerant, shy, stubborn, tolerant, and trainable) to five
   different colors of cats (orange, tri-colored, white, black, and
   bi-colored). There were significant differences in how participants in
   this study chose to assign personality terms to differently colored
   cats. For example, participants (n = 189) were more likely to attribute
   the trait ``friendliness{''} to orange cats, ``intolerance{''} to
   tri-colored cats, and ``aloofness{''} to white and tri-colored cats. No
   significant differences were found for ``stub-bornness{''} in any colors
   of cats. White cats were seen as less bold and active and more shy and
   calm than other colors of cats. While survey respondents stated that
   they placed more importance on personality than color when selecting a
   companion cat, there is some evidence that they believe the two
   qualities are linked. We anticipate our findings will be relevant to
   further study in domestic cat personality and to those who work in
   animal rescue, particularly in how shelters promote differently colored
   cats and educate potential adopters.}},

Title = {{Boldness in two perch populations - long-term differences and the effect

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1311-1318}},

Abstract = {{1. Populations of the same species often display different behaviours,
   for example, in their response to predators. The question is whether
   this difference is developed as part of a divergent selection caused by
   differences in predation pressure, or as a result of phenotypic
   responses to current environmental conditions.
   2. Two populations of Eurasian perch were investigated over a time span
   of 6 years to see whether risk-taking behaviour in young-of-the-year
   perch were consistent across cohorts, or if behaviour varied over time
   with changes in predation regime.
   3. Boldness was estimated in aquarium studies by looking at how the fish
   made trade-offs between foraging in a risky area and staying in shelter.
   Predation risk of each year and lake was estimated from fishing surveys,
   using an individual-based model calculating attack rates for
   cannibalistic perch.
   4. The average boldness scores were consistently lower in perch from
   Fisksjon compared with those in Angersjon, although the magnitude of the
   difference varied among years. Variance component analyses showed that
   differences between lakes in boldness scores only explained 12 per cent
   of the total variation. Differences between years were contributing at
   least similarly or more to the total variance, and the variation was
   higher in Fisksjon than in Angersjon.
   5. The observed risk-taking behaviour of young-of-the-year perch,
   compared across cohorts, was significantly correlated with the
   year-specific estimates of cannibalistic attack rates, with lower
   boldness scores in years with higher predation pressure. In Fisksjon,
   with significant changes over the years in population structure, the
   range of both predation risk and boldness scores was wider than in
   Angersjon.
   6. By following the two perch populations over several years, we have
   been able to show that the differences in risk-taking behaviour mainly
   are due to direct phenotypic responses to recent experience of predation
   risk. Long-term differences in behaviour among perch populations thus
   reflect consistent differences in predation regime rather than diverging
   inherent traits.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals in many animal species exhibit `personality,' consistent
   differences in behaviour across time, situations and/or contexts.
   Previous work has revealed a negative genetic correlation between
   intensity of tonic immobility and walking activity levels in the
   confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, thus suggesting these beetles
   exhibit personality in activity-related traits. The present study
   investigated the mechanism underlying this correlation. We used
   individuals derived from two strains established via artificial
   divergent selection for duration of tonic immobility. ``Long{''} (L)
   strains exhibited higher frequencies and longer durations of tonic
   immobility, and lower activity levels, while ``Short{''} (S) strains
   exhibited lower frequencies and shorter durations of tonic immobility
   and higher activity levels. We found that the duration of tonic
   immobility, and activity level, could be altered by caffeine
   administration; L strains fed with caffeine exhibited decreased
   durations of tonic immobility and increased activity levels. We also
   found that brain dopamine levels were lower in L strains than in S
   strains. Consequently, this study demonstrates that the dopaminergic
   system plays an important part in controlling the genetic correlation
   between tonic immobility and activity levels in this species. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Despite rapidly accumulating evidence for the existence of consistent
   individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours (i.e. `animal
   personalities'), little is known about proximate mechanisms causing such
   variation. Individual variation in circulating levels of testosterone
   (T) is often hypothesized to underpin personality traits such as
   aggressiveness and exploratory behaviour. Here we provide a
   comprehensive test of this hypothesis. We quantified variation in
   exploratory behaviour of a novel environment in a captive population of
   wild-caught male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then investigated
   the relationship between the observed behaviours and circulating levels
   of T, using two approaches. First, we tested whether measures of
   exploratory behaviour correlated with (1) point-sampled plasma T levels
   and (2) T-dependent ornamentation (bill coloration) in 114 males.
   Neither direct nor indirect estimates of individual variation in T
   levels were correlated with the assayed behaviours. Second, we
   experimentally increased plasma T levels of 21 males with T implants,
   using 21 placebo-implanted males as a control group. Experimentally
   induced between-individual variation in T levels did not increase the
   amount of between-individual variation in exploratory behaviour. Our
   results thus strongly suggest that, in house sparrows,
   between-individual variation in circulating levels of T cannot serve as
   a causal explanation for the existence of individual variation in
   exploratory behaviour. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Variation in life history (LH) traits along the fast-slow continuum
   (referred to as pace of life, POL) is thought to result from a trade-off
   between investments in current versus future reproduction. Originally
   developed for understanding variation in LH strategies at the
   among-population level, the POL theory has more recently been applied
   towards understanding variation in LH traits at the within-population
   level, and further extended to address the covariance of LH traits with
   additional behavioural and/or physiological traits, referred to as
   pace-of-life syndromes (POLS). The article by Reale et al. (Philos T Roy
   Soc B 365: 4051-4063, 2010), which synthesized several earlier reviews
   and opinions on among-individual covariation between LH, behavioural,
   and physiological traits, and subsequent research testing POLS in a
   variety of species, have collectively been cited several hundreds of
   times-a trend that continues. These works have interdisciplinary impact,
   informing research in life history biology, behavioural and
   developmental biology, and the social sciences. In this paper, we review
   the existing theoretical POLS models that provide adaptive explanations
   for covariances between LH traits and additional behavioural and/or
   physiological traits while assuming a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. We find that the set of relevant models is small.
   Moreover, models show that covariances between life history traits and
   behavioural or physiological traits can arise even in the absence of a
   current-future reproduction trade-off, implying that observing such
   covariances does not provide a strong indication regarding the process
   generating POLS. We discuss lessons learned from existing models of
   POLS, highlight key gaps in the modelling literature, and provide
   guidelines for better integration between theory and data.}},

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{43-53}},

Abstract = {{Variation in common personality traits, such as boldness or exploration,
   is often associated with risk-reward trade-offs and behavioural
   flexibility. To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of
   consistent behavioural traits on both learning and cognition. We
   investigated whether certain personality traits ('exploration' and
   `sociability') of individuals were related to cognitive performance,
   learning flexibility and learning style in a social ungulate species,
   the goat (Capra hircus). We also investigated whether a preference for
   feature cues rather than impaired learning abilities can explain
   performance variation in a visual discrimination task. We found that
   personality scores were consistent across time and context. Less
   explorative goats performed better in a non-associative cognitive task,
   in which subjects had to follow the trajectory of a hidden object (i.e.
   testing their ability for object permanence). We also found that less
   sociable subjects performed better compared to more sociable goats in a
   visual discrimination task. Good visual learning performance was
   associated with a preference for feature cues, indicating
   personality-dependent learning strategies in goats. Our results suggest
   that personality traits predict the outcome in visual discrimination and
   non-associative cognitive tasks in goats and that impaired performance
   in a visual discrimination tasks does not necessarily imply impaired
   learning capacities, but rather can be explained by a varying preference
   for feature cues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{69-79}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality has become a major topic in animal behaviour. Much
   recent progress has come from the use of the open-field test, which is
   routinely used to separate individuals into fast and slow explorers.
   However, there is no standard way to conduct the test and it is unclear
   whether the test really measures exploration. Here, we addressed these
   issues by combining an open-field test with a battery of independent
   assays intended to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of
   the behavioural traits suggested to measure exploration in the
   open-field test. Our study subjects were common mynas, Acridotheres
   tristis, introduced to Australia. The analyses confirmed that the
   open-field test allows individuals to be separated according to their
   propensity to explore, mainly through metrics related to spatial and
   object examination of the novel cage. However, other metrics classically
   used to describe exploratory behaviour, such as the latency to enter the
   novel space, reflected shyness rather than exploration. The open-field
   test can therefore be a powerful tool to investigate personality, but
   only if the biological meanings of the metrics derived from the test are
   properly validated with independent behavioural assays. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal
   species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across
   time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general
   relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild
   populations, which raises the question as to how variation in
   personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating
   selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute
   to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild
   populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we
   investigated the relationship between individual personality differences
   and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a
   population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences
   considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated
   trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using
   capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a
   1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus
   ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found
   that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food
   availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability.
   Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to
   maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.}},

Abstract = {{Common carp that had been screened for stress coping style using a
   standard behavioural test (response to a novel environment) were given a
   learning task in which food was concealed in one of two compartments,
   its location randomised between trials and its presence in a given
   compartment signalled by either a red or a yellow light. All the fish
   learned to find food quickly, but did so in different ways. Fifty five
   percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder
   achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To
   explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping
   style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp
   classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow
   the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish
   that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials
   to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish. These results
   add to the growing body of information on within-species variation in
   learning strategies and suggest a possible influence of stress coping
   style on the use of associative learning as opposed to algorithmic
   searching during foraging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how behavioural traits co-vary within and between
   individuals is a major aim of behavioural ecologists working across a
   wide range of taxa. Here we attempted to measure five key behavioural
   traits (aggression, boldness, exploration, activity and sociability) in
   a native Australian social skink, Egernia whitii. Specifically, we
   documented the temporal consistency of trait structural definition, the
   temporal consistency of trait expression and the relationships between
   behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We found (1) that the
   structural consistency of some traits (boldness), but not others
   (aggressiveness and exploration), changed across time and according to
   sex (i.e. the relationship between the raw behaviours that were measured
   in the boldness assay was different for males and females); (2) that
   three of the five behavioural traits exhibited moderate-to-high adjusted
   repeatability while two were not repeatable; (3) covariances between
   behavioural traits were weak to non-existent and did not support the
   presence of any behavioural syndromes. These results indicate that
   structural consistency of traits or the behavioural definition' of an
   aggregate score is potentially variable over time. This may limit
   inference on any subsequent estimates of repeatability of behavioural
   traits, as well as estimates of potential syndromes. Repeatability of
   behavioural traits may reflect underlying ecological importance, or
   measurement processes, and lack of behavioural syndromes may reflect
   lack of selection pressure for trait covariance. Studies examining
   multiple behavioural traits under a measurement as well as an ecological
   framework are crucial to make meaningful inferences regarding the
   ecological and evolutionary significance of behavioural traits.}},

Abstract = {{Animals often exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and correlations between behaviors (i.e.,
   behavioral syndromes), yet the causes of those patterns of behavioral
   variation remain insufficiently understood. Many authors hypothesize
   that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral
   syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation
   among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results.
   New statistical methods that partition correlations into
   between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an
   opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors
   and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration,
   and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and
   nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine
   whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive
   phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent
   individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual
   level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both
   traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a
   behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition
   negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration.
   Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent,
   which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes,
   feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce
   consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between
   them.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality is considered to be subject to natural selection, and
   measuring its fitness consequences is an important step in the study of
   the evolution of this phenomenon. The evolutionary costs and benefits of
   certain personality traits are frequently assumed to fluctuate across
   different life history stages. However, little is still known about
   survival consequences of personality during juvenile life. We predicted
   survival costs of exploration tendency in juvenile European rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which we studied under quasi-natural
   conditions. In addition, consistencies between exploration and the
   animal's behavioral responses in other contexts were tested. Early
   exploratory behavior was assessed in two annual cohorts, either
   observationally by quantifying the time course of exploring the area
   around the nursery burrow shortly after emergence above ground or
   experimentally by conducting open-field tests shortly before emergence.
   In both years, the study revealed consistent results: more exploratory
   individuals had a lower chance of survival until the end of the
   vegetation period, presumably due to a higher predation risk. Fast
   explorers, as assessed by their exploration of the burrow environment,
   were also less sociable and tended to be more aggressive toward
   conspecifics as subadults. Sociability was repeatable across time.
   Furthermore, fast explorers, as assessed by their open-field behavior,
   were bolder in a handling test before emergence. These consistencies
   across context and time suggest the existence of personality. In
   conclusion, the results provide evidence for survival costs of fast
   exploration during juvenile life. The findings are in line with
   predictions on personality-related life history variation.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms can respond to and cope with stressful environments in a
   number of ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological
   adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal
   adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying)
   activity, flight performance and morphology of three European
   populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from
   different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign
   and stressful high temperatures. Spanish flies showed greater heat
   resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high
   temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the
   shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight
   performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further
   (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor
   activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able
   to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population
   differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained
   using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden
   setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high
   temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective
   agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the
   populations. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The evolutionary function and maintenance of variation in animal
   personality is still under debate. Variation in the size of metabolic
   organs has recently been suggested to cause and maintain variation in
   personality. Here, we examine two main underlying notions: (i) that
   organ sizes vary consistently between individuals and cause consistent
   behavioural patterns, and (ii) that a more exploratory personality is
   associated with reduced survival. Exploratory behaviour of captive red
   knots (Calidris canutus, a migrant shorebird) was negatively rather than
   positively correlated with digestive organ (gizzard) mass, as well as
   with body mass. In an experiment, we reciprocally reduced and increased
   individual gizzard masses and found that exploration scores were
   unaffected. Whether or not these birds were resighted locally over the
   19 months after release was negatively correlated with their exploration
   scores. Moreover, a long-term mark-recapture effort on free-living red
   knots with known gizzard masses at capture confirmed that local
   resighting probability (an inverse measure of exploratory behaviour) was
   correlated with gizzard mass without detrimental effects on survival. We
   conclude that personality drives physiological adjustments, rather than
   the other way around, and suggest that physiological adjustments
   mitigate the survival costs of exploratory behaviour. Our results show
   that we need to reconsider hypotheses explaining personality variation
   based on organ sizes and differential survival.}},

Title = {{Repeatable nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior, or personality, have been
   demonstrated in a variety of species other than humans, including
   mammals, birds, and invertebrates. Behavioral consistency has been shown
   to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses,
   which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite
   increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest
   defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations.
   Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have
   utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive
   behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to
   fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency
   across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for
   accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically
   relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow
   (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild
   population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest
   defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and
   females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females:
   2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if
   individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood
   size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found
   that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between
   years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was
   influenced by season in the other year. Parental age, brood size, and
   the number of house sparrows around the nest site did not affect nest
   defense behavior. We conclude that Eastern bluebirds demonstrate
   consistent nest defense behavior, or personality, although males are
   more plastic than females.}},

   asked how confident they were in using each of the different Big Five
   scales in describing their horse: neuroticism and extraversion were
   rated with most confidence and openness to experience with least
   confidence. Taking both our own factors above and the NEO scales, some
   comparisons between the working roles of the horse were significant; for
   example, horses used for teaching were less extraverted than show
   jumpers. Sophistication of working role also related to personality; for
   example, international horses were less extraverted than novices. We

Abstract = {{1. Fast and slow life histories are proposed to covary with consistent
   individual differences in behaviour, but little is known whether it
   holds in the wild, where individuals experience natural fluctuations of
   the environment.
   2. We investigated whether individual differences in behaviour, such as
   movement traits and prey selection, are linked to variation in
   life-history traits in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in the wild.
   3. Using high-resolution acoustic telemetry, we collected the positional
   data of fish in a whole natural lake and estimated individual movement
   traits by fitting a two-state correlated random walk model. Prey
   selection was inferred from stable isotope analysis using scale samples.
   Life-history traits were estimated by fitting a biphasic growth model to
   an individual growth trajectory back-calculated from scale samples.
   4. Life-history traits were correlated with behavioural traits such as
   movements and prey selection. Individuals with higher reproductive
   effort were found to switch more frequently between active and inactive
   modes and show greater reliance on prey from pelagic pathways (indicated
   by lower delta C-13). Further, individuals with faster juvenile growth
   were found to stay active for a longer time during the adult stage.
   5. Our results demonstrate the link between individual behavioural
   differences and fast-slow life-history traits under ecologically
   relevant conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Environmental temperature gradients provide habitat structure in
   which fish orientate and individual thermal choice may reflect an
   essential integrated response to the environment. The use of subtle
   thermal gradients likely impacts upon specific physiological and
   behavioural processes reflected as a suite of traits described by animal
   personality. In this study, we examine the relationship between thermal
   choice, animal personality and the impact of infection upon this
   interaction.
   2. We predicted that thermal choice in Nile tilapia Oreochromis
   niloticus reflects distinct personality traits and that under a
   challenge individuals exhibit differential thermal distribution.
   3. Nile tilapia were screened following two different protocols: 1) a
   suite of individual behavioural tests to screen for personality and 2)
   thermal choice in a custom-built tank with a thermal gradient (TCH tank)
   ranging from 21 to 33 degrees C. A first set of fish were screened for
   behaviour and then thermal preference, and a second set were tested in
   the opposite fashion: thermal then behaviour. The final thermal
   distribution of the fish after 48 h was assessed reflecting final
   thermal preferendum. Additionally, fish were then challenged using a
   bacterial Streptococcus iniae model infection to assess the behavioural
   fever response of proactive and reactive fish.
   4. Results showed that individuals with preference for higher
   temperatures were also classified as proactive with behavioural tests
   and reactive contemporaries chose significantly lower water
   temperatures. All groups exhibited behavioural fever recovering
   personality-specific thermal preferences after 5 days.
   5. Our results show that thermal preference can be used as a proxy to
   assess personality traits in Nile tilapia and it is a central factor to
   understand the adaptive meaning of animal personality within a
   population. Importantly, response to infection by expressing behavioural
   fever overrides personality-related thermal choice.}},

Abstract = {{Survival depends on appropriate behavioural and physiological responses
   to danger. In addition to active fight-flight' defence responses, a
   passive freeze-hide' response is adaptive in some contexts. However, the
   physiological mechanisms determining which individuals choose a given
   defence response remain poorly understood. We examined the relationships
   among personality, metabolic performance and physiological stress
   responses across an environmental gradient in the olive flounder,
   Paralichthys olivaceus. We employed four behavioural assays to document
   the existence of two distinct behavioural types (bold' and shy') in this
   species. We found consistent metabolic differences between individuals
   of a given behavioural type across an environmental gradient: shy
   individuals had overall lower aerobic scope, maximum metabolic rate and
   standard metabolic rate than bold individuals in both high (25 ppt) and
   low (3 ppt) salinity. These behavioural and metabolic differences
   translated into divergent physiological responses during acute stress:
   shy individuals adopted a passive freeze-hide' response by reducing
   their oxygen consumption rates (akin to shallow breathing) whereas bold
   individuals adopted an active fight-flight' response by increasing their
   rates of respiration. These distinct defence strategies were repeatable
   within individuals between salinity treatments. Although it has been
   suggested theoretically, this is the first empirical evidence that the
   metabolic response to stressful situations differs between bold and shy
   individuals. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating
   physiological measures to understand the mechanisms driving persistent
   inter-individual differences in animals.}},

   field crickets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Selection may favour individuals of the same population to differ
   consistently in nutritional preference, for example, because optimal
   diets covary with morphology or personality. We provided Southern field
   crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) with two synthetic food sources
   (carbohydrates and proteins) and quantified repeatedly how much of each
   macronutrient was consumed by each individual. We then quantified (i)
   whether individuals were repeatable in carbohydrate and protein intake
   rate, (ii) whether an individual's average daily intake of carbohydrates
   was correlated with its average daily intake of protein, and (iii)
   whether short-term changes in intake of carbohydrates coincided with
   changes in intake of protein within individuals. Intake rates were
   individually repeatable for both macronutrients. However, individuals
   differed in their relative daily intake of carbohydrates versus proteins
   (i.e., `nutritional preference'). By contrast, total consumption varied
   plastically as a function of body weight within individuals. Body
   weight-but not personality (i.e., aggression, exploration
   behaviour)positively predicted nutritional preference at the individual
   level as large crickets repeatedly consumed a higher carbohydrate to
   protein ratio compared to small ones. Our finding of level-specific
   associations between the consumption of distinct nutritional components
   demonstrates the merit of applying multivariate and multi-level
   viewpoints to the study of nutritional preference.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, i.e. consistent individual differences in
   behaviour, are currently of high interest among behavioural and
   evolutionary biologists. The topic has received increasing attention
   also in fisheries science because selective harvesting of certain
   behavioural types might impose fishing-induced selection on personality.
   Here, we ice-fished wild Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) from three
   native populations and investigated whether differences in relative
   catchability would explain behavioural differences observed in
   experimental conditions. We inferred relative catchability differences
   indirectly by fishing each location first with generally inefficient
   artificial bait and then by more efficient natural bait. The captured,
   individually tagged fish were tested in groups for their exploration
   tendency, activity and boldness under authentic predation risk in
   semi-natural stream channels. Fish that were easily captured first with
   artificial bait expressed fast exploration and acute activity, whereas
   the fish captured with natural bait showed less active and explorative
   behaviour. Differences in relative catchability did not explain
   variation in boldness or body size. In conclusion, we found that (1)
   Eurasian perch differing in relative catchability differ in certain
   behavioural traits, (2) fast explorers are more common among fish that
   get easily caught compared to fish that are more difficult to catch, (3)
   relative catchability explains more behavioural variation in a novel
   environment than in a familiar one and (4) selectivity of recreational
   angling on fish behaviour may depend on applied angling method and the
   effort spent on each location.}},

Title = {{Recent social conditions affect boldness repeatability in individual

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and have
   been shown both to influence individual behaviour in the social context
   and to be affected by it. However, little attention has been paid to
   possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality
   expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated
   how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of
   three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual
   assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or
   socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking
   task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness
   repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing
   much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for
   which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a
   temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed
   solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial.
   These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the
   short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of
   personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This
   finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when
   designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between
   animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role
   of social carryover effects. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency is a key assumption when evaluating how
   between-individual differences in behaviour influence life history
   tactics. Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural
   repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural
   repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have
   investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status
   (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed
   to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the
   repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to
   human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at
   both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural
   trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly
   between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males
   than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual
   variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with
   individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life
   history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report
   here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{Personality affects mate choice: bolder males show stronger audience
   effects under high competition}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1314-1325}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Males in various species adjust their mate choice to sperm competition
   risk and intensity arising when females potentially mate with several
   competing males. If males use social information and copy other males'
   choices, this leads to an increased likelihood of sperm competition for
   both, the copying and the copied male. In livebearing fishes
   (Poeciliidae), males appear to avoid the risk of being copied by
   temporarily moving away from preferred females and approaching
   nonpreferred ones ({''}audience effect{''}), thereby exploiting the
   rival's propensity to copy. Responding to rival presence with an
   audience effect bears the risk of losing the initially preferred female,
   which may swim away, but may help to reduce sperm competition intensity.
   Males may rate this risk-benefit ratio differentially depending on their
   personality, for example, more risk-taking (bolder) males might be more
   likely to respond to an audience. Using Atlantic mollies (Poecilia
   mexicana) as our study organism, we characterized focal and audience
   males along the boldness-activity behavioral axis. As overall
   competition levels are known to affect male mate choice, we subjected
   half of the males to a low competition (single-male housing) and the
   other half to a high-competition treatment (group housing) before they
   were tested in binary mate choice tests. Only males from the high
   competition treatment responded to rival presence with an audience
   effect. In congruence with our prediction, bolder males within this
   cohort showed a stronger audience effect. Our study exemplifies that
   (depending on the social context) bolder, not shyer, individuals can be
   more responsive to their social environment.}},

Journal = {{INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{541-548}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have focused on the role of behavior in biological
   invasions. Individuals may differ consistently in time for several
   behavioral traits (personality) which covary (behavioral syndrome)
   resulting in different behavioral types, some of them favoring invasion.
   Social hymenopterans have a strong potential to be invaders and their
   success depends primarily on the foundresses' ability to found viable
   colonies. They are expected to be active, explorative and bold for
   optimally establishing their nest. In Europe, 2 hornet species coexist:
   the native Vespa crabro and the invasive Vespa velutina. These 2 species
   may compete for nesting sites and we suggest that the initial success of
   V. velutina has been favored by its behavior in outperforming V. crabro
   for the traits involved in nest initiation. Here, we (i) defined the
   personality of V. crabro and V. velutina, (ii) tested for the existence
   of behavioral syndrome in these species, and (iii) compared their
   performances using an open-field test. Our results show that V. crabro
   foundresses behave consistently but not V. velutina; this lack of
   consistency being mainly due to reduced variance among individuals. This
   result questions the possibility of detecting consistent behavioral
   differences in species having recently undergone a strong bottleneck.
   Both species exhibit the same correlations between activity, boldness
   and exploration and V. velutina clearly outperforms V. crabro for all
   traits. Our results suggest that activity, boldness, and exploration are
   implicated in both hornet nest initiation and invasion process which
   contributed to explain why social hymenopterans are so successful at
   colonization.}},

Abstract = {{Non-random mortality associated with commercial and recreational
   fisheries have the potential to cause evolutionary changes in fish
   populations. Inland recreational fisheries offer unique opportunities
   for the study of fisheries induced evolution due to the ability to
   replicate study systems, limited gene flow among populations, and the
   existence of unexploited reference populations. Experimental research
   has demonstrated that angling vulnerability is heritable in Largemouth
   Bass Micropterus salmoides, and is correlated with elevated resting
   metabolic rates (RMR) and higher fitness. However, whether such
   differences are present in wild populations is unclear. This study
   sought to quantify differences in RMR among replicated exploited and
   unexploited populations of Largemouth Bass. We collected age-0
   Largemouth Bass from two Connecticut drinking water reservoirs
   unexploited by anglers for almost a century, and two exploited lakes,
   then transported and reared them in the same pond. Field RMR of
   individuals from each population was quantified using intermittent-flow
   respirometry. Individuals from unexploited reservoirs had a
   significantly higher mean RMR (6\%) than individuals from exploited
   populations. These findings are consistent with expectations derived
   from artificial selection by angling on Largemouth Bass, suggesting that
   recreational angling may act as an evolutionary force influencing the
   metabolic rates of fishes in the wild. Reduced RMR as a result of
   fisheries induced evolution may have ecosystem level effects on energy
   demand, and be common in exploited recreational populations globally.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the recent surge of interest in the concept of animal
   personalities, that is, temporally consistent individual differences in
   behavior, few studies have integrated intraspecific behavioral variation
   in population or community ecology. Insects and other arthropods provide
   ideal model systems to study how intraspecific behavioral variation
   affects phenomena in ecology. This is due to the fact that arthropods
   not only are highly amenable to experimental manipulation, but they also
   allow us to answer general ecological questions on multiple scales of
   biological organization. Herein, we review recent developments and views
   on how the framework of animal personality could provide a deeper
   understanding of classic issues in (1) population ecology (e.g., local
   adaptation, dispersal, and invasion), (2) community ecology (e.g., food
   webs and ecosystem engineering), and (3) more insect-focused topics such
   as metamorphosis and pollination biology.}},

Title = {{Similar nest defence strategies within pairs increase reproductive

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{174-182}},

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that individuals across a variety of taxa
   express consistent behavioural differences, or personality, which may
   affect reproductive success. Most previous studies of avian systems
   investigated the effects of individual personality on offspring
   recruitment and other fitness correlates, even in species with
   biparental care. Here we tested the potential for behavioural similarity
   within mated pairs of wild eastern bluebirds to impact reproductive
   success. Specifically, we quantified nest defence behaviour of males and
   females to address three hypotheses: (1) the individual personality
   hypothesis, which predicts that individuals with more aggressive
   personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging; (2) the pair
   coordination hypothesis, which predicts similarly behaving pairs will
   have more nestlings survive to fledging; and (3) the pair intensity
   hypothesis, which predicts pairs with more aggressive personalities will
   have more nestlings survive to fledging. Pairs that had similar nest
   defence strategies produced more fledglings in support of the pair
   coordination hypothesis. We found no support for either the individual
   personality hypothesis or the pair intensity hypothesis. Thus,
   particularly in species with biparental care, it is important to
   consider the behaviour of both pair members to predict effects on
   reproductive success. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animals are faced with many choices and a very important one is the
   choice of a mating partner. Inter-individual differences in mating
   preferences have been studied for some time, but most studies focus on
   the location of the peak preference rather than on other aspects of
   preference functions. In this review, we discuss the role of variation
   in choosiness in inter-sexual selection. We define individual-level
   choosiness as the change in mating propensity in response to different
   stimulus signals. We illustrate general issues in estimating aspects of
   preference functions and discuss experimental setups for quantifying
   variation in choosiness with a focus on choices based on acoustic
   signals in insects. One important consideration is whether preferences
   are measured sequentially one stimulus at a time or in competitive
   multiple-choice setups; the suitability of these alternatives depends on
   the ecology of the study species. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness
   of behavioural proxies for determining preference functions, which can
   be misleading if the proxies are not linearly related to mating
   propensity. Finally, we address statistical approaches, including the
   use of function-valued trait analysis, for studying choosiness. Most of
   the conclusions can be generalized beyond acoustic signals in insects
   and to choices in non-sexual contexts.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural phenotypes can be studied from a variety of perspectives.
   Recent developments have focused on the individual, seeking patterns of
   behaviour that are stable over time and/or across different contexts
   (animal personalities). This study applied this method of understanding
   individual behavioural variability to domestic guinea pigs. Two
   behavioural domains were investigated: emotionality and social
   behaviour. Additionally, individual cortisol-stress reactivity and
   dominance status were examined. Adult male domestic guinea pigs living
   in large mixed-sex colonies were subjected to a series of behavioural
   and physiological tests twice with an intertest interval of 8wk.
   Individual consistency over time was found regarding social behaviour,
   cortisol reactivity and dominance status, whereas no stability regarding
   emotional behaviour was detected. Furthermore, no stability over
   contexts was found. Our results suggest that the concept of animal
   personality is applicable to domestic guinea pigs. The ecological
   relevance of these data is underscored by the fact that they were
   obtained in animals from a very rich, socially complex scenario.
   Moreover, our study highlights that behaviour alone is not sufficient to
   describe individual phenotypic consistency. Physiological parameters
   such as stress reactivity should be included in animal personality
   research. Furthermore dominance - a relative measure which is not an
   absolute attribute of individuals - proved to be stable over time and
   thus also shed light on individuality.}},

   and mammals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Despite decades of research, some of the most basic issues concerning
   the extraordinarily complex brains and behavior of birds and mammals,
   such as the factors responsible for the diversity of brain size and
   composition, are still unclear. This is partly due to a number of
   conceptual and methodological issues. Determining species and group
   differences in brain composition requires accounting for the presence of
   taxon-cerebrotypes and the use of precise statistical methods. The role
   of allometry in determining brain variables should be revised. In
   particular, bird and mammalian brains appear to have evolved in response
   to a variety of selective pressures influencing both brain size and
   composition. ``Brain{''} and ``cognition{''} are indeed meta-variables,
   made up of the variables that are ecologically relevant and
   evolutionarily selected. External indicators of species differences in
   cognition and behavior are limited by the complexity of these
   differences. Indeed, behavioral differences between species and
   individuals are caused by cognitive and affective components. Although
   intra-species variability forms the basis of species evolution, some of
   the mechanisms underlying individual differences in brain and behavior
   appear to differ from those between species. While many issues have
   persisted over the years because of a lack of appropriate data or
   methods to test them; several fallacies, particularly those related to
   the human brain, reflect scientists' preconceptions. The theoretical
   framework on the evolution of brain, cognition, and behavior in birds
   and mammals should be reconsidered with these biases in mind.}},

Abstract = {{The current theories of animal personality are based on the observation
   that individual variation in behavior and physiology appears to be
   consistent across contexts. Rats of the Roman selection lines have been
   originally selected for differences in shuttle-box behavior. Besides
   differences in active avoidance, these animals differ more generally in
   coping style. Roman high avoidance (RHA) rats show high levels of active
   avoidance, whereas Roman low avoidance (RLA) rats tend to respond with a
   more passive (i.e. freezing) response. Based on the two tier model of
   coping styles, we hypothesized that RHA rats would show high levels of
   offensive behavior and are more impulsive compared to RLA rats. We
   characterized animals in a two-way active avoidance task on five
   consecutive days. Thereafter animals were tested for their level of
   offensive aggression and impulsive behavior. The level of offensive
   aggression was examined in a standard resident-intruder paradigm.
   Furthermore, we tested aspects of impulsivity in an unpredictable
   operant conditioning paradigm (variable interval-15 schedule) for food
   reinforcement and during extinction of lever press behavior. We show
   that RHA rats are indeed characterized by high levels of two-way active
   avoidance in a shuttle-box paradigm. Surprisingly, the level of
   offensive aggression was higher in RLA compared to RHA rats. Consistent
   with the coping style interpretation, the number of lever presses in the
   VI-15 schedule for food reinforcement was higher in RHA rats compared to
   RLA rats. During a session of frustrating non-reward, RHA rats were more
   persistent. Taken together, results of the two-way active avoidance task
   and VI-15 performance in rats of the Roman selection lines fit with the
   two tier model of coping styles. Unexpectedly, the level of offensive
   aggression does not match with this model.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in the environment favours foragers that are flexible
   (phenotypically plastic). However, consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (personality), such as in risk-taking, might affect an
   individual's ability to find food, avoid predators and adjust to new
   conditions. It is now well known that personalities exist in many taxa,
   but much less is known about individual variation in plasticity. We
   measured the tendency to begin foraging across different levels of risk
   in house sparrows (Passer domesticus), using a behavioural reaction norm
   framework to simultaneously assess personality and plasticity. We asked
   whether individuals were consistently different across risk levels, and
   whether they differed in habituation and neophobia, both of which were
   treated as cases of plasticity. We found that males habituated more than
   females by beginning to feed sooner after repeated instances of a human
   disturbance in the presence of an initially unfamiliar object.
   Individuals of both sexes also exhibited consistent differences across
   trials, but did not differ in the rate of habituation beyond the
   difference between the sexes. When a novel object was placed in the
   foraging area, both sexes exhibited similar degrees of neophobia by
   delaying feeding. The magnitude of this change varied among birds,
   indicating individual differences in neophobia. Our results indicate
   that both personality and individual variation in plasticity exist but
   should be treated as independent phenomena. The presence of variation in
   plasticity implies that the raw material necessary for selection on
   neophobia exists, and that if heritable, plasticity in risk-taking
   across contexts could evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities have been demonstrated for almost 200 species, with
   stable dimensions of responses (aggressive to fearful; shy to bold)
   across contexts and with a heritable basis to these traits. As a
   long-lived and highly social species, elephants (Loxodonta africana)
   were expected to demonstrate complex dimensions to individual
   characteristics or personalities, which would be obvious to human
   observers and validated by behavioral observations. We used
   principal-components analysis of ratings on 26 behavioral adjectives
   applied to one social unit, coded as the EB family, which has been
   observed for 38 years. Eleven adult females were rated by four observers
   and found to have individually variable traits on four dimensions
   described by principal-components analysis. The first component was
   associated with effective and confident family leadership. Component 2
   was age-related, and defined by playfulness, exploration and high levels
   of activity, suggesting both an experience and an age-related element to
   its structure. Component 3 represented gentleness and at its other
   extreme, aggression, and Component 4 was related to constancy
   (predictability and popularity), with both of these latter components
   reflecting social integration. Leadership among elephant females
   represents the successful negotiation among individual interests, and
   our components were related to a capacity to affect the behavior of
   others in the absence of aggressive dominance. The family matriarch,
   Echo, was high on elements associated with leadership. The importance of
   the matriarch in this family's success suggests that elements of
   personality may underlie interfamilial variation in long-term survival
   and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes or animal personalities may emerge due to
   covariation with different life-history strategies individual animals
   pursue, like risk-associated feeding rates translating in different
   growth trajectories. However, less clear is how this might affect
   individuals in cooperatively breeding species, where subordinates assist
   dominants in raising offspring, and growth has profound life-history and
   social consequences. Here, we examined the effects of behavioral type on
   growth rates and feeding in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher, comparing growth rates of individuals settled
   inside a group (dominant or subordinate) or unsettled fish (aggregation)
   of different behavioral types (bold-shy continuum) under a feeding
   regime where food could not be monopolized. Controlling for other
   factors, we found no effect of the behavioral type on the growth rates
   of dominants and subordinates in either sex. In contrast, bold female
   aggregation fish were significantly growing faster in length compared
   with shy female aggregation fish, whereas no such effect was detected in
   male aggregation fish. These growth rate differences were largely
   matched by differences in feeding rates, but locomotion appeared more
   important in determining growth than feeding rate. Our results show that
   differences in social status may need to be taken into account when
   testing for correlations between behavioral type and growth in
   vertebrates, and cautions that growth adjustments may get obscured due
   to correlated changes in other costly behaviors, like locomotion.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Increasing intensification in vineyards has detrimental effects on
   biodiversity. Although several studies addressed this topic, the
   reproductive outcomes of model organisms in vineyards received little
   attention.
   We carrie d out the first study on birds nesting in natural nests on
   vines, focusing on nest density, breeding performance and nest-site
   selection in organic and conventional systems and in two contrasting
   trellising systems, pergola (taller, with more spaced rows and a denser
   canopy) vs. spalliera.
   We surveyed 228 nests of six species and analysed nest densities and
   final fates as a function of vineyard management and trellising system
   by means of GLM(M)s.
   51\% of nests were abandoned before egg-laying and the probability of
   early abandonment was positively related to the amount of access farmers
   had for management activities. The number of nests was four times higher
   in pergola than in spalliera vineyards, likely due to pergola's complex
   and tree-like structure. Organic or conventional management did not
   affect nest density, probably due to reduced differences in terms of
   management practices between them. Breeding success was low and
   marginally affected by the interaction of the management and trellising
   systems, being higher in conventional pergola.
   Nests were preferentially built on larger vines and were placed at an
   increasing height on the vine as the season progressed. Nests built at
   greater heights had greater success.
   We provide some management recommendations for bird conservation in
   vineyards: promoting pergola and maintaining older vineyards, limiting
   grass mowing in April and May, and in compatibility with agricultural
   management, optimising the amount of farmers' access to vineyards. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding how and why consistent behavioural traits (i.e. animal
   personality) vary between individuals, and identifying the mechanisms
   that underlie such variation, is a key focus in behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology. In many animals, male and female behaviour often
   diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history
   trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies
   spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring
   the very strong possibility that key components of personality,
   behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between
   males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important
   role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity
   of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying
   the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate
   skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female
   delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural
   traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that
   explains the delicate skink's successful invasion history via accidental
   introductions. We found that females were more social than males and
   showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the
   same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable
   and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were
   consistently more active explored environments faster and were more
   likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of
   sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both
   sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study
   highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in
   personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade.
   Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often
   face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual's
   personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel
   environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females
   in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about
   the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion
   history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend
   towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive
   correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour
   suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome. Our
   results suggest limited behavioural variation between the sexes and that
   both sexes may have an equal invasion potential.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that living in groups helps animals avoid
   predation and locate resources, but maintaining a group requires
   collective coordination, which can be difficult when individuals differ
   from one another. Personality variation (consistent behavioural
   differences within a population) is already known to be important in
   group interactions. Growing evidence suggests that individuals also
   differ in their consistency, i.e. differing in how variable they are
   over time, and theoretical models predict that this consistency can be
   beneficial in social contexts. We used three-spined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to test whether the consistency in, as well as
   average levels of, risk taking behaviour (i.e. boldness) when
   individuals were tested alone affects social interactions when fish were
   retested in groups of 2 and 4. Behavioural consistency, independently of
   average levels of risk-taking, can be advantageous: more consistent
   individuals showed higher rates of initiating group movements as
   leaders, more behavioural coordination by joining others as followers,
   and greater food consumption. Our results have implications for both
   group decision making, as groups composed of consistent individuals are
   more cohesive, and personality traits, as social interactions can have
   functional consequences for consistency in behaviour and hence the
   evolution of personality variation.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization has caused significant behavioural modifications in wild
   animals. Change in anti-predator behaviour is the most widespread
   example across different taxa in urban areas, which is probably due to a
   decrease in predation pressure and habituation towards humans.
   Seasonality or phenology has also been modified by urbanization since
   some resources in urban environments are highly controlled, for example,
   artificial feeding. Under natural conditions, anti-predator responses
   vary with seasonal variability in environmental and individual
   conditions. However, resource stability possibly reduces the seasonality
   of anti-predator behaviours in urban animals. Here, we compare the
   seasonal difference of flight initiation distance (FID), a measurement
   of anti-predator response, in Eurasian red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris
   between urban and rural areas in the Tokachi region, Hokkaido, Japan.
   Rural squirrels possessed FIDs two to three times longer than those of
   urban squirrels. We also found squirrels in rural areas lowered FID in
   autumn, but no seasonal difference was observed in urban squirrels. Our
   results suggest that continuous supplementary feeding may have buffered
   the seasonality in anti-predator response. In addition, strong
   habituation to humans may allow urban red squirrels to correctly assess
   human activity as benign rather than reacting unnecessarily.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has seen lots of studies on animal personality' (i.e.
   the study of consistent between-individual behavioural differences). As
   timely and promising as this field is, its development has come with a
   diversity of research questions. As an unfortunate consequence, it now
   suffers from substantial confusion about what animal personality' is,
   and how relevant related research frameworks are. Here, we stress the
   current inconsistencies and sources of confusion pertaining to the
   field, and their consequences on terminology used and miscommunication
   between researchers. In an attempt to unravel and clarify the concepts
   underlying the field, we identify two distinct, but complementary,
   theory-driven conceptual frameworks: the intra-individual variability
   (IIV) approach and the life-history (LH) approach, which we believe
   encompass the vast majority of existing personality studies'. Finally,
   we argue in favour of theory-driven studies of consistent behavioural
   differences and state that the integrative statistical properties of
   random regression models should not override the merit of alternative
   conceptual frameworks. We then provide brief guidelines and warnings for
   a parsimonious and sound use of terminology.}},

Abstract = {{The African sharptooth catfish Clarias gariepinus has bimodal
   respiration, it has a suprabranchial air-breathing organ alongside
   substantial gills. We used automated bimodal respirometry to reveal that
   undisturbed juvenile catfish (N=29) breathed air continuously in
   normoxia, with a marked diurnal cycle. Air breathing and routine
   metabolic rate (RMR) increased in darkness when, in the wild, this
   nocturnal predator forages. Aquatic hypoxia (20\% air saturation)
   greatly increased overall reliance on air breathing. We investigated
   whether two measures of risk taking to breathe air, namely absolute
   rates of aerial O-2 uptake ((M) over dotO(2), air) and the percentage of
   RMR obtained from air (\% (M) over dotO(2), air), were influenced by
   individual standard metabolic rate (SMR) and boldness. In particular,
   whether any influence varied with resource availability (normoxia versus
   hypoxia) or relative fear of predation (day versus night). Individual
   SMR, derived from respirometry, had an overall positive influence on (M)
   over dotO(2), air across all contexts but a positive influence on \% (M)
   over dotO(2), air only in hypoxia. Thus, a pervasive effect of SMR on
   air breathing became most acute in hypoxia, when individuals with higher
   O-2 demand took proportionally more risks. Boldness was estimated as
   time required to resume air breathing after a fearful stimulus in
   daylight normoxia (T-res). Although T-res had no overall influence on
   (M) over dotO(2), air or \% (M) over dotO(2), air, there was a negative
   relationship between Tres and \% (M) over dotO(2), air in daylight, in
   normoxia and hypoxia. There were two Tres response groups, `bold'
   phenotypes with Tres below 75 min (N= 13) which, in daylight, breathed
   proportionally more air than `shy' phenotypes with Tres above 115 min
   (N= 16). Therefore, individual boldness influenced air breathing when
   fear of predation was high. Thus, individual energy demand and
   personality did not have parallel influences on the emergent tendency to
   take risks to obtain a resource; their influences varied in strength
   with context.}},

Title = {{Consistency in European seabass coping styles: A life-history approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{74-88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a growth of interest in the consistent
   differences in individual behaviour over time and contexts constituting
   the so-called ``individual coping styles{''}. An understanding of this
   inter-individual variation is essential to improve our knowledge of the
   adaptive value of behaviour. Coping styles may have implications in
   diverse fields, so the development of appropriate screening methods for
   each species appears to be the most effective way to extend our
   knowledge and to incorporate behavioural responses into selection-based
   breeding programmes, to improve the domestication and welfare of farmed
   fish. We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least
   twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation,
   aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and
   group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping
   style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The
   results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and
   between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and
   species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact.
   By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and
   hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and
   long-term). These tests therefore appeared to be the most relevant for
   the characterisation of coping style in European seabass. Furthermore,
   the results of these tests were also predictive of cortisol stress
   response. These tests are simple to perform and can be used to screen
   large numbers of fish, the first step in selection programmes including
   behavioural profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The behavioural trait axes of activity, exploration, boldness and
   sociability can help to understand the tendency of an invasive species
   to disperse, as may be expected at the fringe of an invasive population,
   or to socialise, as may be expected in well-established populations
   where densities of invaders are typically high. We compared behavioural
   traits between the gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus pulex
   from centre and fringe populations at Barton Broad, Norfolk, UK.
   Dikerogammarus villosus is invasive in Western Europe and has displaced
   many macroinvertebrate species, including the native G. pulex. Gammarus
   pulex is itself invasive in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, thus
   its displacement increases interest into what unique characteristics of
   D. villosus make it a dominantly successful invader. Dikerogammarus
   villosus was significantly less active, less explorative, and more
   social than G. pulex. We found no significant differences in the
   behaviours of D. villosus individuals from the central population and
   the invasive fringe. These patterns indicate active dispersal is likely
   important to the invasion success of G. pulex, while D. villosus might
   depend on passive movement. Our data suggest that behavioural factors
   determining invasive success within closely related taxa can differ
   considerably, and may lead to different patterns of invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences within (animal personality) and across
   (behavioural syndrome) behaviours became well recognized during the past
   decade. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the evolutionary and
   developmental mechanisms behind the phenomena is still incomplete. Here,
   we explored if risk-taking and exploration were consistent and linked to
   different ecologically relevant traits in wild-caught adult male
   European green lizards (Lacerta viridis) and in their 2-3 weeks old
   laboratory-reared offspring. Both adults and juveniles displayed animal
   personality, consistency being higher in juveniles. We found correlation
   between risk-taking and exploration (suggestive of a behavioural
   syndrome) only in adults. Juveniles were more explorative than adults.
   Large or ectoparasite-free adult males were more explorative than small
   or parasitized males. Juvenile females tended to be more risk-taking
   than males. Behaviour of fathers and their offspring did not correlate.
   We conclude that European green lizards show high behavioural
   consistency and age is an important determinant of its strength and
   links to traits likely affecting fitness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   variation in measures of life history and fitness, such as health and

   developed for studying great apes and other nonhuman primates, we
   obtained ratings on 116 wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei
   beringei) monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research
   Center in Rwanda. There were 8 raters who each had more than 1.5 years
   of working experience with the subjects. Principal component analyses
   identified 4 personality dimensions with high interrater
   reliabilities-Dominance, Openness, Sociability, and
   Proto-Agreeableness-that reflected personality features unique to
   gorillas and personality features shared with other hominoids. We next
   examined the associations of these dimensions with independently
   collected behavioral measures derived from long-term records. Predicted
   correlations were found between the personality dimensions and
   corresponding behaviors. For example, Dominance, Openness, Sociability,
   and Proto-Agreeableness were related to gorilla dominance strength, time
   spent playing, rates of approaches, and rates of interventions in
   intragroup conflicts, respectively. These findings enrich the
   comparative-evolutionary study of personality and provide insights into
   how species differences in personality are related to ecology, social

Abstract = {{The concept of ``coping styles{''}, or consistently different responses
   to stressors, is of broad interest in behavioral ecology and
   biomedicine. Two critical predictions of this concept are individual
   consistency of neurophysiological and behavioral responses (relative to
   population variability) and a negative relationship between
   aggression/proactivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
   reactivity. Recent studies failed to provide strong support for these
   predictions, especially outside of strictly controlled conditions, and
   long-term measures to test the first prediction are rare. Here, we
   demonstrate individual repeatability across 2-3 years of maximum
   circulating corticosterone concentration {[}CORT] and area under the
   {[}CORT] response curve (AUC(I)) during a standard capture-restraint
   test in wild, free-living adult Nazca boobies (Sula granti). We also
   show that the stress response predicts the personality traits aggression
   and anxiety in these birds (measured in the wild); however, the strength
   of these results was weak. Maximum {[}CORT] and AUC(I) showed higher
   repeatability between years than baseline {[}CORT]. After controlling
   breeding status, sex, mass, date sampled, and their interactions,
   baseline {[}CORT] was most closely related to personality traits,
   followed by AUC(I), and then maximum {[}CORT]. The direction of these
   relationships depended on whether the testing context was social or
   non-social. {[}CORT] parameters had little to no relationship with
   cross-context plasticity in personality traits. Our results generally
   affirm two critical predictions of coping styles, but match the emerging
   trend that these relationships are weak in the wild, and may depend on
   testing context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{44-53}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Canine personality is of keen interest to dog owners and researchers
   alike. The regular human contact with them makes dogs an ideal species
   to use in the investigation of animal personality. This study
   specifically focused on Labrador Retrievers, consistently one of the
   most popular breeds both in the UK and around the world. Using surveys
   completed by dog owners, data was gathered on the behaviour of the dogs,
   in addition to the physical characteristics and management
   characteristics of the dogs (n = 1978). Twelve personality traits were
   identified and investigated for associations with the demographic data.
   It was found that the working status of the dog was more commonly
   associated with differences in personality than other analyzed factors.
   Gundogs had higher scores for `fetching tendency' and `trainability'
   than Showdogs or Pets (P < 0.05). Chocolate dogs were more `agitated
   when ignored' and showed more `excitability' than black dogs, and lower
   `trainability' and `noise fear' than both yellow and black dogs (all P <
   0.05). Dogs exercised for longer periods showed less aggression, less
   fear of humans and objects and lower separation anxiety than dogs that
   were not as active. The effects observed in this study may be due to the
   experience and training of the dogs, the work-related genetic strain of
   Labrador Retriever or most likely, a combination of both influences. (C)

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Non-human animal personality is defined as consistent behavioural
   differences across time and situations/contexts. Behaviours are,
   however, often plastic and to explain how plasticity and personality may
   coexist an adaptive framework has been developed. Still, there is little
   information on how personality is impacted by situations and contexts on
   an individual level. We investigated this in the European mink (Mustela
   lutreola) by performing a set of five experiments in two situations
   consisting of non-breeding and breeding season, and by using different
   test contexts. Three personality trait domains were identified;
   boldness, exploration and sociability. The levels of boldness and
   exploration changed between seasons but remained repeatable, which
   implies behavioural reaction norms and supports that the concept of
   personality remained applicable despite plasticity. Whilst males became
   bolder and more explorative in the breeding season females became shyer,
   which reflects European mink breeding behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours
   performed in mirror stimulus tests fell into different domains depending
   on whether, the test was conducted in the own territory or not,
   suggesting plasticity in the response towards conspecifics. To conclude,
   our results highlight the importance of situation and context for the
   expression of personality, and the significance of measuring multiple
   personality trait domains with several methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1041-1047}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Individuals often differ from each other in how they respond to
   environmental events: a feature of behaviour often termed animal
   personality. Furthermore, animals often show unpredictability in how
   much they respond to these events over time leading to the suggestion
   that personality and intraindividual variability (IIV) might have
   important fitness consequences. We investigated this hypothesis by
   focusing on the tendency for individually identifiable male fallow deer,
   Dama dama, to escalate low-level (noncontact) agonistic interactions to
   fighting during the rut. Males differed in their tendency to escalate
   noncontact interactions to fighting; however, repeatability in
   escalation rates was unstable over the rut suggesting that escalation
   rate is a poor measure of personality. There was no difference in the
   level of IIV in escalation rate shown by males. A comparison of IIV
   recorded over two consecutive annual ruts showed that IIV was highly
   correlated between years; therefore, over an extended time period
   individuals were consistent in their willingness to engage in fighting.
   There was a nonlinear relationship between IIV and mating success;
   specifically, individuals that showed either low or high IIV in
   escalation rate had lower mating success than individuals that showed
   intermediate levels of IIV. Aggression and the willingness to commit to
   fighting are important fitness correlates; nevertheless, our
   understanding of how personality and IIV are related to aggression is
   poorly understood. This study shows that although escalation rate
   appears to be a poor measure of personality in the fallow deer, IIV is
   related to increased fitness in individuals that show intermediate
   levels of predictability in their willingness to fight over the rut. (C)

Abstract = {{Research in animal personality has been increasing over the last decade,
   as scientists realize its importance to health outcomes. In particular,
   personality has sometimes been used, in conjunction with other tools,
   for aspects of captive management, including decreasing stress,
   increasing positive health outcomes, successful breeding, and infant
   survival. A few such studies have focused on felids, and have shown that
   there are possible applications for personality in that taxon. This
   study looked at the Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia), a
   critically endangered species, with only an estimated 400 left in the
   wild. Raters assessed 25 Scottish wildcats on 42 traits and on a
   subjective well-being questionnaire. Mean inter-rater reliability on the
   personality items was 0.59 and 0.53 on the subjective well-being items.
   Three personality components were found using principal-components
   analysis: Dominance, Agreeableness, and Self Control. Higher Self
   Control was related to higher subjective well-being (r = 0.67, P <
   0.01). Implications for the results of this and other similar studies

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{179-185}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Positive reinforcement training (hereafter known as training) has
   increasingly been adopted in zoos, to facilitate complex veterinary
   procedures without sedation or restraint and support husbandry
   requirements. However, empirical studies to establish the efficacy of
   training or investigate its impact on keeper-animal relationships are
   scarce; this was the topic of the current investigation. Study animals
   were classified as formally trained (FT) partially trained (PT) or
   untrained (UT). Eight black rhinoceros (2FT, 2PT \& 4UT), twelve
   Sulawesi crested black macaques (4FT, 4PT \& 4UT) and eleven Chapman
   zebra (4FT, 2PT \& 5UT) were studied in 6 zoos across the UK and USA.
   Subtle cues and commands provided by keepers directed towards the
   animals were identified and the latency between these and the respective
   behavioural responses (cue-response) were recorded. Animal personalities
   were also assessed using trait ratings completed by keepers for each
   animal. Social species (zebra and macaques) responded quicker to cues
   than the solitary species (rhino; F-2 = 13.716, p < 0.001). FT animals
   responded quicker to keeper cues than PT and UT animals (F-2,F-22=
   6.131, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the
   cue-response latencies according to personality traits (Z = -1.576, p >
   0.05). Data suggested that trained group living animals had reduced
   latencies when reacting to keeper's cues, regardless of their
   personality. If we consider short cue-response latencies to be
   indicative of low fear, then we suggest that training can potentially
   reduce animals' fear of humans thus could contribute to positive
   keeper-animal relationships which in turn could lead to improved animal
   welfare. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been widely documented across a range of species.
   The concept of personality is composed of individual behavioural
   consistency across time and between situations, and also behavioural
   trait correlations known as behavioural syndromes. Whilst many studies
   have now investigated the stability of individual personality traits,
   few have analysed the stability over time of entire behavioural
   syndromes. Here we present data from a behavioural study of rock pool
   prawns. We show that prawns are temporally consistent in a range of
   behaviours, including activity, exploration and boldness, and also that
   a behavioural syndrome is evident in this population. We find
   correlations between many behavioural traits (activity, boldness,
   shoaling and exploration). In addition, behavioural syndrome structure
   was consistent over time. Finally, few studies have explicitly studied
   the role of sex differences in personality traits, behavioural
   consistency and syndrome structure. We report behavioural differences
   between male and female prawns but no differences in patterns of
   consistency. Our study adds to the growing literature on animal
   personality, and provides evidence showing that syndromes themselves can
   exhibit temporal consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals in most animal groups exhibit consistent behavioural
   differences across situations or over time known as behavioural
   syndromes. We conducted a study with a herd of young rangeland-raised
   cows to determine whether animals exhibited consistent differences in
   foraging behaviours across contexts (confinement vs. rangeland pasture)
   and could be clustered into behavioural type groups on the basis of a
   suite of correlated behaviours. We also investigated whether cows with
   different behavioural types performed differently in this environment.
   Supplement consumption rate (SCR) in confinement was used to select two
   groups of cows (fast eaters vs. slow eaters). This classification was
   validated by measuring the persistence of SCR differences through time,
   conducting cluster analysis to classify individuals into two behavioural
   types (BT1 and BT2) on the basis of a suite of 14 behavioural,
   physiological, and performance predictors, and comparing serum cortisol
   concentrations of cows in either group. Discriminant and linear
   correlation analyses were used to assess the influence of behavioural
   and performance responses on the classification of cows, and to study
   the relationships between behaviour and animal performance. Thirty-three
   young cows were tracked with GPS collars for approximately 45 days
   during the calving seasons 01 2006 and 2007 and several performance
   responses were measured on each individual. Cows classified as
   exhibiting BT1 had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) SCR (mean +/- SE
   2006: 1.90 +/- 0.1; 2007: 2.54 +/- 0.1 g/s) and serum cortisol (SC)
   concentrations (8.8 +/- 0.88 ng/mL) than BT2 counterparts (SCR 2006:
   0.32 +/- 0.03 g/s; SCR 2007: 1.59 +/- 0.1 g/s; SC: 5.5 +/- 0.5 ng/mL).
   Compared to BT2 cows, BT1 individuals tended to spend less time at water
   (BT1 : 73 +/- 10; BT2: 172 +/- 16 min/day), cover larger areas (BT1, :
   21 +/- 0.3; BT2: 17 +/- 2 ha/day), and exhibit less concentrated search
   patterns (BT1: 264 +/- 8.9; BT2: 314 +/- 2 Gm travelled/(ha
   covered/day)). BT1 individuals tended to be heavier (BT1 : 434 +/- 7;
   BT2: 394 +/- 10 kg) and began gaining weight sooner after calving (BT1 :
   44 +/- 3; BT2: 69 +/- 6 days). Cows exhibiting BT1 were more abundant in
   the herd and appeared to perform better in the rangeland environment
   where we conducted the study. Further research is needed to determine
   the constraints imposed by this behavioural syndrome on animal
   performance in other feeding environments. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Many models of selection predict that populations will lose variation in
   traits that affect fitness. Nonetheless, phenotypic variation is
   commonly observed in natural populations. We tested the influences of
   competition and spatial heterogeneity on behavioral variation within and
   among populations of Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) and
   tested for the differential expression of trait correlations. We found
   that populations of D. merriami exhibited more aggression at sites with
   more competition. Contrary to theoretical predictions and empirical
   results in other systems, the sites with the greatest spatial
   heterogeneity and highest levels of competition did not exhibit the most
   behavioral variation among individuals. However, the greatest
   within-individual behavioral variability in boldness (response to cues
   of predator presence) was exhibited where spatial heterogeneity was
   highest. Aggression and boldness of D. merriami were highly repeatable,
   that is, individuals behaved in a consistent manner over time, and the
   two behaviors were also highly correlated. Interestingly, the strength
   of this correlation was greatest where the competitive community was
   least diverse. These findings add to increasing evidence that natural
   populations of animals exhibit patterns of behavioral covariance, or
   personality structure, and suggest that competitive variation may act to
   erode personality structure.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{In biparental systems, members of the same pair can vary substantially
   in the amount of parental care they provide to offspring. The extent of
   this asymmetry should depend on the relative costs and benefits of care.
   Individual variation in personality is likely to influence this
   trade-off, and hence is a promising candidate to explain differences in
   care. In addition, plasticity in parental care may also be associated
   with personality differences. Using exploration behaviour (EB) as a
   measure of personality, we investigated these possibilities using both
   natural and experimental data from a wild population of great tits
   (Parus major). Contrary to predictions, we found no association between
   EB and natural variation in provisioning behaviour. Nor was EB linked to
   responsiveness to experimentally increased brood demand. These results
   are initially surprising given substantial data from other studies
   suggesting personality should influence investment in parental care.
   However, they are consistent with a recent study showing selection on EB
   is weak and highly context-specific in the focal population. This
   emphasises the difficulty faced by personality studies attempting to
   make predictions based on previous work, given that personalities often
   vary among populations of the same species.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Animals show consistent individual variation in behaviour over time and
   across different situations, a phenomenon commonly termed personality.
   Personality studies are important because, if personality traits extend
   their influence across a wide range of situations, they may help to
   explain the paradoxical occurrence of nonoptimal behaviours. A
   paradigmatic example of nonoptimal behaviour is the striking lack of
   behavioural defences of some hosts of obligate avian brood parasites
   despite the evident costs they incur. Here we propose that the interplay
   between personality features expressed by hosts outside the nest and the
   specialized behaviours expressed by hosts in/or near the nests to deter
   avian brood parasites (i.e. nest defence, egg and nestling recognition
   and ejection) may affect the average level of host behavioural defences
   exhibited at the population level as well as the evolutionary dynamics
   of brood parasiteehost interactions. Differences in personality between
   hosts may relate to the observed variation in susceptibility to brood
   parasitism in a given population, as well as to the set of host
   defensive behaviours expressed in/or near the nests to prevent the costs
   of brood parasites. In addition, differences in parasite density might
   have different consequences for the fitness of different personality
   traits and might potentially explain intermediate tolerance to
   parasitism and even acceptance of parasitic eggs by hosts in populations
   exposed to low selection pressures by brood parasites. Future research
   should thus aim to identify how the different personality traits may
   relate to specialized host defences to explain the occurrence of
   apparent maladaptive host behaviours. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been extensively studied from a functional and
   evolutionary point of view. Less attention has been paid to the
   development of personality, its phenotypic plasticity, and the influence
   of manipulation of early environmental factors. Here we describe the
   effects of manipulating the sex ratio of the litter, at postnatal day
   (pnd) 3, in wild-type rats, on personality traits in adulthood. We
   measured the treatment effects on aggression, defensive burying, and
   open field behavior at pnd 90 and 120, as well as on their contextual
   generality, and stability over time (differential and structural
   consistency). Main effects of litter composition were found on open
   field behavior at pnd 120 but not on the other behaviors. Since
   correlations between behaviors changed over time irrespective of the
   specific treatment, whereas in previous studies on unmanipulated litters
   this was not the case we suggest that early handling may disrupt adult
   personality traits. Overall the data indicate that personality is less
   stable over time that often assumed, having both proximate and ultimate
   implications. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 53:

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{148}},

Pages = {{713-731}},
Abstract = {{Aggression often shows large inter-individual variation, but high
   intra-individual consistency. Although the physiological basis and
   direct costs of aggression are generally well known, less is known about
   the physiological costs such as increased oxidative stress (OS). This
   can occur via increased leakage of oxidants during high metabolic
   demands such as physical activity, or by hormones regulating both
   metabolism and aggression. Here we address this within a natural
   population of White's skinks, Egernia whitii; a species in which both
   sexes exhibit consistent aggressive phenotypes, and sex-specific
   associations between testosterone and aggression. The results reveal
   that males' aggressive phenotype, independent of testosterone, was
   positively associated with antioxidant capacity (OXY), while there was
   no significant association in females. Oxidative damage (ROM) and
   oxidative stress index (OI), were not influenced by aggressive phenotype
   or testosterone, but showed borderline positive associations with body
   size (i.e., age). The results failed to show that high testosterone
   increases OS. Instead, OS may be related to sex-specific behavioural
   patterns associated with aggressive phenotype such as territory and mate
   acquisition. Although experimental work is needed to identify the causal
   links for these patterns, the results highlight the need to consider
   proximate mechanisms to understand constraints on phenotypic variation.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Change in behaviour is usually the first response to human-induced
   environmental change and key for determining whether a species adapts to
   environmental change or becomes maladapted. Thus, understanding the
   behavioural response to human-induced changes is crucial in the
   interplay between ecology, evolution, conservation and management. Yet
   the behavioural response to fishing activities has been largely ignored.
   We review studies contrasting how fish behaviour affects catch by
   passive (e.g., long lines, angling) versus active gears (e.g., trawls,
   seines). We show that fishing not only targets certain behaviours, but
   it leads to a multitrait response including behavioural, physiological
   and life-history traits with population, community and ecosystem
   consequences. Fisheries-driven change (plastic or evolutionary) of fish
   behaviour and its correlated traits could impact fish populations well
   beyond their survival per se, affecting predation risk, foraging
   behaviour, dispersal, parental care, etc., and hence numerous ecological
   issues including population dynamics and trophic cascades. In
   particular, we discuss implications of behavioural responses to fishing
   for fisheries management and population resilience. More research on
   these topics, however, is needed to draw general conclusions, and we
   suggest fruitful directions for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The social niche specialization hypothesis predicts that animal
   personalities emerge as a result of individuals occupying different
   social niches within a group. Here we track individual personality and
   performance and collective performance among groups of social spiders
   where we manipulated the familiarity of the group members. We show that
   individual personalities, as measured by consistent individual
   differences in boldness behavior, strengthen with increasing familiarity
   and that these personalities can be disrupted by a change in group
   membership. Changing group membership negatively impacted both
   individual and group performance. Individuals in less familiar groups
   lost weight, and these groups were less successful at performing vital
   collective tasks. These results provide a mechanism for the evolution of
   stable social groups by demonstrating that social niche reestablishment
   carries a steep cost for both individuals and groups. Social niche
   specialization may therefore provide a potential first step on the path
   toward more organized social systems.}},

Abstract = {{Children vary in the extent to which their development is shaped by
   particular experiences (e.g. maltreatment, social support). This
   variation raises a question: Is there no single level of plasticity that
   maximizes biological fitness? One influential hypothesis states that
   when different levels of plasticity are optimal in different
   environmental states and the environment fluctuates unpredictably,
   natural selection may favor parents producing offspring with varying
   levels of plasticity. The current article presents a mathematical model
   assessing the logic of this hypothesis - specifically, it examines what
   conditions are required for natural selection to favor parents to
   bet-hedge by varying their offspring's plasticity. Consistent with
   existing theory from biology, results show that between-individual
   variation in plasticity cannot evolve when the environment only varies
   across space. If, however, the environment varies across time, selection
   can favor differential plasticity, provided fitness effects are large
   (i.e. variation in individuals' plasticity is correlated with
   substantial variation in fitness). Our model also generates a novel
   restriction: Differential plasticity only evolves when the cost of being
   mismatched to the environment exceeds the benefits of being well
   matched. Based on mechanistic considerations, we argue that bet-hedging
   by varying offspring plasticity, if it were to evolve, would be more
   likely instantiated via epigenetic mechanisms (e.g. pre- or postnatal
   developmental programming) than genetic ones (e.g. mating with
   genetically diverse partners). Our model suggests novel avenues for
   testing the bet-hedging hypothesis of differential plasticity, including
   empirical predictions and relevant measures. We also discuss several
   ways in which future work might extend our model.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate relationships between
   animal personality (i.e., consistency in behavioral responses, also
   called temperament) and milk production in dairy cows. There has
   recently been a growing research interest in animal personality, which
   in production animals can have an important impact on welfare and
   production potential. Despite this, the relationship between personality
   and milk production in dairy cows remains unclear. Here we investigate
   links between behavioral responses during milking and in personality
   tests (responses to novel object and social isolation) with milk
   production in 2 breeds of dairy cattle, Swedish Red and White and
   Holstein. The milk production parameters investigated were
   energy-corrected milk (in kg) for the cows' first lactation and
   energy-corrected milk for their current lactation. Overall, cows that
   stepped more during milking or spent more time facing the herd during
   social isolation produced less milk in their first lactation. Cows that
   vocalized more during isolation had a lower current milk production.
   Variation in other behavioral responses showed limited relationships
   with milk production. Taken together, our results support a relationship
   between behavioral responses and milk production, where cows showing
   signs of nervousness produce less milk. However, observed relationships
   are dependent on the milk measure used, behavior, and breed
   investigated, supporting that the relationship between behavior and
   production traits is not straightforward.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Behaviors are highly plastic and one aspect of this plasticity is
   behavioral changes over age. The presence of age-related plasticity in
   behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in
   age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and
   genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for
   quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an
   important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of
   plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability
   (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are
   predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the
   theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely
   to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of
   the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We
   present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of
   individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between
   behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic
   level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a
   process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we
   throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory
   of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it
   presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of
   study in many systems. Empirical work aimed at understanding IxA and GxA
   in behavior is needed in order to understand whether patterns predicted
   by theory on plasticity indeed occur for age-related plasticity of
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge continues to emerge on how maternally derived egg hormones
   influence progeny behaviour in oviparous taxa. Of particular interest is
   how glucocorticoids (GCs) in eggs, as a signal of maternal stress,
   affect offspring behavioural traits. To date, research has focused on
   effects of egg GCs on offspring behaviours within a single experimental
   context. Little is known regarding how egg GCs affect relationships
   among behaviours and across ecological contexts (i.e. behavioural
   syndromes). We explored how exogenously increased egg cortisol shapes
   behavioural syndromes of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch.
   Social dominance during a territory intrusion and boldness following a
   simulated predator attack were recorded for juvenile coho salmon reared
   from cortisol-treated and untreated eggs. When exposed to a conspecific
   intruder, coho salmon treated with cortisol in ovo increased dominance
   behaviours, whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced these
   behaviours. Following exposure to a simulated predator attack, coho
   salmon reared from cortisol-treated eggs increased boldness (i.e.
   increased activity and feeding; reduced shelter use), whereas coho
   salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced boldness. A dominance-boldness
   relationship was observed for coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated,
   but not untreated, eggs; dominance during the territory intrusion
   positively correlated with boldness under threat of predation. Our
   results highlight the complex influence of egg GCs on offspring
   behaviour and behavioural syndromes. Continued investigation into the
   outcomes of egg GCs on offspring will broaden our understanding of
   intergenerational components of the hormone-behaviour nexus. (C) 2015

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, i.e. stable individual differences in behaviour, is
   considered to be subject to evolutionary processes, as it has been shown
   to be heritable and to entail fitness consequences. Different hypotheses
   have been developed to explain why personality variation is maintained
   within populations, most likely via processes of balancing selection.
   One mechanism discussed is that combinations of similar personalities
   within breeding pairs could increase fitness. We investigated this
   purported mechanism by studying the association between personality
   combinations within nulliparous pairs and their onset of reproduction in
   a monogamous rodent, the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. In
   seasonal iteroparous breeders, reproductive timing is relevant to
   fitness, as a delayed onset of breeding potentially limits the number of
   breeding occasions and lowers the chance that offspring will start
   reproducing during the same season. Repeated standardized tests carried
   out prior to pairing revealed consistent individual differences in
   subjects' behavioural responses with respect to anxiety and exploratory
   activity, indicating the existence of personality types. Within-pair
   similarity in anxiety levels affected the chance of reproduction: pairs
   with similar anxiety scores had a higher probability of breeding, and
   were quicker to start, during the observation period, independently of
   the scores of both partners of the pair. We propose that this
   association between `personality matching' and the onset of reproduction
   could have important life history consequences in this species and might
   be one of the mechanisms leading to the maintenance of personality
   variation within populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{In stream-spawning salmonid fishes there is a considerable variation in
   the timing of when fry leave the spawning nests and establish a feeding
   territory. The timing of emergence from spawning nests appears to be
   related to behavioural and physiological traits, e.g. early emerging
   fish are bolder and more aggressive. In the present study, emerging
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) alevins were sorted into three
   fractions: early, intermediate and late emerging. At the parr stage,
   behaviour, stress responses, hindbrain monoaminergic activity and
   forebrain gene expression were explored in fish from the early and late
   emerging fractions (first and last 25\%). The results show that when
   subjected to confinement stress, fish from the late emerging fraction
   respond with a larger activation of the brain serotonergic system than
   fish from the early fraction. Similarly, in late emerging fish, stress
   resulted in elevated expression of mRNA coding for serotonin 1A
   receptors (5-HT1A), GABA-A receptor-associated protein and ependymin,
   effects not observed in fish from the early emerging fraction. Moreover,
   fish from the early emerging fraction displayed bolder behaviour than
   their late emerging littermates. Taken together, these results suggest
   that time of emergence, boldness and aggression are linked to each
   other, forming a behavioural syndrome in juvenile salmon. Differences in
   brain gene expression between early and late emerging salmon add further
   support to a relationship between stress coping style and timing of
   emergence. However, early and late emerging salmon do not appear to
   differ in hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis reactivity,
   another characteristic of divergent stress coping styles.}},

Title = {{Evidence for a mechanism of phenotypic integration of behaviour and
   innate immunity in a wild rodent: implications for animal personality
   and ecological immunology}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{179-189}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{If a single mechanism influences multiple traits, it may facilitate
   functional integration or impede optimal trait expression to produce
   consistent individual differences and correlations among those traits.
   The fields of animal personality and ecological immunology each aim to
   understand variation and covariation of behavioural and immune traits.
   Studying these traits together may provide additional insight into
   patterns of (co)variation than studying behaviours or immunity in
   isolation, as trade-offs between behaviour and immunity are likely.
   Hormonal mechanisms may be involved in the variation and covariation
   between behavioural and immune traits, and the role of receptors in
   particular has rarely been tested in wild animals. In wild-caught
   Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, we delivered
   mifepristone to experimentally block the actions of glucocorticoid
   receptors (GRs), a component of the stress response. Then we evaluated
   whether cortisol binding with GRs affects the plasticity of behavioural
   and immune traits, consistent individual differences and phenotypic
   integration of exploratory behaviour, activity, antipredator behaviour,
   response to restraint and bacteria-killing ability, a measure of innate
   immunity. Mifepristone treatment abolished relationships between faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite levels and both exploratory behaviour and
   bacteria-killing ability. This result indicates that cortisol binding
   with GRs is a mechanism of plasticity of those traits. Mifepristone also
   affected relationships among traits. Specifically, mifepristone
   treatment significantly modulated the relationships between
   bacteria-killing ability and two behaviours, exploration and activity.
   This result supports the hypothesis that the GR-cortisol binding is a
   mechanism of phenotypic integration. Together, these results suggest
   that GR-cortisol binding balances the often observed trade-off between
   behaviour and immunity to produce patterns of (co)variation of
   behavioural and immune traits seen in nature. (C) 2015 The Association

Abstract = {{Studies are increasingly demonstrating that individuals differ in their
   rate of ageing, and this is postulated to emerge from a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction. Recent theory predicts a
   correlation between individual personality and life-history strategy,
   and from this comes the prediction that personality may predict the
   intensity of senescence. Here we show that boldness correlates with
   reproductive success and foraging behaviour in wandering albatrosses,
   with strong sex-specific differences. Shy males show a strong decline in
   reproductive performance with age, and bold females have lower
   reproductive success in later adulthood. In both sexes, bolder birds
   have longer foraging trips and gain more mass per trip as they get
   older. However, the benefit of this behaviour appears to differ between
   the sexes, such that it is only matched by high reproductive success in
   males. Together our results suggest that personality linked foraging
   adaptations with age are strongly sex-specific in their fitness benefits
   and that the impact of boldness on senescence is linked to ecological
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Predators attack and plants defend, so herbivores face the dilemma of
   how to eat enough without being eaten. But do differences in the
   personality of herbivores affect the foraging choices of individuals? We
   explored the ecological impact of personality in a generalist herbivore,
   the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). After quantifying
   personality traits in wild individuals brought temporarily into
   captivity, we tested how these traits altered foraging by individuals
   when free-ranging in their natural habitat. To measure their responses
   to the dual costs of predation risk and plant toxin, we varied the toxin
   concentration of food in safe foraging patches against paired, non-toxic
   risky patches, and used a novel synthesis of a manipulative
   Giving-Up-Density (GUD) experiment and video behavioural analysis. At
   the population level, the cost of safe patches pivoted around that of
   risky patches depending on food toxin concentration. At the individual
   level, boldness affected foraging at risky high-quality food patches (as
   behavioural differences between bold and shy), and at safe patches only
   when food toxin concentration was low (as differences in foraging
   outcome). Our results ecologically validate the personality trait of
   boldness, in brushtail possums. They also reveal, for the first time, a
   nuanced link between personality and the way in which individuals
   balance the costs of food and fear. Importantly, they suggest that high
   plant defence effectively attenuates differences in foraging behaviour
   arising from variation in personality, but poorly defended plants in
   safe areas should be differentially subject to herbivory depending on
   the personality of the herbivore.}},

Abstract = {{Only recently, variability within individuals has become of importance
   to evolutionary thinking. The boom in the literature on behavioural
   variability has led to the emergence of concepts such as behavioural
   plasticity, stereotypy, imprecision, and intra-individual variability
   (IIV). The proliferation of new terms has resulted in overlapping
   concepts, spreading confusion in understanding the origins of
   variability. Here we provide a critical overview of the concepts related
   to behavioural variability within the individual. We conclude that
   although there is no overlapping between behavioural plasticity and IIV,
   these concepts do overlap with stereotypy; they also face problems with
   ideas of abnormality and absence of function in stereotyped behaviour.
   We further provide a critical overview of the sometimes confusing
   relationship between (1) within individual variability, and (2)
   consistent variability across individuals (personality). We point out
   that personality is logically independent of both activational
   plasticity and IIV, because personality emerges at the population level,
   whereas plasticity and IIV emerge at the individual level. We conclude
   that, in personality studies, the failure to acknowledge the existence
   of either internal variability or consistent between-individual
   differences in internal variability will result in mixing different
   phenomena, and inhibit building unified accounts from heterogeneous
   databases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The relationship between DRD4 polymorphisms and phenotypic correlations

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that the genetic architecture of
   exploration behavior includes the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4). Such
   a link implies that the within-individual consistency in the same
   behavior has a genetic basis. Behavioral consistency is also prevalent
   in the form of between-individual correlation of functionally different
   behaviors; thus, the relationship between DRD4 polymorphism and
   exploration may also be manifested for other behaviors. Here, in a
   Hungarian population of the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, we
   investigate how males with distinct DRD4 genotypes differ in the
   consistent elements of their behavioral displays during the courtship
   period. In completely natural conditions, we assayed novelty avoidance,
   aggression and risk-taking, traits that were previously shown repeatable
   over time and correlate with each other, suggesting that they could have
   a common mechanistic basis. We identified two single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNP554 and SNP764) in the exon 3 of the DRD4 gene by
   sequencing a subsample, then we screened 202 individuals of both sexes
   for these SNPs. Focusing on the genotypic variation in courting males,
   we found that ``AC{''} heterozygote individuals at the SNP764 take lower
   risk than the most common ``AA{''} homozygotes (the ``CC{''} homozygotes
   were not represented in our subsample of males). We also found a
   considerable effect size for the relationship between SNP554
   polymorphism and novelty avoidance. Therefore, in addition to
   exploration, DRD4 polymorphisms may also be associated with the
   regulation of behaviors that may incur fear or stress. Moreover,
   polymorphisms at the two SNPs were not independent indicating a
   potential role for genetic constraints or another functional link, which
   may partially explain behavioral correlations.}},

   persistence are central to predicting the ecological effects of
   intraspecific behavioral variation. We surveyed individual refuge use of
   mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a
   trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and
   presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released
   these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the
   repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat,
   and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on
   average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited
   some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how
   tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation
   threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than
   large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use
   was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size,
   crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our
   results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey
   organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat
   should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a
   severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately
   important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual
   behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge
   use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be
   more repeatable over time.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms display an impressive array of defence strategies in nature.
   Inducible defences (changes in morphology and/or behaviour within a
   prey's lifetime) allow prey to decrease vulnerability to predators and
   avoid unnecessary costs of expression. Many studies report considerable
   interindividual variation in the degree to which inducible defences are
   expressed, yet what underlies this variation is poorly understood. Here,
   we show that individuals differing in a key personality trait also
   differ in the magnitude of morphological defence expression. Crucian
   carp showing risky behaviours (bold individuals) expressed a
   significantly greater morphological defence response when exposed to a
   natural enemy when compared with shy individuals. Furthermore, we show
   that fish of different personality types differ in their behavioural
   plasticity, with shy fish exhibiting greater absolute plasticity than
   bold fish. Our data suggest that individuals with bold personalities may
   be able to compensate for their risk-prone behavioural type by
   expressing enhanced morphological defences.}},
