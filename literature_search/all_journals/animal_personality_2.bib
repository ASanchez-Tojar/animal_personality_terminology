Abstract = {{There is much interest in studying animal personalities but considerable
   debate as to how to define and evaluate them. We assessed the utility of
   one proposed framework while studying personality in terrestrial hermit
   crabs (Coenobita clypeatus). We recorded the latency of individuals to
   emerge from their shells over multiple trials in four unique
   manipulations. We used the specific testing situations within these
   manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral
   consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same
   situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations
   between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs
   had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between
   behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these
   correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component
   analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors
   and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured
   behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general
   personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention
   must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods,
   and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

Abstract = {{Colour polymorphism is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrates and has
   often been linked with differences in behaviour such as aggression or
   boldness, behaviours that are often part of personality traits in
   monomorphic species. However, up to now, very few studies have looked
   whether colour morphs just differ in average behaviour or whether
   specific combinations of behaviours are favoured in relation to a
   particular morph therefore signalling personality traits. This was
   tested in the highly social and polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura
   gouldiae). Tests were performed in pairs of a red-headed and a
   black-headed individual of same sex and size but different age. Capture
   rank in the aviary as well as latency to feed beside a novel object
   (neophobia) and to approach and touch a novel object on a perch
   (neophilia) were measured. For neophobia and neophilia, ranks of
   latencies calculated across all individuals were used and general and
   within-pair comparisons were made. Neophobia and approach neophilia were
   consistent over time (2 similar to mo), and approach neophilia was
   positively correlated with capture rank and neophobia indicating that
   the behaviours are part of personality traits. Moreover, black-headed
   birds generally approached the novel object earlier than red-headed
   birds. Similarly, within pairs, black-headed birds were first to
   approach the novel object and were also captured first. Relative age
   (younger or older than the partner) was related to neophobia and tactile
   neophilia ranks; older birds reacted faster. The results indicate that
   colour morphs not only differ in average behaviour but that specific
   combinations of behaviours are related to colour morphs suggesting that
   head colours signal personality traits. Furthermore, depending on age
   individuals may have different roles in a social network.}},

Abstract = {{A number of short-lived, iteroparous animal species have small broods in
   the early breeding season and larger broods in later breeding season.
   Brood size affects not only offspring size, but as recent results
   suggest, may also affect offspring's temperament, hormonal status, and
   aggression as adults. Most populations of short-lived, iteroparous
   mammals fluctuate predictably over the season, with low densities in
   winter, increasing densities in summer and a population peak in late
   summer followed by a population breakdown. If animals live only through
   parts of the season, possibly such differences in density and hence also
   in social environments among seasons require different personality types
   to increase individual fitness. We present data on behavior of European
   rabbits from a field enclosure study. These data clearly show that
   aggressiveness is higher in young from smaller litters than in young
   from larger litters, and smaller litters are usually born during the
   early breeding season. Moreover, our data suggest that behavioral types
   of the young rabbits are stable over time, at least during their
   subadult life. We suggest, that changes in mean litter size over the
   course of the breeding season may not only be a product of mothers' age
   or food availability, but may also have an adaptive function by
   preparing offspring characteristics for adulthood in a social
   environment undergoing predictable density changes within the season.

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during development can have long-lasting
   effects on morphology, physiology and behaviour. In contrast to human
   personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences
   the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish,
   Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through
   time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable
   behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social
   conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in
   combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult.
   Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements
   and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest
   mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male.
   Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social
   treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or
   became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was
   not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular
   mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to
   females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult
   were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult
   female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that
   contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and
   that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects
   of the early environment. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioural syndromes have experienced rapid
   increase in interest in the last few years because of their possible
   role in the evolution of life histories. However, there is still a
   scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in
   behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In
   this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on
   the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the
   identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus
   arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of
   family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family)
   on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in
   two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm
   maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The
   study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was
   consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE
   corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed
   behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by
   the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and
   maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family.
   It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here
   is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further
   studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole
   personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the
   opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in
   more natural circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality research has become increasingly popular over the

   brief report describes the use of both the rating and coding methods to
   examine personality within a group of 10 Garnett's bushbabies (Otolemur

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that differences in life history may lead to
   consistent inter-individual variation in behavioural traits, so-called
   behavioural syndromes, animal personalities or temperaments.
   Consistencies of behaviours and behavioural syndromes have mainly been
   studied in non-cooperative species. Insights on the evolution of
   cooperation could be gained from studying individual differences in life
   histories and behavioural traits. Kin selection theory predicts that if
   an individual's reproductive ability is low, it had to aim at gaining
   inclusive fitness benefits by helping others. We tested this prediction
   in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, by
   assessing reproductive parameters of adults that had been tested earlier
   for aggressiveness and for their propensity to assist breeders when they
   had been young ('juveniles'). We found that juvenile aggression levels
   predicted the acceptance of a subordinate in the group when adult. Males
   which were aggressive as juveniles were significantly more likely to
   tolerate a subordinate in the group when compared with males which were
   peaceful as juveniles, whereas females which were more aggressive as
   juveniles tended to expel subordinates more often. Females produced
   significantly smaller clutches when paired to males which had helped
   more as a juvenile, despite the fact that adult males hardly provided
   direct brood care. There was no evidence that females with a high
   propensity to help when young, produced smaller clutches or eggs when
   adult, but they took longer to lay their first clutch when compared with
   females with a low propensity to help when young. These results suggest
   that variation in behavioural types might explain variation in
   cooperation, the extent of group-living and reproductive decisions.}},

   heritability estimates greater than 0.8, massive genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) have only been able to account for a very small
   proportion of this variation (Gudbjartsson et al. 2008). If it is so
   difficult to explain the genetics behind relatively `simple' traits, can
   we envision that it will at all be possible to find genes underlying
   complex behavioural traits in wild non-model organisms? Some notable
   examples suggest that this can indeed be a worthwhile endeavour.
   Recently, the circadian rhythm gene Clock has been associated with
   timing of breeding in a wild blue tit population (Johnsen et al. 2007;
   Liedvogel et al. 2009) and the Pgi gene to variation in dispersal and
   flight endurance in Glanville fritillary butterflies (Niitepold et al.
   2009). A promising candidate gene for influencing complex animal
   personality traits, also known as behavioural syndromes (Sih et al.
   2004), is the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene. Within the last decade,
   polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with variation in
   novelty seeking and exploration behaviour in a range of species, from
   humans to great tits (Schinka et al. 2002; Fidler et al. 2007). In this
   issue, Korsten et al. (2010) attempt to replicate this previously
   observed association in wild-living birds, and test for the generality
   of the association between DRD4 and personality across a number of
   European great tit populations.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, the assessment of nonhuman animal personality has included
   a variety of methods-from direct behavioral observations in a variety of
   test situations to assessments provided by animal caretakers or
   trainers. Careful observation of how animals in zoos interact with novel
   enrichment may provide reliable insight into their personality. This
   study sought to describe a process for evaluating whether different
   methods of assessing personality result in similar conclusions. The
   study exposed 4 giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park
   and Zoo Atlanta to 10 novel enrichment items and recorded their
   behavior. Keepers also rated each panda on 23 behavioral characteristics
   on a survey. The study obtained individual behavior profiles for each
   panda. Significant differences across individuals in both the novel
   enrichment trials and keeper surveys formed the basis for the profiles.
   These methods also provided some insight into differences between the
   sexes that-based on the natural history of giant pandas-are
   qualitatively similar to what would be expected. The study found some
   consistency between assessment methods. However, there is a need for
   further study to validate these measures in a larger sample of giant
   pandas.}},

Abstract = {{The shy-bold continuum is an axis of behavioural variation for some
   species, but the consequences of Shyness and boldness in antipredatory
   behaviour is unknown. Bold animals have the tendency to be predated
   First after release in comparison to shy animals, who naturally avoid
   the predators. Antipredatory training has been used to enhance the
   defence behaviours of naive animals by various researchers around the
   world. For greater rheas, Rhea americana (Linnaeus, 1758), this kind of
   study is pioneer. In this study we have investigated if there are
   relationships between personality and performance of greater rheas in
   antipredatory training. We also investigated if the training procedures
   influenced the behaviour of the birds when presented to novel objects.
   Fifteen zoo-borne greater rheas were Studied and 16 personality tests
   were run, being eight before the application of antipredator training,
   and eight after the training. We presented to the birds four novel
   objects (ball, box, bag and person) and recorded their behaviour and the
   distance of the birds in relation to the objects. Results showed that
   the birds behave boldly before training and shyly after it. The
   antipredator training modified significantly the behaviour of the rheas,
   making them more careful about novel situations. Personalities affected
   the behaviour of the birds during antipredator training. The study of
   the animal personalities can be an useful tool in reintroduction
   programs since it helps to choose the animals with the highest chance of
   survival to reintroduce.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals
   alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in
   `personality'evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the
   integration of `intrinsic state' and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones,
   energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed
   as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically
   or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis
   estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour
   attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that
   only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level
   associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our
   meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative
   and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone
   levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of
   among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was
   nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive
   explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual
   variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear,
   additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii)
   explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv)
   empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were
   inappropriate. Our meta-analysis highlights the importance of feedback
   between empiricists and theoreticians in the study of adaptive
   behavioural variation.}},

Abstract = {{For the past two decades, behavioural ecologists have documented
   consistent individual differences in behavioural traits within species
   and found evidence for animal ``personality{''}. It is only relatively
   recently, however, that increasing numbers of researchers have begun to
   investigate individual differences in cognitive ability within species.
   It has been suggested that cognitive test batteries may provide an ideal
   tool for this growing research endeavour. In fact, cognitive test
   batteries have now been used to examine the causes, consequences and
   underlying structure of cognitive performance within and between many
   species. In this review, we document the existing attempts to develop
   cognitive test batteries for non-human animals and review the claims
   that these studies have made in terms of the structure and evolution of
   cognition. We argue that our current test battery methods could be
   improved on multiple fronts, from the design of tasks, to the domains
   targeted and the species tested. Refining and optimising test battery
   design will provide many benefits. In future, we envisage that
   well-designed cognitive test batteries may provide answers to a range of
   exciting questions, including giving us greater insight into the
   evolution and structure of cognition.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{1. Current syndrome research focuses primarily on behaviour with few
   incorporating components of physiology. One such syndrome is the
   pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) which describes covariation between
   behaviour, metabolism, immunity, hormonal response, and life-history
   traits. Despite the strong effect temperature has on behaviour, thermal
   physiology has yet to be considered within this syndrome framework.
   2. We proposed the POLS to be extended to include a new dimension, the
   cold-hot axis. Under this premise, it is predicted that thermal
   physiology and behaviour would covary, whereby individual positioning
   along the thermal continuum would coincide with that of the behavioural
   continuum.
   3. This hypothesis was tested by measuring thermal traits of delicate
   skinks (Lampropholis delicata) and linking it to their behaviour.
   Principal components analysis and structural equation modelling were
   used to determine if traits were structured within the POLS and to
   characterize the direction of their interactions.
   4. Model results supported the inclusion of the cold-hot axis into the
   POLS and indicated that thermal physiology was the driver of this
   relationship, in that thermal traits either constrained or promoted
   activity, exploration, boldness and social behaviour.
   5. This study highlights the need to integrate thermal physiology within
   a syndrome framework.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{396-406}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{To date, most studies investigating the relationship between personality
   traits and fitness have focused on a single measure of fitness (such as
   survival) at a specific life stage. However, many personality traits
   likely have multiple effects on fitness, potentially operating across
   different functional contexts and stages of development. Here, we
   address the fitness consequences of boldness, under seminatural
   conditions, across life stages and functional contexts in largemouth
   bass (Micropterus salmoides). Specifically, we report the effect of
   boldness on (1) juvenile survivorship in an outdoor pond containing
   natural prey and predators and (2) adult reproductive success in three
   outdoor ponds across three reproductive seasons (years). Juvenile
   survival was negatively affected by boldness, with bolder juveniles
   having a lower probability of survival than shyer juveniles. In
   contrast, bolder adult male bass had greater reproductive success than
   their shyer male counterparts. Female reproductive success was not
   affected by boldness. These findings demonstrate that boldness can
   affect fitness differently across life stages. Further, boldness was
   highly consistent across years and significantly heritable, which
   suggests that boldness has a genetic component. Thus, our results
   support theory suggesting that fitness trade-offs across life stages may
   contribute to the maintenance of personality variation within
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits, defined as differences in the behavior of individual
   animals of the same species that are consistent over time and context,
   such as `boldness,' have been shown to be both heritable and be
   influenced by external factors, such as predation pressure. Currently,
   we know very little about the role that early environmental factors have
   upon personality. Thus, we investigated the impact of incubation
   temperature upon the boldness on an oviparous reptile, the bearded
   dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Eggs, from one clutch, were incubated at two
   different average temperatures within the normal range. After hatching
   the lizards were raised under the same environmental conditions. Novel
   object and novel environment tests were used to assess personality. Each
   test was repeated in both the short term and the long term. The results
   revealed that incubation temperature did impact upon `boldness' but only
   in the short term and suggests that, rather than influencing
   personality, incubation temperature may have an effect on the
   development of behavioral of oviparous reptiles at different stages
   across ontogeny.}},

Title = {{Early experience affects adult personality in the red junglefowl: A role
   for cognitive stimulation?}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite intense research efforts, biologists are still puzzled by the
   existence of animal personality. While recent studies support a link
   between cognition and personality, the directionality of this
   relationship still needs to be clarified. Early-life experiences can
   affect adult behaviour, and among these, cognitive stimulation has been
   suggested theoretically to influence personality. Yet, the influence of
   early cognitive stimulation has rarely been explored in empirical
   investigations of animal behaviour and personality. We investigated the
   effect of early cognitive stimulation on adult personality in the red
   junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To this end, we assessed adult behaviour
   across a number of personality assays and compared behaviour of
   individuals previously exposed to a series of learning tasks as chicks,
   with that of control individuals lacking this experience. We found that
   individuals exposed to early stimulation were, as adults, more vigilant
   and performed fewer escape attempts in personality assays. Other
   behaviours describing personality traits in the fowl were not affected.
   We conclude that our results support the hypothesis that early
   stimulation can affect aspects of adult behaviour and personality,
   suggesting a hitherto underappreciated causality link between cognition
   and personality. Future research should aim to confirm these findings
   and resolve their underlying dynamics and proximate mechanisms. (C) 2016

Title = {{Is there a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity
   for locomotion in bluegill sunfish?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},

Abstract = {{The concept of behavioural syndromes (i.e. correlations between
   behavioural traits) has provided an important framework for
   understanding individual variation in animal behaviour and its link to
   individual variation in physiology and life-history traits. The
   pace-of-life syndrome concept posits that behavioural, physiological and
   life-history traits coevolve in response to correlated selection
   pressures, and therefore predicts a positive correlation between
   boldness (i.e. exploration and risk taking) and metabolic capacity for
   locomotor performance in individuals. We tested for a pace-of-life
   syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity for locomotor activity
   in juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Individual fish were
   screened and classified as bold or shy using an established refuge
   emergence test. Subsequently, the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms of
   bold and shy individuals were quantified using respirometry and by
   measuring the metabolic by-products of white muscle anaerobic glycolysis
   following exhaustive exercise, respectively. Bold fish demonstrated 25\%
   greater metabolic scope for activity (i.e. aerobic capacity) than shy
   fish, which was attributable to a 15\% greater maximum metabolic rate.
   However, there was no significant difference in resting metabolic rate
   or anaerobic energy expenditure (i.e. anaerobic capacity) between bold
   and shy fish. These results partially support a pace-of-life syndrome
   linking boldness and aerobic metabolism in juvenile bluegill sunfish,
   but did not reveal a link between boldness and anaerobic metabolism. Our
   findings suggest that aerobic and anaerobic capacities may be subject to
   different selection pressures, and that physiological processes
   governing maximum anaerobic performance in fishes are independent from
   behavioural and physiological traits related to boldness. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The study of animal personality, defined as consistent inter-individual
   differences in correlated behavioral traits stable throughout time and/
   or contexts, has recently become one of the fastest growing areas in
   animal biology, with study species ranging from insects to non-human
   primates. The latter have, however, only occasionally been tested with
   standardized experiments. Instead their personality has usually been
   assessed using questionnaires. Therefore, this study aimed to test 21
   common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus) living in three family groups, in
   five different experiments, and their corresponding controls. We found
   that behavioral differences between our animals were not only consistent
   over time, but also across different contexts. Moreover, the consistent
   behaviors formed a construct of four major non-social personality
   components: Boldness-Shyness in Foraging, Boldness-Shyness in Predation,
   Stress-Activity, and Exploration-Avoidance. We found no sex or age
   differences in these components, but our results did reveal differences
   in Exploration-Avoidance between the three family groups. As social
   environment can have a large influence on behavior of individuals, our
   results may suggest group-level similarity in personality ( i.e.,
   ``group personality{''}) in common marmosets, a species living in highly
   cohesive social groups. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a growing body of literature reporting developmental changes in
   personality, few studies have adopted a lifetime perspective to study
   age-related changes in personality traits. Since most personality traits
   are heritable and linked with fitness, ontogenetic changes can have
   evolutionary implications. In this paper, we explore age-related changes
   in two behavioral responses to handling, both of which are heritable and
   associated with fitness, in wild blue tits. We find that one of these
   responses (handling aggression), which is positively correlated with
   fitness, declines with age. We show that this age-related decline is not
   due to selective disappearance, but occurs also within individuals,
   which confirms that this personality trait undergoes a senescent decline
   in the wild. We further find that individuals differ significantly in
   their rate of ageing but found no statistical support for the presence
   of genotype-age interactions on personality. Future research on
   personality would benefit from a more explicit lifetime perspective.
   Our study constitutes the first demonstration of a senescent decline in
   a personality trait and underlines the need for future research on
   personality to adopt a more explicit lifetime perspective. In addition,
   we provide an example of how to investigate age-related plasticity in
   behavior while dealing with typical issues arising from the use of
   longitudinal data, which will be of interest for behavioral ecologists.
   Finally, our approach is likely to stimulate research given its
   relevance for both our proximate and ultimate understanding of animal
   personality in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal societies rely on highly influential keystone individuals

   success, such keystone individuals have the potential to diminish group

   whether information quality (accurate or inaccurate) influences
   collective outcomes when keystone individuals are the first to acquire
   it. We trained keystone or generic individuals to attack or avoid novel
   stimuli and implanted these trained individuals within groups of naive
   colony-mates. We subsequently tracked how quickly groups learned about
   their environment in situations that matched (accurate information) or
   mismatched (inaccurate information) the training of the trained
   individual. We found that colonies with just one accurately informed
   individual were quicker to learn to attack a novel prey stimulus than
   colonies with no informed individuals. However, this effect was no more
   pronounced when the informed individual was a keystone individual. In
   contrast, keystones with inaccurate information had larger effects than
   generic individuals with identical information: groups containing
   keystones with inaccurate information took longer to learn to
   attack/avoidprey/predator stimuli and gained less weight than groups

Title = {{Variation at the DRD4 locus is associated with wariness and local site
   selection in urban black swans}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interactions between wildlife and humans are increasing.
   Urban animals are often less wary of humans than their non-urban
   counterparts, which could be explained by habituation, adaptation or
   local site selection. Under local site selection, individuals that are
   less tolerant of humans are less likely to settle in urban areas.
   However, there is little evidence for such temperament-based site
   selection, and even less is known about its underlying genetic basis. We
   tested whether site selection in urban and non-urban habitats by black
   swans (Cygnus atratus) was associated with polymorphisms in two genes
   linked to fear in animals, the dopamine receptor D-4 (DRD4) and
   serotonin transporter (SERT) genes.
   Results: Wariness in swans was highly repeatable between disturbance
   events (repeatability = 0.61) and non-urban swans initiated escape from
   humans earlier than urban swans. We found no inter-individual variation
   in the SERT gene, but identified five DRD4 genotypes and an association
   between DRD4 genotype and wariness. Individuals possessing the most
   common DRD4 genotype were less wary than individuals possessing rarer
   genotypes. As predicted by the local site selection hypothesis,
   genotypes associated with wary behaviour were over three times more
   frequent at the non-urban site. This resulted in moderate population
   differentiation at DRD4 (F-ST = 0.080), despite the sites being
   separated by only 30 km, a short distance for this highly-mobile
   species. Low population differentiation at neutrally-selected
   microsatellite loci and the likely occasional migration of swans between
   the populations reduces the likelihood of local site adaptations.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that wariness in swans is partly
   genetically-determined and that wary swans settle in less-disturbed
   areas. More generally, our findings suggest that site-specific
   management strategies may be necessary that consider the temperament of
   local animals.}},

Title = {{Personality tests predict responses to a spatial-learning task in

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{145-154}},

Abstract = {{Behaviours are the result of the interaction between genetic factors,
   past experiences, and labile environmental and social influences.
   Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than
   the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts.
   This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and
   is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness
   and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem
   to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore,
   personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the
   task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are
   expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better
   to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we
   report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a
   period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a
   spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both
   in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not
   differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower
   cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than
   slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds
   successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet,
   fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task,
   potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage
   earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with
   recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or
   proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the
   habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the
   reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the
   personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Flexibility in behavior is advantageous for organisms that transition
   between stages of a complex life history. However, various constraints
   can set limits on plasticity, giving rise to the existence of
   personalities that have associated costs and benefits. Here, we document
   a field and laboratory experiment that examines the consistency of
   measures of boldness, activity, and aggressive behavior in the young of
   a tropical reef fish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae)
   immediately following their transition between pelagic larval and
   benthic juvenile habitats. Newly-settled fish were observed in aquaria
   and in the field on replicated patches of natural habitat cleared of
   resident fishes. Seven behavioral traits representing aspects of
   boldness, activity and aggression were monitored directly and via video
   camera over short (minutes), medium (hours), and long (3 days) time
   scales. With the exception of aggression, these behaviors were found to
   be moderately or highly consistent over all time scales in both
   laboratory and field settings, implying that these fish show stable
   personalities within various settings. Our study is the first to examine
   the temporal constancy of behaviors in both field and laboratory
   settings in over various time scales at a critically important phase

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{43-49}},

Abstract = {{Despite the potential benefits of modifying behaviour according to
   changing ecological conditions, many populations comprise individuals
   that differ consistently in behaviour across situations, contexts and
   points in time (i.e. individuals show personality). If personalities are
   adaptive, the balance between consistency and flexibility of behavioural
   traits should reflect the ability of individuals to detect and respond
   to changing conditions in an appropriate and timely manner and, thus,
   depend upon the pace and predictability of changing conditions. We
   investigated the balance between individual consistency and flexibility
   in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus by assaying boldness across
   the diel cycle and correlating these data with patterns of prey and
   threat abundance in the natural habitat. We found significant diel
   flexibility in boldness correlating with drastic and predictable changes
   in prey availability. Moreover, the strength of within-individual
   flexibility in boldness was comparable to the strength of rank-order
   consistency among individuals. We also found evidence that mean boldness
   level and among-individual variation in boldness are correlated with
   reproductive status. These data emphasize the interplay between
   behavioural consistency and flexibility and suggest that temporal
   characteristics of ecological conditions may be vital in assessing the
   strength, stability and adaptive value of animal personalities. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The function of a network is affected by its structure. For example, the
   presence of highly interactive individuals, or hubs, influences the
   extent and rate of information spread across a network. In a network of
   interactions, the duration over which individual variation in
   interactions persists may affect how the network operates. Individuals
   may persist in their behavior over time and across situations, often
   referred to as personality. Colonies of social insects are an example of
   a biological system in which the structure of the coordinated networks
   of interacting workers may greatly influence information flow within the
   colony, and therefore its collective behavior. Here I investigate the
   effects of persistence in walking patterns on interaction networks using
   computer simulations that are parameterized using observed behavior of
   harvester ants. I examine how the duration of persistence in spatial
   behavior influences network structure. Furthermore, I explore how
   spatial features of the environment affect the relationship between
   persistent behavior and network structure. I show that as persistence
   increases, the skewness of the weighted degree distribution of the
   interaction network increases. However, this relationship holds only
   when ants are confined in a space with boundaries, but not when physical
   barriers are absent. These findings suggest that the influence of animal
   personalities on network structure and function depends on the
   environment in which the animals reside}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},

Abstract = {{Most studies carried out with seabass under self-feeding conditions
   report an intriguing social structure that is built around the device
   and the food dispenser with three coexisting triggering categories:
   high-triggering (HT), low-triggering(LT) and zero-triggering (ZT) fish.
   However, neither sex nor feeding motivation or hierarchy can explain the
   establishment of this specialization. We characterized the personality
   of seabass with the commonly used restraint and open field tests and
   assessed the link between personality traits and individual triggering
   activity towards the self-feeder apparatus. We found no differences
   between triggering categories during the restraint test but high
   triggering fish were characterized as shyer than low-and zero-triggering
   fish during the open field test. Triggering activity was negatively
   correlated with exploratory capacities and boldness. This experiment
   provides for the first time evidence that high triggering status in
   seabass is correlated with personality traits, which could partly
   explain the social structure that builds around a self-feeder device.

Abstract = {{The relationship between stress and personality has often been studied
   using captive animals in a laboratory context, yet less often in wild
   populations. Wild populations, however, may reveal aspects of the
   personality-stress relationship that laboratory-based studies cannot.
   Here, we assessed the personality and stress hormone response of adult
   females within a free-living population of Richardson's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus richardsonii). Personality was assessed by quantifying
   individual responses to a novel object, and physiological stress was
   measured from faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Principal component and
   principal component regression analyses were performed to determine
   whether the behavioural and endocrine measures were related. Based on
   these analyses, shyness-boldness was found to best predict
   glucocorticoid levels, in that individuals expressing the greatest
   vigilance in response to the novel object also had the highest measured
   concentrations of faecal glucocorticoids. Exploration, however, was
   independent of measured glucocorticoid levels, consistent with a
   multidimensional interpretation of non-human animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral ecologists are increasingly interested in patterns of
   repeatable variation in behaviors. The study of this variation, under
   the label `animal personality', frequently makes assumptions both in
   regards to what the ecological significance of particular behavioral
   responses might be and whether different methodologies in fact test the
   same behavior. Here, using house crickets (Acheta domesticus), we tested
   whether stereotypical approaches to quantifying repeatable variation in
   exploratory behavior measured the same behaviors. We found that house
   cricket exploratory behavior was highly repeatable in two populations
   (repeatability: 0.37-0.51). However, exploratory behavior across two
   different testing methods was not strongly correlated (r = -0.17 to
   0.14). This suggests that either different behaviors or distinct
   components of exploratory behavior were being measured. Our results also
   support recent criticisms that care needs to be taken in describing
   personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting species range-expansions and biological
   invasions is an important challenge in modern ecology because of rapidly

   imperative for dispersal success, a key stage in the invasion process.
   Here we investigate the composition and correlation of two important
   personality traits associated with invasion success, activity and
   boldness, and how they are connected to sex and individual size in a
   newly colonised population of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis
   in Lake Vanern, Sweden. We found no effect of sex or size on behavioral
   expressions of E. sinensis but a clear positive correlation between
   boldness and activity. In addition, this study generates important
   baseline data for monitoring behavioral development, and thereby
   changing ecological impact, of an invading population over time. This
   has implications for predicting ecological effects of invasive species
   as well as for managing ecological invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes have received much attention by behavioural
   ecologists in recent years. While the relationship between boldness
   across contexts and between boldness and aggression are frequently
   investigated, little is known about how these relationships might change
   because of environmental disturbances such as exposure to endocrine
   disrupters. 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) is an oestrogen mimic that
   is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide and has severe, negative
   impacts on the behaviour and physiology of exposed organisms. To assess
   how EE2 affects boldness and decision making, male Siamese fighting
   fish, Betta splendens, received repeated trials of three boldness assays
   (novel environment, empty tank and novel object) and one decision-making
   assay (a dummy male and female presented simultaneously) before and
   after exposure to acute, nominal doses of EE2. A control group of males
   received the same number of trials but was not exposed to EE2. When
   subjects were unexposed, a behavioural syndrome was found for boldness
   across contexts. In addition, boldness was positively correlated with
   aggression in the decision-making context. EE2 exposure disrupted this
   behavioural syndrome. In summary, EE2 exposure reduced overall
   behavioural response in all contexts, disrupted the behavioural syndrome
   and reduced behavioural consistency. Thus, even nominal, short-term
   exposure to EE2 can have dramatic effects on multiple levels of
   behaviour and potentially generate severe fitness consequences on
   exposed aquatic species. This study provides the first evidence of a
   boldnesseaggression syndrome in this species and demonstrates that
   pollution may negatively influence consistent individual differences in
   behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{Seasonal variation in the behaviour of a short-lived rodent}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Short lived, iteroparous animals in seasonal environments
   experience variable social and environmental conditions over their
   lifetime. Animals can be divided into those with a
   ``young-of-the-year{''} life history (YY, reproducing and dying in the
   summer of birth) and an ``overwinter{''} life history (OW, overwintering
   in a subadult state before reproducing next spring).
   We investigated how behavioural patterns across the population were
   affected by season and sex, and whether variation in behaviour reflects
   the variation in life history patterns of each season. Applications of
   pace-of-life (POL) theory would suggest that long-lived OW animals are
   shyer in order to increase survival, and YY are bolder in order to
   increase reproduction. Therefore, we expected that in winter and spring
   samples, when only OW can be sampled, the animals should be shyer than
   in summer and autumn, when both OW and YY animals can be sampled. We
   studied common vole (Microtus arvalis) populations, which express
   typical, intra-annual density fluctuation. We captured a total of 492
   voles at different months over 3 years and examined boldness and
   activity level with two standardised behavioural experiments.
   Results: Behavioural variables of the two tests were correlated with
   each other. Boldness, measured as short latencies in both tests, was
   extremely high in spring compared to other seasons. Activity level was
   highest in spring and summer, and higher in males than in females.
   Conclusion: Being bold in laboratory tests may translate into higher
   risk-taking in nature by being more mobile while seeking out partners or
   valuable territories. Possible explanations include asset-protection,
   with OW animals being rather old with low residual reproductive value in
   spring. Therefore, OW may take higher risks during this season.
   Offspring born in spring encounter a lower population density and may
   have higher reproductive value than offspring of later cohorts. A
   constant connection between life history and animal personality, as
   suggested by the POL theory, however, was not found. Nevertheless,
   correlations of traits suggest the existence of animal personalities. In
   conclusion, complex patterns of population dynamics, seasonal variation
   in life histories, and variability of behaviour due to asset-protection
   may cause complex seasonal behavioural dynamics in a population.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{One aspect of animal personality that has been well described in
   captivity, but received only little attention in studies in the wild, is
   that personality types may vary in their behavioural flexibility towards
   environmental changes. A fundamental factor underlying such differences
   is believed to be the degree to which individual behavior is guided by
   environmental stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in the wild using
   free-ranging great tits. Personality variation was quantified using
   exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, which has previously been
   shown to be repeatable and correlated with other behaviours in this and
   other populations of the same species. By temporarily removing food at
   feeding stations we examined whether birds with different personality
   differed in returning to visit empty feeders as this may provide
   information on how birds continue to sample their environment after a
   sudden change in conditions. In two summer experiments, we found that
   fast-exploring juveniles visited empty feeders less often compared to
   slow-exploring juveniles. In winter, sampling behaviour was sex
   dependent but not related to personality. In both seasons, we found that
   birds who sampled empty feeders more often were more likely to
   rediscover food after we again re-baited the feeding stations, but there
   was no effect of personality. Our results show that personality types
   may indeed differ in ways of collecting environmental information, which
   is consistent with the view of personalities as different styles of
   coping with environmental changes. The adaptive value of these
   alternative behavioural tactics, however, needs to be further explored.}},

   context, it turns out that some individual bumblebees (Bombus terrestris

   rewarding from punishing stimuli across modalities (visual or olfactory)
   or dimension (colour or shape) of the cues used. The size of the bees
   did not have a significant effect on the individuals' discrimination
   abilities but there was a significant difference between the two
   colonies tested. Bees therefore appeared to differ in their ability to
   discriminate between stimuli both individually and at the colony level.

Abstract = {{Recent work on animal personalities has demonstrated that individuals
   may show consistent behaviour across situations and contexts. These
   studies were often carried out in one location and/or during short time
   intervals. Many animals, however, migrate and spend their life in
   several geographically distinct locations, and they may either adopt
   behaviours specific to the local environment or keep consistent
   behaviours over ecologically distinct locations. Long-distance migratory
   species offer excellent opportunities to test whether the animals
   maintain their personalities over large geographical scale, although the
   practical difficulties associated with these studies have hampered such
   tests. Here, we demonstrate for the first time consistency in
   disturbance tolerance behaviour in a long-distance migratory bird, using
   the common crane Grus grus as an ecological model species. Cranes that
   hatched in undisturbed habitats in Finland choose undisturbed migratory
   stop-over sites in Hungary, 1300-2000 km away from their breeding
   ground. This is remarkable, because these sites are not only separated
   by large distances, they also differ ecologically: the breeding sites
   are wooded bogs and subarctic tundra, whereas the migratory stop-over
   sites are temperate zone alkaline grasslands. The significance of our
   study goes beyond evolutionary biology and behavioural ecology: local
   effects on behaviour may carry over large distances, and this hitherto
   hidden implication of habitat selection needs to be incorporated into
   conservation planning.}},

   behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different
   contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or
   nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context
   repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal
   individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or
   the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the
   tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits
   per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the
   across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except
   for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the
   context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could
   be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction
   towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies
   in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not
   included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are
   needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration
   propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and
   dispersal). (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Following recent arguments that there is no logical problem with
   attributing mental or agential states to animals, I address the
   epistemological problem of how to go about making accurate attributions.
   I suggest that there is a two-part general method for determining
   whether a psychological property can be accurately attributed to a
   member of another species: folk expert opinion and functionality. This
   method is based on well-known assessments used to attribute mental
   states to humans who are unable to self-ascribe due to an early stage of
   development or impairment, and can be used to describe social and
   emotional development as well as personality. I describe how instruments
   such as the Child Behavior Checklist, which relies on intersubjective
   expert opinion, could be modified to assess other species subjects. The
   measures are validated via the accuracy of the predictions that are
   derived, which is an example of the functionality of attribution. I
   respond to theoretical criticisms against use of this method, and argue
   that if the method counts as good science for infant cognition research,
   then it should count as good science for animal cognition research as
   well. Correspondingly, if the method doesn't count as good science for
   animal cognition research, then we must be very skeptical of its use
   with nonverbal humans.}},

Pages = {{69-79}},
Abstract = {{We have determined the extent to which individual responses of domestic
   cats on being handled by an unfamiliar person are stable between 2 and
   33 months of age. Twenty-nine household cats from nine litters were
   tested at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 33 months of age, by being held for 1 minute
   by a standard, unfamiliar person. Between 4 and 33 months of age,
   individual differences in the number of attempts made by the cat to
   escape, and in whether or not it showed signs of distress, were stable,
   with the partial exception of the test at 12 months. There was no
   consistency between tests in whether or not a particular cat purred. At
   2 months of age, the number of escape attempts was highest in cats which
   had been handled the least in the second month of life, but this trend
   was reversed in the number of escape attempts made at 4 months. The lack
   of distress exhibited by all cats in the test at 2 months indicated that
   all had received at least adequate socialization to people, and that
   none were therefore comparable with the unsocialized cats used in
   several previous studies. We conclude that under normal domestic
   conditions, the behavior of a cat when handled by an unfamiliar person
   reflects a stable character trait, and that extensive handling during
   the socialization period may be subsequently associated with a reduction
   in inhibited behavior when interacting with an unfamiliar person. (C)

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts associations
   between life history and `risky' behaviours. Individuals with `fast'
   lifestyles should develop faster, reproduce earlier, exhibit more
   risk-prone behaviours, and die sooner than those with `slow' lifestyles.
   While support for POLS has been equivocal to date, studies have relied
   on individual-level (phenotypic) patterns in which genetic trade-offs
   may be masked by environmental effects on phenotypes. We estimated
   genetic correlations between life history (development, lifespan, size)
   and risky behaviours (exploration, aggression) in a pedigreed population
   of Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Path analyses
   showed that behaviours mediated some genetic relationships between life
   history traits, though not those involved in trade-offs. Thus, while
   specific predictions of POLS theory were not supported, genetic
   integration of behaviour and life history was present. This implies a
   major role for risky behaviours in life history evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state
   (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation
   to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of
   starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta
   adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size
   during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is
   important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days,
   respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different
   combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL;
   first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively).
   Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the
   treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \%
   more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large
   within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for
   this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more
   actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration.
   Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being
   more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were
   positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied
   population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish
   two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive
   individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive
   individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct
   behavioral strategies early in life.
   This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in
   animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data
   suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is
   increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a
   limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On
   the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression,
   likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance.
   The experiment was carried out during the main population survival
   bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during
   this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited,
   and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our
   data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters,
   based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are
   positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and
   aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral
   strategy.}},

   highly repeatable individual differences in boldness and stress
   reactivity. Individual boldness scores were highly repeatable across
   four trials such that individuals that were the fastest to emerge in the
   first trial were also the fastest to emerge in subsequent trials.
   Additionally, individuals that were the most reactive to a handling
   stressor in the first trial were also the most reactive in a second
   trial. The strong link between boldness and stress response commonly
   found in teleosts was also evident in this study, providing evidence of
   proactive-reactive coping styles in H. portusjacksoni. These results
   demonstrate the presence of individual personality differences in sharks

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary change in one trait can elicit evolutionary changes in
   other traits due to genetic correlations. This constrains the
   independent evolution of traits and can lead to unpredicted ecological
   and evolutionary outcomes. Animals might frequently exhibit genetic
   associations among behavioural and morphological-physiological traits,
   because the physiological mechanisms behind animal personality can have
   broad multitrait effects and because many selective agents influence the
   evolution of multiple types of traits. However, we currently know little
   about genetic correlations between animal personalities and
   nonbehavioural traits. We tested for associations between personality,
   morphology and locomotor performance by comparing zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) collected from the wild and then selectively bred for either a
   proactive or reactive stress coping style ('bold' or `shy' phenotypes).
   Based on adaptive hypotheses of correlational selection in the wild, we
   predicted that artificial selection for boldness would produce
   correlated evolutionary responses of larger caudal regions and higher
   fast-start escape performance (and the opposite for shyness). After four
   to seven generations, morphology and locomotor performance differed
   between personality lines: bold zebrafish exhibited a larger caudal
   region and higher fast-start performance than fish in the shy line,
   matching predictions. Individual-level phenotypic correlations suggested
   that pleiotropy or physical gene linkage likely explained the correlated
   response of locomotor performance, while the correlated response of body
   shape may have reflected linkage disequilibrium, which is breaking down
   each generation in the laboratory. Our results indicate that evolution
   of personality can result in concomitant changes in morphology and
   whole-organism performance, and vice versa. (C) 2016 The Association for

   their responses change with experience with important predators,
   Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a
   mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much
   defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony
   defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience
   with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic
   composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals
   were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus,
   colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to
   experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally
   observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to
   determine which individual traits were associated with task
   participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology
   and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level,
   with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the
   attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making.
   Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting
   participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between
   colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence
   that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in
   situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively
   associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{While among-individual variation in behaviour, or personality, is common
   across taxa, its mechanistic underpinnings are poorly understood. The
   Pace of Life syndrome (POLS) provides one possible explanation for
   maintenance of personality differences. POLS predicts that metabolic
   differences will covary with behavioural variation, with high metabolism
   associated with risk prone behaviour and `faster' life histories (e.g.,
   high growth, early maturation). We used a repeated measures approach,
   assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test
   these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We
   found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and
   growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly
   faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support
   for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while
   personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do
   not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported.}},

Title = {{Intimidating courtship and sex differences in predation risk lead to

Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural correlations between mating behaviour and antipredator
   behaviour are expected when sexual behaviour increases predation risk.
   However, the correlation would be different between males and females,
   particularly when the sexes experience different levels of predation
   risk. Here, we tested this idea using a water strider species, Gerris
   gracilicornis (Heteroptera: Gerridae). G. gracilicornis males employ an
   unusual intimidating courtship strategy capitalizing on predator
   behaviours and female response to predators. Since mounted females are
   more vulnerable than males to predatory attacks from below, we predicted
   that changes in female mating behaviours across predation contexts
   (boldness in a mating context) should be associated with female
   antipredator behaviours (boldness in a nonmating context), but that the
   correlation would be weaker for male mating behaviours. In a series of
   behavioural assays, we measured water striders' (1) mating behaviour in
   the absence of predators, (2) mating behaviour in the presence of
   predation risk, (3) boldness in the mating context (changes in female
   mating behaviour after predator attacks) and (4) boldness in the
   nonmating context. We found that females behaved more cautiously around
   predators in both the mating and nonmating contexts. We also found that
   females' boldness in the mating context was significantly correlated
   with their boldness in the nonmating context. In contrast to females,
   antipredator behaviour of males in the nonmating context did not
   correlate with their boldness in the mating context. Thus we suggest
   that sex differences in boldness across predation contexts appear to
   cause sex-specific behavioural syndromes. (C) 2015 The Association for

Title = {{Personality and morphological traits affect pigeon survival from raptor
   attacks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits have recently been shown to impact fitness in
   different animal species, potentially making them similarly relevant
   drivers as morphological and life history traits along the evolutionary
   pathways of organisms. Predation is a major force of natural selection
   through its deterministic effects on individual survival, but how
   predation pressure has helped to shape personality trait selection,
   especially in free-ranging animals, remains poorly understood. We used
   high-precision GPS tracking to follow whole flocks of homing pigeons
   (Columba livia) with known personalities and morphology during homing
   flights where they were severely predated by raptors. This allowed us to
   determine how the personality and morphology traits of pigeons may
   affect their risk of being predated by raptors. Our survival model
   showed that individual pigeons, which were more tolerant to human
   approach, slower to escape from a confined environment, more resistant
   to human handling, with larger tarsi, and with lighter plumage, were
   more likely to be predated by raptors. We provide rare empirical
   evidence that the personality of prey influences their risk of being
   predated under free-ranging circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary: The interchangeable usage of the words
   ``personality{''}, ``temperament{''} and ``behavioral syndromes{''} in
   animal behavior research has often led to confusion. In this paper, we
   devise a framework for describing the behavioral phenomenon,
   betweenindividual/between-population variation, and between/across
   context variation. This framework can be used to give unique definitions
   of the three terms, supported by previous literature, giving clarity
   moving forward in the field of animal behavior.
   Abstract: Ethologists use a variety of terminology such as
   ``personality{''}, ``temperament{''} and `` behavioral syndromes{''}
   almost interchangeably to discuss the phenomenon of individuals within a
   population of animals consistently varying from one another in their
   behavioral responses to stimuli. This interchangeable usage of
   terminology has contributed to confusion within the field of animal
   behavior and limits the study of the phenomenon. Here we use a rapid,
   non-exhaustive and repeatable search strategy literature review to
   investigate where there were unique distinctions between these three
   terms and where there was an overlap in their usage. We identified three
   main areas of confusion in terminology: historical usage which is not
   updated; a lack of precision between different fields of study; and a
   lack of precision between different levels of variation. We propose a
   framework with which to understand and define the terms based on the
   levels of variation ethologists are interested in. Consistent individual
   animal behavioral variation relates to the different structures of
   variation of between-individual/between-population and between and
   across contexts. By formalizing this framework we provide clarity
   between the three terms which can be easily defined and understood.}},

Title = {{The backtest in pigs revisited - An analysis of intra-situational
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of different behavioural phenotypes in animals (regarding
   temperament and personality) has increasingly attracted the attention of
   scientists dealing with farm animal breeding, management and welfare. As
   part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how
   animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping
   strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993)
   suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature
   contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus,
   referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the
   backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency
   distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample
   of domestic piglets (n = 3555). By using a statistical resampling
   analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the
   behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping
   strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four
   times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26
   days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling
   attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal
   distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal
   distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably
   represents a unimodal distribution with a `ceiling-effect'. The
   intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation
   (r(S)) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r(S) = 0.19-0.45, p < 0.001;
   R = 0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural
   consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not
   show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not
   display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large
   pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural
   parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated
   backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that
   are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual
   dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum
   from active to passive coping behaviour. This means that individuals
   show both behavioural consistency and flexibility in behaviour. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent over
   time or across context are termed behavioural types or personalities.
   Social spiders are an emerging model for studying animal personality in
   social systems and our study was motivated by the lack of work examining
   the persistence of personality in the long-term and under changed
   conditions. We examined consistency and plasticity in two key
   behaviours, prey capture and web maintenance, and tested for the
   presence of a behavioural syndrome between them in the social spider,
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum. Our experiments over a large part of the adult
   life span show that not all spiders capture prey, suggesting behavioural
   consistency with implications for task differentiation. Through prey
   manipulation experiments, we further probed the role of hunger,
   proximity to prey, body weight and number of days into the experiment on
   individual propensity to capture prey. Our results demonstrate that
   under altered prey availability, responses of individuals are plastic
   and influenced by hunger. These results suggest that behavioural
   consistency can be modulated significantly by extrinsic factors. In
   contrast, we did not find consistent differences between individuals in
   their participation during web maintenance. Additionally, we did not
   find a behavioural syndrome. Together, these results suggest a scenario
   of quasi-specialisation in which there is no strict partitioning of
   tasks. For the first time, our results demonstrate behavioural
   consistency over extended periods of time in social spiders and have
   implications for colony efficiency and survival. We argue that studies
   spanning ecologically relevant time periods and environmental variation
   can reveal the full extent of behavioural consistency and flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in behavior have been
   demonstrated in an array of species from diverse taxa, and variation in
   boldness may be associated with variation in aggressiveness. However,
   little is known about how boldness is linked with the ability to win
   fights (resource holding potential) or about how the experience of
   fighting may alter subsequent boldness. Animal contests often involve
   role asymmetries, where the 2 opponents fight in different ways. Here,
   we investigate boldness before and after fighting in attacking and
   defending hermit crabs during contests over the ownership of gastropod
   shells. Although prefight boldness did not influence the chance of
   winning for attackers, successful defenders had longer startle responses
   (less bold) than those that gave up. Postfight changes in boldness also
   differed between roles. For defenders, there was a significant decline
   in consistency of startle responses after fighting, coupled with
   outcome-dependent plasticity in mean boldness. Furthermore, postfight
   boldness in defenders varied with the intensity of agonistic behavior
   inflicted on them by attackers. In contrast, boldness in attackers was
   stable across the before-and after-fighting situations. Links between
   internal state and agonistic behavior are known to vary between roles in
   asymmetric contests. It now appears that similar role-specific links are
   present between aggression and animal personality.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{150-157}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The existence of animal personality is well-established across a wide
   range of species, with the majority of evidence for this being obtained
   from individuals held in captivity. However, there has been little work
   assessing the influence of commonly-measured personality traits on
   fitness, which is pertinent when the genetic basis of personality is
   considered. We measured whether the reproductive behaviour and success
   of zebra finches in a captive mixed-sex aviary environment was
   influenced by an aspect of their personality, their exploratory
   behaviour in a single-sex social aviary. We found that more exploratory
   males made a greater number of breeding attempts and raised more
   nestlings than less exploratory males. These results were not confounded
   by extra-pair paternity, which was not related to personality, or by the
   individuals that did not initiate any reproductive attempts at all. Our
   work provides evidence that attributes of personality may influence the
   degree to which individuals cope with, and thrive in a captive
   environment and this should be accounted for in both experimental design
   and the interpretation of results. Furthermore, this suggests that there
   may be selection on these traits as part of the domestication process.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{The payoffs of an individual's behaviour vary with changing
   environmental conditions. Animals often modify their behaviours
   according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also
   retain consistent individual differences across environmental change
   (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often
   measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises
   the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of
   environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour
   persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an
   individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one
   environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a
   second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we
   experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and
   predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour
   of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that
   the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on
   antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along
   with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of
   squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as
   change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was
   repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging
   environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of
   behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals
   encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater
   environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour. (C) 2014 The

Title = {{Individual differences affect honest signalling in a songbird}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1775}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Research in the past decade has established the existence of consistent
   individual differences or `personality' in animals and their important
   role in many aspects of animal behaviour. At the same time, research on
   honest signalling of aggression has revealed that while some of the
   putative aggression signals are reliable, they are only imperfectly so.
   This study asks whether a significant portion of the variance in the
   aggression-signal regression may be explained by individual differences
   in signalling strategies. Using the well-studied aggressive signalling
   system of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), we carried out repeated
   assays to measure both aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling
   of territorial males. Through these assays, we found that aggressive
   behaviours and aggressive signalling were both highly repeatable, and
   moreover that aggressive behaviours in 2009-2010 predicted whether the
   birds would attack a taxidermic mount over a year later. Most
   significantly, we found that residual variation in signalling
   behaviours, after controlling for aggressive behaviour, was individually
   consistent, suggesting there may be a second personality trait
   determining the level of aggressive signalling. We term this potential
   personality trait `communicativeness' and discuss these results in the
   context of honest signalling theories and recent findings reporting
   prevalence of `under-signalling'.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality or temperament refers to individual differences in
   behaviour that are repeatable over time and across contexts. Personality
   has been linked to life-history traits, energetic traits and fitness,
   with implications for the evolution of behaviour. Personality has been
   quantified for a range of taxa (e. g., fish, songbirds, small mammals)
   but, so far, there has been little work on personality in bats, despite
   their diversity and potential as a model taxon for comparative studies.
   We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown
   bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a
   range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development
   influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values
   associated with activity would increase between newly volant,
   pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient
   YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past
   studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a
   24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a
   fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than
   younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that
   personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats. Thus, we
   found evidence of short-term consistency of personality within
   individuals but with the potential for temporal flexibility of traits,
   depending on age.}},

   predicts behaviour in horses}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{47-52}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective assessment of animal personality is typically time consuming,
   requiring the repeated measure of behavioural responses. By contrast,
   subjective assessment of personality allows information to be collected
   quickly by experienced caregivers. However, subjective assessment must
   predict behaviour to be valid. Comparisons of subjective assessments and
   behaviour have been made but often with methodological weaknesses and
   thus, limited success. Here we test the validity of a subjective
   assessment against a battery of behaviour tests in 146 horses (Equus
   caballus). Our first aim was to determine if subjective personality
   assessment could predict behaviour during behaviour testing. We made
   specific a priori predictions for how subjectively measured personality
   should relate to behaviour testing. We found that Extroversion predicted
   time to complete a handling test and refusal behaviour during this test.
   It also predicted minimum distance to a novel object. Neuroticism
   predicted how reactive an individual was to a sudden visual stimulus but
   not how quickly it recovered from this. Agreeableness did not predict
   any behaviour during testing. There were several unpredicted
   correlations between subjective measures and behaviour tests which we
   explore further. Our second aim was to combine data from the subjective
   assessment and behaviour tests to gain a more comprehensive
   understanding of personality. We found that the combination of methods
   provides new insights into horse behaviour. Furthermore, our data are
   consistent with the idea of horses showing different coping styles, a
   novel finding for this species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Personality, the presence of persistent behav105 ioral differences among
   individuals over time or contexts, potentially has important ecological
   and evolutionary consequences. However, a lack of knowledge about its
   genetic architecture limits our ability to understand its origin,
   evolution, and maintenance. Here, we report on a genome-wide
   quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for two personality traits,
   docility and boldness, in free-living female bighorn sheep from Ram
   Mountain, Alberta, Canada. Our variance component linkage analysis based
   on 238 microsatellite loci genotyped in 310 pedigreed individuals
   identified suggestive docility and boldness QTL on sheep chromosome 2
   and 6, respectively. A lack of QTL overlap indicated that genetic
   covariance between traits was not modulated by pleiotropic effects at a
   major locus and may instead result from linkage disequilibrium or
   pleiotropic effects at QTL of small effects. To our knowledge, this
   study represents the first attempt to dissect the genetic architecture
   of personality in a free-living wildlife population, an important step
   toward understanding the link between molecular genetic variation in
   personality and fitness and the evolutionary processes maintaining this
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{Regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997) builds on the classic
   approach-avoidance distinction by identifying two important approach
   orientations: the promotion focus (approaching gains and attainment) and
   the prevention focus (approaching nonlosses and safety). Though
   individual differences in regulatory focus have been widely studied in
   human psychology, it is unknown if such differences exist in other
   species. To explore this possibility, we designed a series of tests for
   laboratory rats, paralleling human regulatory focus research on risk
   taking. In home-cage tests, rats (N = 23) were given an opportunity to
   prevent a loss by burying a noxious novel object. In solitary tests in a
   novel enclosure, the same rats had the opportunity to pursue gains (food
   rewards) and/or safety (darkness). Rats demonstrated stable individual
   differences on both tests (p's < .001). Complementing the human
   research, duration of time spent with the noxious novel object was
   predicted by an individual's tendency to pursue safety (p < .01) and not
   by the tendency to pursue gains (p > .8). Some aspects of these results
   were compatible with alternative approaches, such as the bold-shy axis
   and ``if-then{''} personality profiles (Mischel \& Shoda, 1995).
   Regulatory focus theory, however, was uniquely able to predict the
   overall pattern, which may be an indication that it could contribute to
   future research in animal personality, motivation, and welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that
   may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually
   an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially
   generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may
   be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates
   or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been
   studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive
   propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in
   the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an
   established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four
   fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we
   analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible
   mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates)
   according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression
   levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural
   idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant
   position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social
   interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected
   by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this
   experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating
   effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types
   and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies
   this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social
   contexts, especially in highly social species. (C) 2012 The Association

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, repeatable behaviour through time and across
   contexts, is ecologically and evolutionarily important as it can account
   for the exhibition of sub-optimal behaviours. Interspecific comparisons
   have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of
   animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part,
   to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and
   similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine
   species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the
   usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of
   between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity.
   We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing
   the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening
   stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the
   reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community
   analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation
   procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and
   identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found
   that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some
   species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that
   ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to
   comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Exploration of the environment is a key behaviour in animals. The
   exploratory behaviour of species or populations depends on different
   aspects of their ecology. New evidence suggests that differences in
   exploratory behaviour might also be related to life history strategies,
   with fast-lived animals (high metabolic rate, short life span) being
   faster explorers than slow-lived ones. We tested this assumption in
   shrews. Shrews are divided into two phylogenetic groups, which differ
   tremendously in life history. We compared the exploratory behaviour of
   three species, covering both phylogenetic groups. Shrews of the
   fast-lived genus Sorex were quicker to start exploration and to locate
   the first food patch. They also moved faster than the slow-lived genus
   Crocidura. Unlike many studies on exploratory behaviour that analyse
   only a short period of time (i.e. a single exploration bout with a fixed
   duration), we analysed the species-specific allocation of prolonged
   total exploration time into exploration bouts. Using this method, we
   could show that Sorex performed more, but shorter exploration bouts than
   Crocidura. Our results support the hypothesis of exploratory behaviour
   being related to life history. While the species we tested occur
   sympatrically, the two genera differ strongly in the climatic zones they
   inhabit. It is likely that also during evolution they faced different
   types of habitat and thus different selection pressures. These
   differences in evolutionary histories possibly favoured the evolution of
   their diversified life histories and exploration strategies. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Recent research in songbirds has demonstrated that male singing behavior
   varies systematically with personality traits such as exploration and
   risk taking. Here we examine whether the production of bird calls, in
   addition to bird songs, is repeatable and related to exploratory
   behavior, using the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) as a
   model. We assessed the exploratory behavior of individual birds in a
   novel environment task. We then recorded the vocalizations and
   accompanying motor behavior of both male and female chickadees, over the
   course of several days, in two different contexts: a control condition
   with no playback and a stressful condition where chick-a-dee mobbing
   calls were played to individual birds. We found that several
   vocalizations and behaviors were repeatable within both a control and a
   stressful context, and across contexts. While there was no relationship
   between vocal output and exploratory behavior in the control context,
   production of alarm and chick-a-dee calls in the stressful condition was
   positively associated with exploratory behavior. These findings are
   important because they show that bird calls, in addition to bird song,
   are an aspect of personality, in that calls are consistent both within
   and across contexts, and covary with other personality measures
   (exploration).}},

Abstract = {{Breeding success among male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)

   We investigated the effect of relative body mass on breeding success in

   larger males on average had identical levels of breeding success (59\%
   of breeding opportunities) in the 1st and 2nd halves of the breeding
   season. The variability of breeding success increased with greater
   relative mass; thus deer with substantial mass disadvantages had only
   limited success, and males weighing >= 92\% of the pen average had
   success ranging from 0\% to 100\% of potential breeding opportunities.
   Although constant proximity limited males primarily to a strategy of
   direct confrontation, some subordinate males evidently mated
   opportunistically when >1 female was receptive. We conclude that >= 1
   uncontrolled variable, possibly related to aggressiveness or
   life-history strategy, remained influential and limited the ability of
   some males to compete successfully in spite of greater relative body

Abstract = {{The extent and importance of consistent individual differences in
   behaviour, often referred to as `personality' or `temperament', is a
   relatively recent question in ecology. It indicates that animal
   behaviour is much less flexible than usually assumed, and suggests that
   individuals consistently differ in the way they perceive and react to
   changes in the environment. There is evidence of animal personality in a
   wide variety of animal taxa, including many freshwater fish species, but
   there seems to be very little evidence for this phenomenon in marine
   fish. To address this paucity, we repeatedly measured 3 behavioural
   traits of 2 temperate marine damselfish species, Parma microlepis and P.
   unifasciata, over a 2 wk period. Consistent individual differences in
   boldness, aggressiveness and activity were observed in both species, but
   average levels of these traits did not differ between species. A
   correlation between personality traits was also observed, with bolder
   individuals also tending to be more aggressive. The existence of
   personality in marine fish has implications for practical issues such as
   sampling bias, vulnerability to harvest and links between personality
   and life-history traits that affect fitness.}},

Title = {{Participation in cooperative prey capture and the benefits gained from

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{In animal societies, behavioral idiosyncrasies of the individuals often
   guide which tasks they should perform. Such personality-specific task
   participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving
   group performance. While several recent studies have documented
   group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality)
   diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is
   unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of
   personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus
   dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold
   individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all
   group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by
   examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated
   predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective
   foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals
   are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate
   the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy
   spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and
   then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single
   feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture
   (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and
   colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than
   purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in
   more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation
   than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold
   individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These
   findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape
   social organization, individual performance, and group success.}},

Title = {{Personality in the cockroach Diploptera punctata: Evidence for stability
   across developmental stages despite age effects on boldness}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Despite a recent surge in the popularity of animal personality studies
   and their wide-ranging associations with various aspects of behavioural
   ecology, our understanding of the development of personality over
   ontogeny remains poorly understood. Stability over time is a central
   tenet of personality; ecological pressures experienced by an individual
   at different life stages may, however, vary considerably, which may have
   a significant effect on behavioural traits. Invertebrates often go
   through numerous discrete developmental stages and therefore provide a
   useful model for such research. Here we test for both differential
   consistency and age effects upon behavioural traits in the gregarious
   cockroach Diploptera punctata by testing the same behavioural traits in
   both juveniles and adults. In our sample, we find consistency in
   boldness, exploration and sociality within adults whilst only boldness
   was consistent in juveniles. Both boldness and exploration measures,
   representative of risk-taking behaviour, show significant consistency
   across discrete juvenile and adult stages. Age effects are, however,
   apparent in our data; juveniles are significantly bolder than adults,
   most likely due to differences in the ecological requirements of these
   life stages. Size also affects risk-taking behaviour since smaller
   adults are both bolder and more highly explorative. Whilst a behavioural
   syndrome linking boldness and exploration is evident in nymphs, this
   disappears by the adult stage, where links between other behavioural
   traits become apparent. Our results therefore indicate that differential
   consistency in personality can be maintained across life stages despite
   age effects on its magnitude, with links between some personality traits
   changing over ontogeny, demonstrating plasticity in behavioural
   syndromes.}},

Journal = {{FISH AND FISHERIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{571-577}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marine reserves are valued for their ecological role: protecting fish
   populations from overharvesting while, at the same time, potentially
   maintaining fisheries yields via recruitment effects (net export of
   pelagic eggs and larvae) and spillover (net export of post-settled
   juveniles and mature fish) across reserve borders. Focussing on the
   spillover effect, we argue that when fitness of the protected
   individuals depends on the relative size of their home ranges compared
   to the reserve size, and home range size is a property of the
   individuals, rapid local adaptation might occur in favour of individuals
   with smaller home ranges. Individuals that avoid fishing mortality by
   spending most of the time inside the reserve limits (i.e. with smaller
   home ranges) will experience a fitness advantage, whereas individuals
   that move beyond boundaries (i.e. with larger home ranges) will increase
   their risk of being harvested by spillover fisheries. We use empirical
   data on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) home ranges within and around a
   coastal marine reserve in south Norway as a case to illustrate our idea.
   Broadly, we highlight how protection-induced selection and contemporary
   evolution could fundamentally alter our perspective of marine reserve
   functioning and recommend quantifying behavioural variability and
   behavioural consistency of protected populations.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of among-individual variation and
   covariation in behaviours are of substantial interest to behavioural
   ecology, but the proximate mechanisms underpinning this (co) variation
   are still unclear. Previous research suggests metabolic rate as a
   potential proximate mechanism to explain behavioural covariation. We
   measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR), boldness and exploration in
   western stutter-trilling crickets, Gryllus integer, selected
   differentially for short and fast development over two generations.
   After applying mixed-effects models to reveal the sign of the
   covariation, we applied structural equation models to an
   individual-level covariance matrix to examine whether the RMR generates
   covariation between the measured behaviours. All traits showed
   among-individual variation and covariation: RMR and boldness were
   positively correlated, RMR and exploration were negatively correlated,
   and boldness and exploration were negatively correlated. However, the
   RMR was not a causal factor generating covariation between boldness and
   exploration. Instead, the covariation between all three traits was
   explained by another, unmeasured mechanism. The selection lines differed
   from each other in all measured traits and significantly affected the
   covariance matrix structure between the traits, suggesting that there is
   a genetic component in the trait integration. Our results emphasize that
   interpretations made solely from the correlation matrix might be
   misleading.}},

Abstract = {{Whether human disturbance can lead to directional selection and
   phenotypic change in behaviour in species with limited behavioural
   plasticity is poorly understood in wild animal populations. Using a
   19-year study on Montagus harrier, we report a long-term increase in
   boldness towards humans during nest visits. The probability of females
   fleeing or being passive during nest visits decreased, while defence
   intensity steadily increased over the study period. These behavioural
   responses towards humans were significantly repeatable. The phenotypic
   composition of the breeding population changed throughout the study
   period (4-5 harrier generations), with a gradual disappearance of shy
   individuals, leading to a greater proportion of bolder ones and a more
   behaviourally homogeneous population. We further show that nest visit
   frequency increased nest failure probability and reduced productivity of
   shy females, but not of bold ones. Long-term research or conservation
   programmes needing nest visits can therefore lead to subtle but relevant
   population compositional changes that require further attention.}},

Abstract = {{Successful and cost-effective conservation breeding programs rely
   largely on animals doing what should come naturally: mate \& reproduce.
   Behavioral management, especially that targeting mate compatibility and
   choice, will be important to achieve breeding goals efficiently. The
   endangered giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, was once notorious for
   its poor reproductive performance in captivity. Although the panda
   breeding program has experienced great improvement in recent years, we
   hypothesized that a better understanding of the role personality traits
   play in mating behavior could further improve reproductive performance.
   We used animal caretaker surveys and novel object tests to characterize
   pandas according to several personality traits including exploratory,
   aggressiveness, excitability, fearfulness, and general activity and
   tested how variation in these traits influenced mate compatibility and
   offspring production. Our findings indicate that specific combinations
   of personality traits showed better reproductive performance than
   others. Sometimes personality trait similarity enhanced reproduction and
   sometimes it impaired reproduction, depending on the trait. For example,
   Excitable males paired with Low-Excitable females had better
   reproductive outcomes, but pairs with Low-Fearful males regardless of
   the female's Fearfulness performed better. Males that were more
   Aggressive than their female partner were more likely to mate and
   produce cubs than when the female had a higher level of Aggressiveness
   than the male. Applying these results to breeding management strategies
   should result in higher reproductive rates and the production of more
   candidates for China's panda reintroduction program. These results
   highlight the potential importance of associative mating patterns based
   on personality for conservation breeding programs for a large number of
   other species. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the following hypotheses were explored using zebrafish
   Danio rerio: (1) individuals from the same cohort differ consistently in
   activity and risk-taking and (2) variation in activity and risk-taking
   is linked to individual differences in metabolic rate, body length and
   body condition. To examine these hypotheses, juvenile D. rerio were
   tested for routine metabolic rate and subsequently exposed to an open
   field test. Strong evidence was found for consistent among-individual
   differences in activity and risk-taking, which were overall negatively
   correlated with body length, i.e. larger D. rerio were found to be less
   active in a potentially dangerous open field and a similar trend was
   found with respect to a more direct measure of their risk-taking
   tendency. In contrast, routine metabolic rate and body condition were
   uncorrelated with both activity and risk-taking of juvenile D. rerio.
   These findings suggest that body length is associated with risk-related
   behaviours in juvenile D. rerio for which larger, rather than smaller,
   individuals may have a higher risk of predation, while the role for
   routine metabolic rate is relatively limited or non-existent, at least
   under the conditions of the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can affect prey both directly (consumptive effects) and
   indirectly (nonconsumptive effects), with a growing body of literature
   showing the latter may have pronounced effects. Prey populations are
   comprised of individuals that differ in perception of and willingness to
   take risk; therefore, studying how different types of individuals
   respond to predation risk is necessary to fully understand prey
   dynamics. Playbacks were used to experimentally manipulate perceived
   predation risk in nest-box populations of wild great tits (Parus major)
   to examine the nonconsumptive effects of avian predators on prey
   behavior and morphology, and to explore individual differences in prey
   response. Individuals responded to our treatment, and responses differed
   depending on both treatment and pre-manipulation behavioral type. Birds
   in areas exposed to predator playback tended to decrease in body mass
   more than birds exposed to nonthreatening (control) playback.
   Differences between treatment groups were mainly driven by initially
   fast exploring birds: In the control treatment, fast explorers increased
   in mass, whereas the initially fast exploring birds in the predation
   treatment decreased in mass. Furthermore, birds exposed to predator
   playback decreased exploratory tendency compared with controls. These
   findings demonstrate that predation risk alters great tit behavior
   (exploration) and morphology (body mass) and that plasticity in response
   to risk relates to an individual's willingness to take risks. Our
   findings suggest that individuals differ in susceptibility to predation
   risk, causing adaptive individual differences in responsiveness to
   changes in predation risk. Acknowledging individuality in responses to
   perceived predation risk has important consequences for understanding
   prey dynamics.}},

Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{127-135}},

Abstract = {{Animals adjust their behaviour over time and contexts to cope with
   ecological and environmental variation. However, the presence of
   consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e.
   personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible
   than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the
   experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect
   estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and
   risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki,
   a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk
   taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a
   standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied
   linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter
   mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity
   increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks
   was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on
   average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We
   highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal
   variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with
   escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small
   environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank
   size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking
   and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality
   estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank
   orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that
   behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that
   personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to
   variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{193-205}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to
   different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether
   these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare.
   Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive
   success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the
   exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests
   and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour
   (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness
   were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal
   component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the
   females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in
   two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014
   we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our
   results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected
   by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which
   may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female
   reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was
   only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at
   the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was
   additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food
   availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and
   explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We
   conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of
   the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive
   impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food
   availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of
   personality on reproductive success differed between changing
   environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that
   different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by
   varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{We here respond to the claim by Schilder and colleagues (Schilder, M. B.
   H., Vinke, C. M., van der Borg, J. A. M., 2014. Dominance in domestic
   dogs revisited: Useful habit and useful construct? J. Vet. Behav.: Clin.
   App. Res. 9, 184-191) that dominance is a useful construct in the
   interpretation of companion dog behavior. We first make the distinction
   between the well-established use of the dominance framework in the
   ethology of wild species, and its more contentious use in the domestic
   dog as a character trait and as a descriptor of motivation. By
   evaluating recent studies of canine ``personality{''} (individual
   differences in behavior that are consistent across time and context), we
   conclude that there is no evidence that dominance is a character trait
   of individual dogs, but rather that it is a property of relationships,
   that can arise due to asymmetries in any one of at least 3 distinct
   personality traits. We question whether concepts derived from wolf
   behavior have much utility in interpreting the behavior of domestic dogs
   because recent studies of groups of free-ranging dogs confirm that the
   dog has lost 3 traits key to the social organization of the gray wolf,
   namely coordinated group hunting, reproductive suppression, and
   provisioning of cubs by nonreproducing relatives. We further question
   whether studies of free-ranging dogs, which routinely compete for
   physical resources, provide an appropriate framework for interpreting
   the behavior of companion dogs, which generally do not. We then
   reinterpret Schenkel's ``active submission{''} posture as primarily
   affiliative and an indicator of the dependence of younger, inexperienced
   dogs on the older members of their social group. By reviewing the key
   literature on the cognitive abilities of domestic dogs and other social
   Carnivora, we demonstrate that the primate-based ``Utrecht School{''}
   model of dominance makes assumptions that are invalid for domestic dogs,
   because the overwhelming balance of evidence indicates that
   relationships among social Carnivora are based on noncognitive
   mechanisms. We conclude by examining the implications of Schilder and
   colleagues' model for the management of relationships between dogs and
   their owners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change, such as elevated temperatures, may facilitate biological
   invasion. Aquatic animal systems are more vulnerable to biological
   invasion when the temperature rises. Animal personality also plays an
   important role in the possibility of successful establishment of
   invasive species. However, it is still unclear how personality traits of
   invasive species will respond to global warming. This study focuses on
   juveniles of red swamp crawfish Procambarus clarkii, an invasive
   poikilothermic species with wide distribution throughout the world, and
   explores how slight temperature increases influence three personality
   traits (activity, boldness and aggressiveness) of P. clarkii. For each
   personality, individual variation is to be presented in condition of the
   same temperature. Individual personality values can significantly
   increase with the subtle rising of water temperature. Significant
   correlations among activity, boldness and aggressiveness are found at
   any temperature stage, and such relationships are maintained at a
   similar level in the face of different temperatures. It is most likely
   that significant expressions of personality traits may be an ecological
   compensation strategy to offset increased metabolic costs when faced
   with small temperature increases. Aggression syndromes are formed due to
   stable linkages between personality traits, in order to acquire
   allopatric resources efficiently and establish a new population in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The study of personality has aroused much interest and has provided
   insight into the understanding of animal behavior. Nevertheless, the
   study of the ecological consequences of personality is a newer field
   that could shed light on cases of alien species introductions. The
   goldfish (Carassius auratus) is frequently introduced worldwide and
   affects the abundance of newts, having an especially negative impact on
   an alternative phenotype, the paedomorph, which maintains larval traits
   at the adult stage, unlike the other phenotype, the metamorph, which has
   undergone metamorphosis. We experimentally assessed the impact of
   goldfish on the foraging behavior of both phenotypes of palmate newts
   (Lissotriton helveticus). More particularly, we assessed fish
   personality by analyzing the foraging activity and the aggressiveness
   toward newts, and newt personality by analyzing individual difference in
   boldness. In the presence of fish, fewer newts foraged than in their
   absence, and paedomorphs were more affected than metamorphs. We found
   strong personality differences in fish and fewer newts foraged in the
   presence of a more aggressive fish. Newts differed in boldness, but fish
   aggressiveness remains a key factor to explain newt behavior. Studying
   behavioral interactions between native and alien species helps to
   understand the mechanisms of coexistence and exclusion and why different
   phenotypes might be affected differently by the same threat. To a great
   extent, not only the presence of fish alters the foraging opportunities
   of newts but also the personality of the invader; integrating
   personality patterns of invaders is therefore a key to understanding the
   ecological consequences of alien species introduction.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic range has long been noted to be associated with many
   organismic and ecological traits such as body size and species richness.
   However, much less is known about whether and how ecological variation
   across latitudinal gradients reflects behavioral variation. Ant colonies
   may also show behavioral variation, and Temnothorax rugatulus show a
   colony-level behavioral syndrome that seems to reflect risk tolerance
   across their North American range. While it is presumed that this
   pattern is the result of adaptation to local environmental conditions,
   which ecological factors are driving this variation are unknown. Here,
   we test if colony risk tolerance is affected by competition, predation,
   resource availability, or environmental stress at each site. Our results
   show that increased competition, specifically for nest sites, as well as
   increased spatial clustering of colonies predicts higher risk tolerance.
   Additionally, the spatial clustering of colonies influences the
   structure of the risk-taking syndrome, i.e., which colony-level
   behaviors are correlated and how strongly. This emphasizes the need for
   understanding large-scale geographic variation in behavior, as it may
   explain how ecological factors drive the evolution and maintenance of
   intraspecific behavioral variation across populations.}},

Title = {{Testing for relationships between individual crab behavior and metabolic

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1343-1351}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two classes of explanations for covariation between activity level and
   metabolic rate among conspecifics have been proposed. First,
   individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement
   of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because
   movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second,
   energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual
   activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of
   metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history
   traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential
   relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud
   crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of
   crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine
   metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms
   that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard
   metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both
   activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of
   predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne
   chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was
   repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship,
   individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab
   activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological
   relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to
   activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts
   behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves.
   We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic
   rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of
   considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional
   relationships between individual behavior and energetics.}},

   snails}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The existence of consistent individual differences in behaviour ('animal
   personality') has been well documented in recent years. However, how
   such individual variation in behaviour is maintained over evolutionary
   time is an ongoing conundrum. A well-studied axis of animal personality
   is individual variation along a bold-shy continuum, where individuals
   differ consistently in their propensity to take risks. A predation-risk
   cost to boldness is often assumed, but also that the reproductive
   benefits associated with boldness lead to equivalent fitness outcomes
   between bold and shy individuals over a lifetime. However, an
   alternative or complementary explanation may be that bold individuals
   phenotypically compensate for their risky lifestyle to reduce predation
   costs, for instance by investing in more pronounced morphological
   defences. Here, we investigate the `phenotypic compensation' hypothesis,
   i.e. that bold individuals exhibit more pronounced anti-predator
   defences than shy individuals, by relating shell shape in the aquatic
   snail Radix balthica to an index of individual boldness. Our analyses
   find a strong relationship between risk-taking propensity and shell
   shape in this species, with bolder individuals exhibiting a more
   defended shell shape than shy individuals. We suggest that this supports
   the `phenotypic compensation' hypothesis and sheds light on a previously
   poorly studied mechanism to promote the maintenance of personality
   variation among animals.}},

Abstract = {{Personality and behavioral syndromes are of significant interest to a
   wide range of biological disciplines. Recent research using network
   analysis techniques has revealed widespread variation among individuals
   in sociability, which is a major axis of personality that creates the
   social microenvironment in which individuals express all other
   behaviors. We investigated the relationship between sociability and
   boldness, another fundamental personality axis, using a wild population
   of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) tested in their natural
   environment. We studied 2 dimensions of sociability (grouping behavior
   and association patterns). Over 2 years we found significant
   within-individual consistency and interindividual variation in the
   foraging group sizes of 171 females. Network analysis comparisons of 103
   females between the years, using HWIG (an association index that
   controls for gregariousness), showed that individuals were also highly
   consistent in their social network measures. We tested the boldness of
   51 of these females 6-21 times each over 18 months, using flight
   initiation distance tests; individuals were also highly consistent in
   this measure of personality. Shy females had significantly larger mean
   foraging group sizes. After controlling for gregariousness and space
   use, shy females had fewer preferred associates than bolder females.
   Therefore, boldness can have an important influence on the size and
   composition of foraging groups and thus social networks, in wild
   mammals.}},

Title = {{Domestication effects on behavioural traits and learning performance:
   comparing wild cavies to guinea pigs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL COGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{99-109}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The domestication process leads to a change in behavioural traits,
   usually towards individuals that are less attentive to changes in their
   environment and less aggressive. Empirical evidence for a difference in
   cognitive performance, however, is scarce. Recently, a functional
   linkage between an individual's behaviour and cognitive performance has
   been proposed in the framework of animal personalities via a shared
   risk-reward trade-off. Following this assumption, bolder and more
   aggressive animals (usually the wild form) should learn faster.
   Differences in behaviour may arise during ontogeny due to individual
   experiences or represent adaptations that occurred over the course of
   evolution. Both might singly or taken together account for differences
   in cognitive performance between wild and domestic lineages. To test for
   such possible linkages, we compared wild cavies and domestic guinea
   pigs, both kept in a university stock for more than 30 years under
   highly comparable conditions. Animals were tested in three behavioural
   tests as well as for initial and reversal learning performance. Guinea
   pigs were less bold and aggressive than their wild congeners, but learnt
   an association faster. Additionally, the personality structure was
   altered during the domestication process. The most likely explanation
   for these findings is that a shift in behavioural traits and their
   connectivity led to an altered cognitive performance. A functional
   linkage between behavioural and cognitive traits seems to exist in the

Abstract = {{Mate choice is known as an important behavior allowing females to choose
   the best mate to increase their reproductive success. To estimate male
   quality, females can use multiple traits. Among those, recent studies
   have shown that male personality traits could play an important role in
   mate choice as they are often linked to major life-history traits and
   can be heritable. However, because the relationships between
   life-history traits and personality traits are context dependent,
   females are expected to choose male personality types according to the
   mating context. In this study on common lizards (Zootoca vivipara), we
   examined the role of personality traits in female mate choice and mating
   behavior after experimentally manipulating the predation risk
   experienced by females prior to mating. We showed that females not
   exposed to predator cues preferred males with high-activity level, a
   heritable behavior. When females are exposed to predator cues prior to
   mating, this preference was reversed. High-activity levels generally
   increase competitive abilities and survival but could be detrimental
   when predators are present. Our results suggest that female common
   lizards choose males based on their personality types and can modify
   their preferences according to their environmental context in order to
   produce offspring that are better adapted to their environment.}},

Abstract = {{In response to acute predation threats, prey may sacrifice foraging
   opportunities in favour of increased predator avoidance. Under
   conditions of high or frequent predation risk, such trade-offs may lead
   to reduced fitness. Here, we test the prediction that prey reduce the
   costs associated with lost opportunities following acute predation
   threats by exhibiting short-term compensatory foraging responses. Under
   semi-natural conditions, we exposed female guppies Poecilia reticulate
   from high and low predation risk sites to one of three levels of acute
   predation threat (high, intermediate or low concentrations of
   conspecific alarm cues). Our results confirm previous reports,
   demonstrating that guppies from a high predation site were consistently
   `bolder' (shorter escape latencies) and exhibited graded
   threat-sensitive responses to different simulated threat levels while
   those from the low predation site were `shyer' and exhibited non-graded
   responses. Most importantly, we found that when guppies from low
   predation sites resumed foraging, they did so at rates significantly
   lower than baseline rates. However, guppies from high predation sites
   resumed foraging either at rates equal to baseline (in response to low
   or intermediate risk stimuli) or significantly increased relative to
   baseline rates (in response to high risk stimuli). Together, these
   results highlight a complex compensatory behavioral mechanism that may
   allow prey to reduce the long-term costs associated with predator
   avoidance.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{387-391}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of studies
   devoted to consistent individual differences in behavior, termed
   ``behavioral syndromes{''} or animal ``personality{''}. In particular,
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists alike seek to explore the
   functional consequences of individuals' personalities and explanations
   for their general maintenance. Understanding the mechanistic
   underpinnings to personality is arguably key to a deeper understanding
   of their functional consequences and maintenance. In particular,
   consistent individual differences in metabolic rate have been proposed
   as a general explanation for the maintenance of consistent individual
   differences in boldness, aggressiveness, and activity level. In this
   paper we explore whether consistent individual differences in boldness
   are associated with heat rate, a proxy for metabolic rate, in two
   species of orb-weaving spider: Larinioides cornutus and L. patagiatus.
   We first documented consistent individual differences in boldness in L.
   cornutus but not L. patagiatus, as estimated by individuals' latency to
   resume movement following an aversive stimulus. We also measured
   individuals' heart rate twice in a separate situation. We then tested
   for an association between individuals' boldness and their heart rate
   during these two events. We found that increased boldness was associated
   with increased heart. Thus, individuals that resumed movement quickly
   following an aversive stimulus also exhibited faster heart rates. Our
   studies provide further evidence that consistent individual differences
   in key physiological attributes, like metabolic rate, might be a general
   mechanism underlying consistent individual differences in behavior.}},

Title = {{Individual differences in chimpanzee reconciliation relate to social
   switching behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the presence of stable individual variation in animal
   behaviour has been corroborated by studies across a wide variety of taxa
   and research disciplines. Reconciliation, or postconflict affiliation
   between former opponents, is a behavioural domain in which individual
   differences have not been systematically studied. Using a long-term data
   set comprising over 2000 conflict and postconflict observations in two
   groups of outdoor-housed chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we provide
   evidence for stable individual variation in reconciliation and test
   several hypotheses on how this postconflict mechanism relates to social
   switching behaviour. Results of generalized multilevel models revealed
   that individual differences remained a substantial source of variation
   in reconciliation after controlling for a number of situational
   variables (e. g. the nature of the relationship between opponents) shown
   by previous research to influence its occurrence. We further
   demonstrated a positive association between an individual's conciliatory
   tendency and three separate indices of social switching behaviour,
   proposing that individual differences in reconciliation may reflect a
   more fundamental motivation to switch between different social states.
   In addition to a discussion of potential motivational underpinnings, we
   provide an impetus for future work to consider how reconciliation
   relates to the broader constructs and themes identified within animal
   personality research. To the extent that individual differences in other
   aspects of conflict and postconflict repertoires exhibit temporal and
   cross-situational consistency, they too should inform our understanding
   of animal personalities. Delineating how these and other dimensions of
   sociality are in part driven by stable individual variation not only has
   implications for how social interactions themselves unfold, but
   ultimately for the fitness of the individuals therein. (C) 2014 The

   Make Longer Vacancy Chains}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1014-1023}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality has been investigated in a variety of contexts but
   few studies have investigated the effects of individual-level traits on
   processes that occur at the group or population level. Vacancy chains
   describe sequences of linked vacancy moves in systems where individuals
   use discrete and reuseable resource units. When a new resource unit
   becomes available, this can cause a cascade of moves between resource
   units, beyond the first individual that encounters the new unit. Thus,
   vacancy chains can drive the distribution of resources through a
   population. Here, I investigate the effect of variation in boldness on
   movements between vacant gastropod shells in the hermit crab Pagurus
   bernhardus. Boldness was quantified using the duration of a startle
   response, which varied consistently between individuals. In groups of
   five crabs, introduction of a single new shell led to aggregate
   benefits, in terms of improving shell quality, across all group members.
   Boldness did not influence the extent of these benefits or the extent to
   which they were distributed between crabs of different sizes. Initially,
   vacancy chains were longer, indicating that more individuals moved
   between shells, for bold groups compared with shy groups. After 24h,
   however, the chain length was longer for shy groups. Thus, although
   participation in a vacancy chain may lead to similar benefits, these
   could be more widespread for groups comprising shy individuals that show
   long startle responses, low inquisitiveness and low aggression. Similar
   effects on resource acquisition could be present in other examples of
   animals that utilise reusable resource units and show consistent
   between-individual differences in behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Intragenotypic variability (IGV) occurs when individuals with the same
   genotype, reared in the same environment and then tested under the same
   conditions, express different trait values. Game theoretical and
   bet-hedging models have suggested two ways that a single genotype might
   generate variable behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete
   rather than continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces
   different types of individuals, each of which consistently expresses a
   different type of behaviour) or stochastic variability (a genotype
   produces one type of individual that randomly expresses different types
   of behaviour over time). We first demonstrated significant differences
   across 14 natural genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the
   variability (as measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice in an
   experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four different
   types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about ways that
   within-individual variability might contribute to differences across
   genotypes in the variability of microhabitat choice. There was no
   empirical support for three hypotheses (behavioural polymorphism,
   consistent choice, or time-based choice), nor could our results be
   attributed to genotypic differences in activity levels. The stochastic
   variability hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept
   of the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the individual
   level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our initial version of
   the stochastic model slightly but significantly overestimated the values
   of individual entropy for each genotype, pointing to specific
   assumptions of this model that might need to be adjusted in future
   studies of the IGV of microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of
   recent studies to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and
   the first to explore ways that genotypic differences in
   within-individual variability might contribute to differences among
   genotypes in the predictability of their behaviour. (C) 2013 The

   exploration behaviour predicts offspring exploration behaviour in zebra

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Consistent behavioural differences among individuals are common in many
   species and can have important effects on offspring fitness. To
   understand such `personality' variation, it is important to determine
   the mode of inheritance, but this has been quantified for only a few
   species. Here, we report results from a breeding experiment in captive
   zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which we cross-fostered offspring
   to disentangle the importance of genetic and non-genetic transmission of
   behaviour. Genetic and foster-parents' exploratory type was measured in
   a novel environment pre-breeding and offspring exploratory type was
   assessed at adulthood. Offspring exploratory type was predicted by the
   exploratory behaviour of the foster but not the genetic parents, whereas
   offspring size was predicted by genetic but not foster-parents' size.
   Other aspects of the social environment, such as rearing regime
   (uni-versus biparental), hatching position, brood size or an
   individual's sex did not influence offspring exploration. Our results
   therefore indicate that non-genetic transmission of behaviour can play
   an important role in shaping animal personality variation.}},

Abstract = {{Vigilance is an essential component of antipredator behaviour and is
   also used to monitor conspecifics, but is traded off against feeding in
   herbivores. This trade-off can be influenced by variation in many
   environmental, social and individual traits. Our aim was to test the
   relationship between individual-level traits, including boldness, body
   condition and reproductive state, and vigilance, while controlling for
   environmental and social variables. Using multiple 5-min video samples
   of 30 foraging, individually recognisable, female eastern grey kangaroos
   (Macropus giganteus) at Sundown National Park in Queensland, we
   investigated individual-level variation in the duration, intensity and
   target of vigilance behaviour during foraging. On separate occasions, we
   used flight-initiation distance tests to measure boldness in our
   kangaroos. Females with longer flight-initiation distances (shyer
   females) spent more time vigilant, providing preliminary support for
   studies of animal personality that have suggested that boldness may
   covary with vigilance. Body condition did not affect the total time
   spent vigilant, but females in poorer body condition spent more of their
   vigilance time in low-intensity vigilance. Vigilance patterns were not
   related to reproductive state, but varied among months and differed
   between mornings and afternoons, and females spent more time in
   high-intensity vigilance when further from cover. Even after accounting
   for all our variables we found that 7\% of the variation in total time
   vigilant and 14\% of the variation in vigilance intensity was explained
   by individual identity. This highlights the importance of
   individual-level variation in vigilance behaviour.}},

Title = {{Linking Personality to Larval Energy Reserves in Rainbow Trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{There is a surging interest in the evolution, ecology and physiology of
   personality differences. However, most of the studies in this research
   area have been performed in adult animals. Trait variations expressed
   early in development and how they are related to the ontogeny of an
   animal's personality are far less studied. Genetic differences as well
   as environmental factors causing functional variability of the central
   serotonergic system have been related to personality differences in
   vertebrates, including humans. Such gene-environment interplay suggests
   that the central serotonergic system plays an important role in the
   ontogeny of personality traits. In salmonid fishes, the timing of
   emergence from spawning nests is related to energy reserves, aggression,
   and social dominance. However, it is currently unknown how the size of
   the yolk reserve is reflected on aggression and dominance, or if these
   traits are linked to differences in serotonergic transmission in newly
   emerged larvae. In this study we investigated the relationship between
   yolk reserves, social dominance, and serotonergic transmission in newly
   emerged rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae. This was conducted
   by allowing larvae with the same emergence time, but with different yolk
   sizes, to interact in pairs for 24 h. The results show that individuals
   with larger yolks performed more aggressive acts, resulting in a
   suppression of aggression in individuals with smaller yolks. A higher
   brain serotonergic activity confirmed subordination in larvae with small
   yolks. The relationship between social dominance and yolk size was
   present in siblings, demonstrating a link between interfamily variation
   in energy reserves and aggression, and suggests that larger yolk
   reserves fuel a more aggressive personality during the initial
   territorial establishment in salmonid fishes. Furthermore, socially
   naive larvae with big yolks had lower serotonin levels, suggesting that
   other factors than the social environment causes variation in
   serotonergic transmission, underlying individual variation in aggressive
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Choice of pacing strategy and the benefit of aerodynamic drafting are
   thought to be key determinants of racing performance. These effects have
   largely been analysed without reference to final outcome, in small
   datasets with low temporal resolution, and a focus on human swimming,
   cycling and running. Here, we determined the position and speed of 44
   803 racehorses, once per second, in 3 357 races ranging in length from
   1006 to 4225 m (50.9-292.9 seconds duration) using a validated radio
   tracking system. We find that aerodynamic drafting has a marked effect
   on horse performance, and hence racing outcome. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that race length-dependent pacing strategies are correlated
   with the fastest racing times, with some horses reaching a maximum speed
   in excess of 19 m s(-1). The higher speeds seen with certain pacing
   strategies may arise due to the nature of pack racing itself, or may be
   a reflection of individual capabilities, that is, corresponding to
   horses that perform well in roles suited to their `front-running' or
   `chaser' personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Although increasing attention is given to both the causes and
   consequences of variation in animal personality, the measurement of
   personality in captive or free-ranging individuals remains an issue. In
   particular, one important question concerns whether personality should
   be established from the existence of complex behavioral syndromes (a
   suite of correlated behavioral traits) or could be more easily deduced
   from a single variable. In that context, it has recently been suggested
   that handling stress, measured through breathing rate during handling,
   could be a good descriptor of personality, at least in passerine birds.
   The authors experimentally investigated to what extent handling stress
   was correlated with personality in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata), as assessed from a suite of repeatable behavioral traits,
   including activity, exploratory behavior, neophobia, and reaction to
   startle. Although breathing rate was repeatable across individuals, it
   was not related to any behavioral trait, suggesting that it cannot be
   used to quickly predict personality, at least in zebra finches.
   Breathing rate during handling, in addition, was related to morphology,
   questioning the fact that breathing rate during handling reflects
   personality irrespective of individual state. The authors suggest that
   inference on global personality from a reduced number of traits should
   be performed with caution.}},

   Temperament Traits in Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus)}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour (often referred to as
   `temperament' or `personality') has increasingly been shown to be
   relevant to understanding patterns of behaviour that may influence
   survival and reproductive success. Although observer ratings on
   expert-nominated behavioural descriptors have been successfully used to
   identify and measure temperament traits in non-human primates and other
   species, some researchers argue that these measurements may be
   contaminated by observer bias both in the nomination of descriptors and
   in ratings of individual animals by the observers. Instead, it has been
   suggested that a better means of measuring temperament relies on a
   bottom-up approach based on direct, quantitative measurements of a
   species' behavioural repertoire. In this study, we compare the utility
   of a trait-nomination-and-ratings approach and an approach using direct
   behavioural observation for identifying and describing the patterning of
   temperament traits a captive population of cockatiels (Nymphicus
   hollandicus). Our data show that the nomination-based and the
   behavioural repertoire-based approaches yield very similar pictures of
   the patterning of temperament traits in cockatiels, although trait
   scales generated using the nomination-and-ratings approach have higher
   internal consistency. Additionally, trait scores on both the behavioural
   repertoire-based trait scales and the nomination/ratings-based trait
   scales show reasonable power to predict observed behaviour, consistent
   with findings in both humans and non-human animals. The
   nomination/ratings approach seems to be more powerful in predicting
   birds' behaviour towards novel objects. While further validation is
   certainly needed, the present results suggest that both methods may have
   some utility for describing temperament in cockatiels.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{We describe a conceptual framework integrating animal personalities,
   movement ecology, social networks and parasite transmission. For
   directly transmitted parasites, parasite transmission depends on social
   interaction patterns that can be quantified using social network
   metrics. For indirectly transmitted parasites, the key can be
   transmission networks that quantify time-lagged contacts (e.g. where
   potential hosts visit locations used earlier by infected hosts). Social
   network connections (time-lagged or not) often result from shared space
   use determined by individual movements in response to key environmental
   factors. Movement ecology provides a framework for understanding these
   responses. Finally, individuals with different personalities likely
   respond differently to environmental factors in ways that influence the
   movements and space use that underlie network connectivity, which, in
   turn, affects parasite loads and transmission. We illustrate these key
   points with recent work on sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their
   ticks. By GPS tracking of nearly all adult lizards at our site, we found
   that lizards that more frequently shared the same refuges (where ticks
   detach and reattach to a new host) used earlier by other lizards tended
   to indeed have higher tick loads. Higher shared refuge use was
   associated with greater shared space use, in general. Shared space use
   with conspecifics was reduced by the lizards' general propensity
   (quantified by analyses of 279 985 GPS locations for 72 lizards) to
   avoid conspecifics, but enhanced by their general tendency to prefer
   areas with more resources and better refuge (in particular, late in the
   season when food was scarce and conditions were hotter and drier). Both
   of these tendencies were personality dependent. Less aggressive lizards
   exhibited both a stronger attraction to areas with more food and better
   refuge, and a stronger tendency to avoid other lizards. We conclude by
   discussing implications of our results for the general conceptual
   framework and suggest future directions. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{An evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment,
   and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with
   environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because
   sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences
   group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition.
   Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the
   social environment. The combination of the ecological and social
   environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological
   environment, which could explain variation in fitness.
   2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual
   social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as
   phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological
   environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of
   individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat
   selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may
   reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and
   social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment
   framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches.
   Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent,
   and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect
   reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.
   3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat
   selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive,
   consequences associated with changes in population density. The
   ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed
   socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density
   could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For
   instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population
   density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial
   phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual
   framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural
   traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and
   evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the
   socioecological environment.}},

Title = {{Aggression mediates dispersal tendency in an invasive lizard}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{29-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary
   process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and
   colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome
   suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural
   tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the
   composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately,
   colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition
   dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an
   individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as
   competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was
   linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression
   in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a
   successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to
   our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity,
   exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency
   was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals
   dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The
   presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1)
   dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2)
   aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding,
   thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of
   their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the
   ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and
   suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an
   important role in dispersal decisions. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Across a range of taxa, individuals within a species differ in suites of
   correlated traits. These trait complexes, known as syndromes, can have
   dramatic evolutionary consequences as they do not evolve independently
   but rather as a unit. Current research focuses primarily on syndromes
   relating to aspects of behavior and life history. What is less clear is
   whether physiological traits also form a syndrome. We measured 10
   thermal traits in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to test
   this idea. Repeatability was calculated and their across-context
   correlations evaluated. Our results were in alignment with our
   predictions in that individual thermal traits varied consistently and
   were structured into a physiological syndrome, which we are referring to
   as the thermal behavior syndrome (TBS). Within this syndrome, lizards
   exhibited a ``thermal type{''} with each being ranked along a cold-hot
   continuum. Hot types had faster sprint speeds and higher preferred body
   temperatures, whereas the opposite was true for cold types. We conclude
   that physiological traits may evolve as a single unit driven by the need
   to maintain optimal temperatures that enable fitness-related behaviors
   to be maximized.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{87-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Animals show consistent individual differences in behaviour across time
   and/or contexts. Recently, it has been suggested that proactive
   personality types might also exhibit fast cognitive styles. The speed
   with which individuals sample environmental cues is one way in which
   correlations between personality and cognition might arise. Here, we
   measured a collection of behavioural traits (competitiveness, neophobia,
   neophilia, task-directed motivation and exploration) in common mynas
   (Acridotheres tristis) and measured their relationship with problem
   solving. We predicted that fast solving mynas would interact with (i.e.
   sample) the problem solving task at higher rates, but also be more
   competitive, less neophobic, more neophilic, and more exploratory. Mynas
   that were faster to solve a novel foraging problem were no more
   competitive around food and no more inclined to take risks.
   Unexpectedly, these fast-solving mynas had higher rates of interactions
   with the task, but also displayed lower levels of exploration. It is
   possible that a negative relation between problem solving and spatial
   exploration arose as a consequence of how inter individual variation in
   exploration was quantified. We discuss the need for greater consensus on
   how to measure exploratory behaviour before we can advance our
   understanding of relationships between cognition and personality more
   effectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative
   tendencies. We discuss the broader evolutionary and ecological
   implications of our findings and propose that changes in social status
   should be considered when investigating behavioral syndromes and the
   interplay between animal personality and behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that high activity levels in animals increase growth at
   the cost of increased mortality. This growth-mortality tradeoff has
   recently been incorporated into the wider framework of the pace-of-life
   syndrome (POLS) hypothesis. However, activity is often quantified only
   in the laboratory and on a diurnal basis, leaving open the possibility
   that animals manage predation risk and feeding efficiency in the wild by
   modulating their circadian activity rhythms. Here we investigate how
   laboratory activity in wild brown trout parr (Salmo trutta L.)
   associates with circadian activity, growth, and mortality in their natal
   stream. We found that individuals with high activity in the laboratory
   displayed high dispersal and cathemeral activity in their natal stream.
   In contrast, trout with low laboratory activity showed variation of
   activity in the wild, which was negatively related to the light
   intensity. Our results do not support the growth-mortality trade-off of
   the POLS hypothesis as highly active, fast-growing individuals showed
   higher survival than inactive conspecifics. These novel results show for
   the first time that active and inactive individuals, as scored in the
   lab, can show different circadian patterns of behavior in the wild
   driven by light intensity. This implies that studies conducted under a
   narrow range of light conditions can bias our understanding of
   individual behavioral variation and its fitness consequences in the
   wild.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 50 years, evolutionary theory for animal behaviour has
   branched into different methodological frameworks focussing on age-,
   state-, density-, and frequency-dependent processes. These approaches
   have led to valuable insights in optimal responses, state dependent
   choices, and behavioural strategies in social contexts. We argue that
   time is ripe for an integration of these methodologies based on a
   rigorous implementation of proximate mechanisms. We describe such a
   modelling framework that is based on the architectural structures of
   sensing and information processing, physiological and neurological
   states, and behavioural control in animals. An individual-based model of
   this decision architecture is embedded in a genetic algorithm that finds
   evolutionary adaptations. This proximate architecture framework can be
   utilized for modelling behavioural challenges in complex environments,
   for example how animals make behavioural decisions based on multiple
   sources of information, or adapt to changing environments. The framework
   represents the evolution of the proximate mechanisms that underlie
   animal decision making, and it aligns with individual-based ecology by
   emphasizing the role of local information, perception, and individual
   behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

   ``social niche:{''} the set of social environments in which the focal
   individual has non-zero inclusive fitness. We consider the extent to
   which a social niche is analogous to an ecological niche, discuss
   whether a population-level social niche can be meaningfully identified,
   and describe conceptual insights about the properties of social niches,
   focusing on social niche construction. We highlight questions about
   social niches that demand more theoretical and empirical attention.}},

Abstract = {{Locomotion facilitates behaviour and its underlying physiological
   mechanisms may therefore impact behavioural phenotypes. Metabolism is
   often thought to modulate locomotion and behaviour, but empirical
   support for this suggestion is equivocal. Muscle contractile function is
   directly associated with locomotion. Here, we test the hypotheses that
   muscle mechanics determine locomotor performance and activity in
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) and thereby also affect risk-taking behaviour.
   We show that there is a mechanistic link between muscle performance and
   behaviour by manipulating muscle contractile properties, which caused
   proportional changes in critical sustained swimming performance and, in
   an open arena, voluntary swimming speed, the proportion of time fish
   were active, and the latency to move. We modelled the relationships
   between muscle contractile properties, swimming performance, activity
   and behaviour with a partial least-squares path model. The latent
   variable `muscle', formed by isolated muscle force production, stress,
   fatigue resistance and activation and relaxation rates, had a
   significant positive effect on swimming performance ('swim' reflected in
   sustained and sprint speeds). Together, muscle and swim had a
   significant positive effect on activity, and explained 71.8\% of
   variation in the distance moved, time active and maximum voluntary speed
   in an open field. Activity had a significant positive effect on
   boldness, explaining 76.0\% of variation in latencies to move and to
   approach a novel object. Muscle contractile function determines
   voluntary movement and we suggest that exploration and dispersal are
   functions of physiological and mechanical optimisation. Boldness
   therefore may be partly explained by the greater likelihood of faster
   fish to move further and encounter novel objects and conspecifics more
   quickly as a result.}},

Abstract = {{The study of personality in animals is a rapidly growing scientific
   field and numerous species have been reported to show consistent
   personality profiles. Much animal personality research has focused on
   nonhuman primates, with the main emphasis being placed on Old World
   primates, particularly rhesus macaques and chimpanzees. So far, little
   work has been done on cooperatively breeding nonhuman primates and New
   World species. Here, we study personality in the cooperatively breeding
   common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to broaden the taxonomic range of
   such research and to widen the perspective of comparative personality
   research. We use behavioral data collection and observer trait ratings
   to assess marmoset personality dimensions. The resulting behavioral and
   rating-derived personality dimensions, when viewed in tandem, resemble
   the human five-factor model and include extraversion, agreeableness,
   neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness. Correlations between the
   behavioral data and the observer trait-rated personality components
   suggest that the personality construct of common marmosets exhibits both
   convergent and discriminant validity. The finding of a distinct
   Conscientiousness component in this species extends previous knowledge
   in comparative personality psychology and warrants reconsideration of
   proposed taxonomic trait distributions.}},

Title = {{Context Matters: Multiple Novelty Tests Reveal Different Aspects of

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality research is receiving increasing interest from
   related fields, such as evolutionary personality psychology. By merging
   the conceptual understanding of personality, the contributions to both
   fields of research may be enhanced. In this study, we investigate animal
   personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying
   dispositional factors, which are not directly measurable, but which
   predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns.
   We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the
   consistency of inter-individual variation in behavioural responses
   towards novelty in 47 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were
   raised in identical housing conditions. Different stages of approach
   behaviour towards novelty, and how these related within and across
   contexts, were explored. Our experimental design contained four tests:
   two novel object tests (non-social contexts) and two novel animated
   stimuli tests (social contexts). Our results showed consistency in
   shyness measures across multiple tests, indicating the existence of
   personality in farmed American mink. It was found that consistency in
   shyness measures differs across non-social and social contexts, as well
   as across the various stages in the approach towards novel objects,
   revealing that different aspects of shyness exist in the farmed American
   mink. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the
   shyness-boldness continuum in the American mink. Since the mink were
   raised in identical housing conditions, inherited factors may have been
   important in shaping the consistent inter-individual variation. Body
   weight and sex had no effect on the personality of the mink. Altogether,
   our results suggest that the shyness-boldness continuum cannot be
   explained by a simple underlying dispositional factor, but instead
   encompasses a broader term of hesitating behaviour that might comprise
   several different personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Trait compensation denotes the situation in which individuals offset the
   costs of one trait with the benefits of another trait. The phenomenon of
   trait compensation is best exemplified by a negative correlation between
   the degree of predator avoidance and the strength of morphological
   defence. In this study, we used the relationship between risk-taking
   tendency (boldness) and the propensity for tail autotomy in the brown
   anole lizards Anolis sagrei to address two important questions regarding
   trait compensation. First, we investigated whether trait compensation
   existed among individuals of similar age. Second, we examined how the
   relationship between boldness and the propensity for tail autotomy
   responded to changes in food availability. Overall, bolder individuals
   autotomized their tails more readily. Although mean values of boldness
   and the propensity for tail autotomy did not differ under high and low
   food availability, the compensatory effect between the two traits was
   only obvious when food was abundant. The existence of trait compensation
   among similarly aged individuals will serve as the first step to
   understanding the evolution of compensatory effects among traits
   observed at higher level. In addition, food availability affected the
   dynamics of trait compensation by influencing the amount of variation of
   traits involved, rather than altering the mean values of traits per se.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, there has been growing interest among behavioral
   ecologists in exploring animal personalities. However, while the
   foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only
   little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the
   personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability
   and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of
   foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance
   and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal
   conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much
   stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality.
   Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of
   sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in
   substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling
   insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic
   alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals
   indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that
   repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy
   expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy
   expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how
   differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of
   plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Risk taking and avoidance responses during confinement have been
   identified in a variety of species, including fish. In addition,
   differences in metabolic rate have also been attributed to divergent
   personalities, coping styles or behavioral types. In this study we
   disclose for the first time a link between risk taking and the
   behavioral responses and oxygen consumption under confinement stress in
   the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. Fish were submitted to a
   risk-taking test twice to determine the consistency of behavioral
   responses. Afterwards fish were transferred to individual confinement
   chambers where their swimming activity and oxygen consumption were
   measured. Latency to take risks was negatively correlated to both
   movement and oxygen consumption rates, indicating that risk-avoiders
   (long latency) were less active and, hence, did not consume so much
   oxygen as risk-takers. In conclusion, this work reports the first data
   on the links between risk-taking and the behavioral responses and oxygen
   consumption during a confinement stress in fish. The relationships
   between behavioral and physiological variables are significant,
   suggesting the existence of divergent coping styles in gilthead
   seabream. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although our understanding of how animal personality affects fitness is
   incomplete, one general hypothesis is that personality traits (e.g.
   boldness and aggressiveness) contribute to competitive ability. If so,
   then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate
   variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here,
   we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of
   sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was
   evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest
   behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were
   also detected. A single vector explains 80 \% of the among-individual
   variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness.
   We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable
   tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster
   post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a
   dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there
   was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often
   predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may
   sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather
   than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as
   aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through
   impacts on resource acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in personality traits is observed commonly in many taxa but
   has been rarely studied in amphibians. We tested whether individual
   Bullfrog tadpoles exhibit personality, behaving consistently across
   multiple trials, and differently from conspecifics. From video footage
   of individual tadpoles in a familiar (home) environment and a novel
   environment (open field), we obtained measures of their level of
   activity, boldness, and exploration behavior over multiple trials. We
   found that activity level did not differ consistently between
   individuals. Boldness was moderately repeatable and exploration highly
   repeatable within individuals across trials, but only exploration varied
   significantly among individuals. These findings provide evidence of
   typical personality traits in tadpoles and support the value of Bullfrog
   tadpoles as model organisms in personality research.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing research has attempted to clarify the links between animal
   personality and physiology. However, the mechanisms driving this
   association remain largely unknown, and knowledge of how ecological
   factors may affect its direction and strength is scant. In this study,
   we quantified variation in the association between exploratory behavior,
   basal metabolic rate (BMR), and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) in
   rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) inhabiting desert,
   Mediterranean, and cold-temperate climates. We found that the
   exploratory behavior score was highest in birds from the cold-temperate
   site, which was characterized by a moderate level of ecological
   variability (seasonality). Moreover, the association between exploratory
   behavior and physiological variables differed among localities. Only
   birds from the Mediterranean site showed a positive correlation between
   exploratory behavior and BMR. We found no association between
   exploration and TEWL at any study site. Our findings suggest that
   differences in the ecological conditions experienced by each sparrow
   population result in a particular combination of behavioral and
   physiological traits. An understanding of this intraspecific variation
   along ecological gradients provides unique insights into how specific
   ecological conditions affect the coupling of behavioral and
   physiological traits and the mechanisms underlying that relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality is described as consistent differences in individual
   behavior across time or context, and may vary spatially. Bolder animals
   are more likely to migrate, grow slowly, or explore than shyer animals.
   Personality types within a population can also differ between discrete
   habitats or continuously across an environmental gradient. We examined
   the distribution of giant sea anemone (Condylactis gigantea) responses
   to disturbance across a continuous habitat gradient to determine whether
   anemones' habitat selection is explained by individual variation. On
   four different occasions we induced individual anemones to retract their
   tentacles by touching them with a model blue crab (Callinectes sapidus)
   and recorded the time for their tentacles to relax into their original
   state. We also recorded several environmental variables associated with
   each anemone. We found that individual anemones behaved in consistently
   different ways and that a combination of seagrass measurements and the
   number of close conspecifics, as well as their tentacle color,
   significantly explained this variation. This indicates that personality
   may either influence habitat choice, or that habitats favor certain
   personalities. Ultimately, personality types are segregated by habitat
   type, which suggests that such variation could lead to reproductive
   isolation.. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individual behaviors of animals do not evolve separately; they do so in
   association with other behaviors caused by single shared genetic or
   physiological constraints and/or favored by selection. Thus, measuring
   behavioral syndromes-suites of correlated behaviors across different
   contexts-leads to a better understanding of the adaptive significance of
   variations in behaviors. However, relatively few studies have examined
   behavioral syndromes in wild animal populations in changing
   environments. We investigated a potential behavioral syndrome across
   antipredator nest defense, territorial defense, chick provisioning, and
   mating behaviors of male Black-tailed Gulls Larus crassirostris in two
   successive years under different conspecific territorial intrusion risks
   and food conditions. Males that presented high levels of antipredator
   nest defense (aggressive antipredator defenders) against a crow decoy
   (crows are egg predators) defended their territories against conspecific
   intruders more frequently than did other males (nonaggressive
   antipredator defenders), independent of the risk of intrusion.
   Aggressive antipredator defenders also fed their chicks more frequently
   than nonaggressive males, but only in a year of low food availability.
   Taken together, this indicates that males show consistent aggressiveness
   regardless of breeding context (antipredator and territorial defense),
   but can regulate food provisioning according to food availability.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in exploratory behaviour have been shown to be
   consistent across contexts and suggested to be part of behavioural
   syndromes in a diversity of species, including fish. Exploration has
   also been shown to be a key factor in understanding complex ecological
   processes such as sexual selection and cooperation. Another important
   question in ecology is why animals breed in colonies. Exploration
   syndromes, by affecting prospecting behaviour, dispersal and public
   information use may also contribute to our understanding of coloniality.
   This study aims at investigating whether an exploration syndrome exists
   in a colonial fish species, Neolamprologus caudopunctatus. Individuals
   of this species were subjected to two consecutive tests, a novel
   environment and a novel object test. Results show that more explorative
   individuals in a novel environment are also less neophobic in the
   presence of a novel object, suggesting that the tendency to engage with
   novelty per se is a consistent trait and part of an exploration
   syndrome. These results are discussed in light of the contribution of an
   exploration syndrome to explain colony formation in animals.}},

Abstract = {{Many aspects of an animal's early development contribute to the
   emergence of individual differences in physiology. Here we asked whether
   litter size, birth mass, suckling success and postnatal growth were
   predictors of individual differences in testosterone (T) and
   corticosterone (CORT) levels in neonatal domestic rabbits. Serum
   concentrations of both hormones, which we measured on postnatal day 8,
   were significantly and positively correlated with pup growth and milk
   intake. Litter size and birth mass were not significantly correlated
   with levels of T and CORT, although both parameters were indirectly
   associated with the levels of these hormones via their effects on milk
   intake and pup growth. Our results highlight the importance of naturally
   occurring features of the postnatal environment in shaping individual
   differences in T and CORT levels during early life. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study of personality is well established in human psychology, with
   trait theory being perhaps the most widely accepted of the personality
   theories. Animal personality research has utilized trait theory to
   identify personality factors in a wide variety of animal species.
   However, it has been somewhat hampered by attempting to apply human
   personality dimensions to animals rather than investigating the depth
   and breadth of personality in individual animal species. Research into
   animal personality offers human personality researchers the chance to
   explore the evolution and development of human personality. This can
   best be done by exploring the expression of personality in other species
   without restriction to human personality models. This paper suggests
   that the dog, Canis familiaris, is a suitable species to begin with
   because of its unique place in human society, its history and
   familiarity with humans, and its genetic plasticity. A potential
   structure of canine personality is proposed.}},

Volume = {{373}},
Number = {{1756}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, several conceptual papers have linked variation in
   animal personality to variation in cognition, and recent years have seen
   a flood of empirical studies testing this link. However, these results
   have not been synthesized in a quantitative way. Here, we systematically
   search the literature and conduct a phylogenetically controlled
   meta-analysis of empirical papers that have tested the relationship
   between animal personality (exploration, boldness, activity, aggression
   and sociability) and cognition (initial learning/reversal speed, number
   of correct choices/errors after standard training). We find evidence for
   a small but significant relationship between variation in personality
   and variation in learning across species in the absolute scale; however,
   the direction of this relationship is highly variable and when both
   positive and negative effect sizes are considered, the average effect
   size does not differ significantly from zero. Importantly, this
   variation among studies is not explained by differences in personality
   or learning measure, or taxonomic grouping. Further, these results do
   not support current hypotheses suggesting that that fast-explorers are
   fast-learners or that slow-explorers perform better on tests of reversal
   learning. Rather, we find evidence that bold animals are faster
   learners, but only when boldness is measured in response to a predator
   (or simulated predator) and not when boldness is measured by exposure to
   a novel object (or novel food). Further, although only a small
   sub-sample of papers reported results separately for males and females,
   sex explained a significant amount of variation in effect size. These
   results, therefore, suggest that, while personality and learning are
   indeed related across a range of species, the direction of this
   relationship is highly variable. Thus further empirical work is needed
   to determine whether there are important moderators of this
   relationship.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Causes and consequences of
   individual differences in cognitive abilities'.}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (i.e., POLS) hypothesis posits that behavioral
   and physiological traits mediate the trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. This hypothesis predicts that life history,
   behavioral, and physiological traits will covary under clearly defined
   conditions. Empirical tests are equivocal and suggest that the
   conditions necessary for the POLS to emerge are not always met. We
   nuance and expand the POLS hypothesis to consider alternative
   relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history. These
   relationships will vary with the nature of predation risk, the
   challenges posed by resource acquisition, and the energy management
   strategies of organisms. We also discuss how the plastic response of
   behavior, physiology, and life history to changes in ecological
   conditions and variation in resource acquisition among individuals
   determine our ability to detect a fast-slow pace of life in the first
   place or associations among these traits. Future empirical studies will
   provide most insights on the coevolution among behavior, physiology, and
   life history by investigating these traits both at the genetic and
   phenotypic levels in varying types of predation regimes and levels of
   resource abundance.
   We revisit the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, suggesting that
   behaviors involving a risk of death or injury should coevolve with
   higher metabolic rates, higher fecundity, faster growth, and heightened
   mortality rates. Empirical support for this hypothesis is mixed. We show
   how relaxing some of the assumptions underlying the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis allows us to consider alternative relationships
   among behavior, physiology, and life history, and why we fail to meet
   the predictions posed by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis in some
   populations. Our discussion emphasizes the need to re-integrate the role
   of the species' natural history, ecological conditions, and phenotypic
   plasticity in shaping relationships among behavior, physiology, and life
   history.}},

Title = {{Testing the stability of behavioural coping style across stress contexts

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Within populations, individuals can vary in stress response, a
   multivariate phenomenon comprising neuroendocrine, physiological and
   behavioural traits. Verbal models of individual stress coping style have
   proposed that the behavioural component of this variation can be
   described as a single axis, with each individual's coping style being
   consistent across time and stress contexts. Focusing on this behavioural
   component of stress response and combining repeated measures of multiple
   traits with a novel multivariate modelling framework, we test for the
   existence of coping style variation and assess its stability across
   contexts in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically,
   we test the following hypotheses: (1) there exists repeatable
   among-individual behavioural (co)variation (personality) within a mild
   stress context consistent with a risk-averse-risk-prone continuum of
   behavioural coping style, (2) there is population-level plasticity in
   behaviour as a function of stressor severity, (3) there is
   among-individual variation in plasticity (i.e. IxE), and (4) the
   presence of IxE reduces cross-context stability of behavioural coping
   style. We found significant repeatable among-individual behavioural
   (co)variation in the mild stress context (open field trial), represented
   as an I matrix. However, I was not readily described by a simple
   risk-averse-risk-prone continuum as posited by the original coping style
   model. We also found strong evidence for population-level changes in
   mean behaviour with increasing stressor severity (simulated avian and
   piscine predation risks). Single-trait analyses did show the presence of
   individual-by-environment interactions (IxE), as among-individual
   cross-context correlations were significantly less than +1. However,
   multitrait analysis revealed the consequences of this plasticity
   variation were minimal. Specifically, we found little evidence for
   changes in the structure of I between mild and moderate stress contexts
   overall, and only minor changes between the two moderate contexts (avian
   vs. piscine predator). We show that a multivariate approach to assessing
   changes in among-individual (co)variance across contexts can prevent the
   over-interpretation of statistically significant, but small,
   individual-by-environment effects. While behavioural flexibility enables
   populations (and individuals) to respond rapidly to changes in the
   environment, multivariate personality structure can be conserved
   strongly across such contexts.

   explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks
   (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or
   behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of
   shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found
   evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human
   disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age.
   Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of
   individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very
   little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a
   possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of
   developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as `personality'.
   Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in
   shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of
   personality-mediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat
   choice has important implications for population management and
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{All animals experience performance trade-offs as they complete tasks
   such as capturing prey, defending territories, acquiring mates, and
   escaping predators. Why then, is it so hard to detect performance
   trade-offs at the whole-organismal level? Why do we sometimes even
   obtain positive correlations between two performance traits that are
   predicted to be negatively associated? Here we explore two plausible
   explanations. First, most analyses are based on individual maximal
   values (i.e., personal best), which could introduce a bias in the
   correlation estimates. Second, phenotypic correlations alone may be poor
   indicators of a trade-off when contrasting processes occur at the
   among-versus within-individual levels. One such scenario is the ``big
   houses big cars{''} model developed in life-history theory to explain
   the existence of ``uberfleas{''} that are superior in all regards
   (because they acquire more resources than others). We highlight that the
   exact opposite scenario might occur for performance trade-offs, where
   among-individual trade-offs may be masked by within-individual changes
   in physical condition. One of the best ways to test among these
   alternative scenarios is to collect repeated pairs of performance traits
   and analyze them using multivariate mixed models (MMMs). MMMs allow
   straightforward and simultaneous examination of trait correlations at
   the among-and within-individual levels. We use a simple simulation tool
   (SQuID package in R) to create a population of Krakens, a mythical giant
   squid-like sea creature whose morphology generates a performance
   trade-off between swimming speed and strength or ability to sink ships.
   The simulations showed that using individual maximum values introduces a
   bias that is particularly severe when individuals differ in the number
   of repeated samples (n(trial)). Finally, we show how MMMs can help
   detect performance (or any other type of) trade-offs and offer
   additional insights (e.g., help detect plasticity integration). We hope
   researchers will adopt MMMs when exploring trade-offs in whole-animal
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{1. Given fundamental energetic trade-offs among growth, maintenance and
   reproduction, individual differences in energy saving should have
   consequences for survival and reproductive success. Many endotherms use
   periodic heterothermy to reduce energy and water requirements and
   individual variation in heterothermy should have fitness consequences.
   However, attempts to disentangle individual- and population-level
   variation in heterothermy are scarce. 2. Here, we quantified patterns of
   heterothermy of 55 free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus),
   food-hoarding hibernators. Over five hibernation periods, we obtained a
   total of 7108 daily individual heterothermy indices (median: 118 per
   individual). 3. Based on an individual reaction norm approach, we found
   that the use of heterothermy was repeatable and varied among individuals
   of the same population under similar environmental conditions. This
   among-individual variation had consequences for winter survival and
   reproductive success. Individuals using less heterothermy at the
   beginning of the winter had decreased survival in resource-rich but not
   in resource-poor years and higher reproductive success in the subsequent
   breeding season. 4. These results support the hypothesis that
   fluctuating selection maintains heterothermic diversity and suggest that
   individualized ecophysiology can contribute to a more thorough
   understanding of the evolution of energy-saving strategies in
   endotherms.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental heterogeneity can result in spatial variation in selection
   pressures that can produce local adaptations. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis predicts that habitat-specific selective pressures will favor
   the coevolution of personality, physiological, and life-history
   phenotypes. Few studies so far have compared these traits simultaneously
   across different ecological conditions. In this study, we compared 3
   personality traits (handling aggression, exploration speed in a novel
   environment, and nest defense behavior) and 1 physiological trait (heart
   rate during manual restraint) across 3 Corsican blue tit (Cyanistes
   caeruleus) populations. These populations are located in contrasting
   habitats (evergreen vs. deciduous) and are situated in 2 different
   valleys 25 km apart. Birds from these populations are known to differ in
   life-history characteristics, with birds from the evergreen habitat
   displaying a slow pace-of-life, and birds from the deciduous habitat a
   comparatively faster pace-of-life. We expected personality to differ
   across populations, in line with the differences in pace-of-life
   documented for life-history traits. As expected, we found behavioral
   differences among populations. Despite considerable temporal variation,
   birds exhibited lower handling aggression in the evergreen populations.
   Exploration speed and male heart rate also differed across populations,
   although our results for exploration speed were more consistent with a
   phenotypic difference between the 2 valleys than between habitats. There
   were no clear differences in nest defense intensity among populations.
   Our study emphasizes the role of environmental heterogeneity in shaping
   population divergence in personality traits at a small spatial scale.}},

Title = {{Correlational selection on personality and social plasticity: morphology

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{213-226}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Despite a central line of research aimed at quantifying relationships
   between mating success and sexually dimorphic traits (e. g., ornaments),
   individual variation in sexually selected traits often explains only a
   modest portion of the variation in mating success.
   2. Another line of research suggests that a significant portion of the
   variation in mating success observed in animal populations could be
   explained by correlational selection, where the fitness advantage of a
   given trait depends on other components of an individual's phenotype
   and/or its environment. We tested the hypothesis that interactions
   between multiple traits within an individual (phenotype dependence) or
   between an individual's phenotype and its social environment (context
   dependence) can select for individual differences in behaviour (i. e.,
   personality) and social plasticity.
   3. To quantify the importance of phenotype-and context-dependent
   selection on mating success, we repeatedly measured the behaviour,
   social environment and mating success of about 300 male stream water
   striders, Aquarius remigis. Rather than explaining individual
   differences in long-term mating success, we instead quantified how the
   combination of a male's phenotype interacted with the immediate social
   context to explain variation in hour-by-hour mating decisions. We
   suggest that this analysis captures more of the mechanisms leading to
   differences in mating success.
   4. Males differed consistently in activity, aggressiveness and social
   plasticity. The mating advantage of these behavioural traits depended on
   male morphology and varied with the number of rival males in the pool,
   suggesting mechanisms selecting for consistent differences in behaviour
   and social plasticity. Accounting for phenotype and context dependence
   improved the amount of variation in male mating success we explained
   statistically by 30-274\%.
   5. Our analysis of the determinants of male mating success provides
   important insights into the evolutionary forces that shape phenotypic
   variation. In particular, our results suggest that sexual selection is
   likely to favour individual differences in behaviour, social plasticity
   (i. e., individuals adjusting their behaviour), niche preference (i. e.,
   individuals dispersing to particular social conditions) or social niche
   construction (i. e., individuals modifying the social environment). The
   true effect of sexual traits can only be understood in interaction with
   the individual's phenotype and environment.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the two main evolutionary hypotheses for an association
   between immunity and personality. The risk of-parasitism hypothesis
   predicts that more proactive (bold, exploratory, risk-taking)
   individuals have more vigorous immune defenses because of increased risk
   of parasite exposure. In contrast, the pace-of-life hypothesis argues
   that proactive behavioral styles are associated with shorter lifespans
   and reduced investment in immune function. Mechanistically, associations
   between immunity and personality can arise because personality
   differences are often associated with differences in condition and
   stress responsiveness, both of which are intricately linked with
   immunity. Here we investigate the association between personality
   (measured as proactive exploration of a novel environment) and three
   indices of innate immune function (the non-specific first line of
   defense against parasites) in wild superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus.
   We also quantified body condition, hemoparasites (none detected),
   chronic stress (heterophil:lymphocyte ratio) and circulating
   corticosterone levels at the end of the behavioral test (CORT, in a
   subset of birds). We found that fast explorers had lower titers of
   natural antibodies. This result is consistent with the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, and with the previously documented higher mortality of fast
   explorers in this species. There was no interactive effect of
   exploration score and duration in captivity on immune indices. This
   suggests that personality-related differences in stress responsiveness
   did not underlie differences in immunity, even though behavioral style
   did modulate the effect of captivity on CORT. Taken together these
   results suggest reduced constitutive investment in innate immune
   function in more proactive individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Animals typically display among-individual differences in behavior that
   are consistent over time (i.e., personality). These differences are
   often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress
   factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and
   risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are
   considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown
   whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main
   sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested
   whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of
   Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific
   competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic
   and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences
   in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was
   manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile
   individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The
   emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral
   plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior
   among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal
   personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under
   laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors
   that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of
   behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for
   the development of personality in animals.
   Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is,
   individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold
   and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences
   among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often
   caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this
   study, we observed that personality differences were not present at
   juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the
   fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition
   for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences
   strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual
   behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that the decline in
   behavioral plasticity with age may represent a relevant mechanism for
   behavioral differentiation in animals, in agreement with evidences from
   the human literature on age-related loss in behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, investigators have documented individual
   differences in many different types of behavioral plasticity. Of
   particular interest are individual differences in the temporal
   plasticity of personality traits over extended (ontogenetic) periods of
   time, because of the relevance of these data to models of behavioral
   development. We discuss recent empirical studies of the temporal
   consistency of personality over ontogeny, and models that make
   contrasting predictions about individual differences in the
   developmental trajectories of behavioral traits. In addition, we
   consider recent advances in studies of relationships between personality
   traits and particular types of behavioral plasticity, including
   statistical methods which facilitate analyses of relationships between
   personality traits, contextual plasticity, temporal plasticity and
   intraindividual variability, and empirical tests of predicted
   relationships between personality traits and other types of behavioral
   plasticity (flexibility, learning rates). As the field of animal
   personality and behavioral plasticity moves from a largely descriptive
   to a predictive phase, we suggest that there is ample room for empirical
   tests of recent models that predict individual differences in behavioral
   developmental trajectories, and for the development of new formal models
   that make strong predictions about relationships between personality
   traits and specific types of behavioral plasticity.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{3-10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many animals show complex behaviours that can have important ecological
   and evolutionary consequences. Environmental variation can lead to
   divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in
   different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal
   behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions
   remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different
   levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable
   population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components
   of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and
   exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence
   for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish,
   Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled
   caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in
   either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish
   behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between
   predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability
   and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to
   high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex
   dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed
   reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did
   not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a
   behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive
   stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural
   syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar
   predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using
   laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that
   exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant
   within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental
   variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and
   often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that
   various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of
   one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours,
   the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world
   could serve as a valuable conservation tool. (C) 2016 The Association

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{553-559}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation in behavior has largely been neglected by
   community ecologists to date. Recently, however, a number of studies
   demonstrated that intraspecific variation can have profound consequences
   for species interactions and thereby alter community dynamics in
   solitary organisms. Here, we study how intraspecific variation in
   collective behaviors (also called ``collective personalities{''})
   affects the outcome of resource contests between 2 co-occurring species
   of ants, Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. Our results
   revealed that intraspecific variation in colonies' exploration behavior
   and aggressiveness predicts the outcome of interspecific contests for
   food and nest sites. How exploratory behavior affected the outcome of
   the foraging and nest site contests depended on the species: exploratory
   behavior seemed to enhance performance in foraging contests in T.
   curvispinosus but diminish it in T. longispinosus. More interestingly,
   whether a species was successful in nest site contests depended not only
   on its collective personality but also on the personality of its
   opponent colony. Temnothorax longispinosus experienced greater success
   if its opponent colony had similar exploratory tendencies to its own. In
   contrast, T. curvispinosus performed best when its opponent colony
   exhibited a contrasting exploratory tendency to its own. Our data
   demonstrate that intraspecific variation in colony behavior can have
   consequences for contest outcomes and ensure that no one species or
   behavioral strategy consistently experiences superior success. This, in
   turn, might help to maintain variation in collective behavior in
   multiple interacting populations and prevent competitive exclusion of
   one of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal parents invest heavily to ensure offspring survival, yet
   some eventually consume some or all of their very own young. This
   so-called filial cannibalism is known from a wide range of taxa, but its
   adaptive benefit remains largely unclear. The extent to which parents
   cannibalize their broods varies substantially not only between species,
   but also between individuals, indicating that intrinsic behavioral
   differences, or animal personalities, might constitute a relevant
   proximate trigger for filial cannibalism. Using a marine fish with
   extensive paternal care, the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps), we
   investigated the influence of animal personality on filial cannibalism
   by assessing (1) behavioral consistency across a breeding and a
   nonbreeding context; (2) correlations between different breeding (egg
   fanning; filial cannibalism) and nonbreeding (activity) behaviors, and,
   in a separate experiment; (3) whether previously established personality
   scores affect filial cannibalism levels. We found consistent individual
   differences in activity across contexts. Partial filial cannibalism was
   independent of egg fanning but correlated strongly with activity, where
   active males cannibalized more eggs than less active males. This pattern
   was strong initially but vanished as the breeding season progressed. The
   incidence of whole clutch filial cannibalism increased with activity and
   clutch size. Our findings indicate that filial cannibalism cannot
   generally be adjusted independently of male personality and is thus
   phenotypically less plastic than typically assumed. The present work
   stresses the multidimensional interaction between animal personality,
   individual plasticity and the environment in shaping filial cannibalism.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the variation in behaviour-related genes within and between
   populations provides insight into how evolutionary processes shape
   consistent behavioural traits (i.e. personality). Deliberate
   introductions of non-native species offer opportunities to investigate
   how such genes differ between native and introduced populations and how
   polymorphisms in the genes are related to variation in behaviour. Here,
   we compared the genetic variation of the two personality' genes, DRD4
   and SERT, between a native (United Kingdom, UK) and an introduced (New
   Zealand, NZ) population of dunnocks, Prunella modularis. The NZ
   population showed a significantly lower number of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the UK population. Standardized F'(st)
   estimates of the personality genes and neutral microsatellites indicate
   that selection (anthropogenic and natural) probably occurred during and
   post the introduction event. Notably, the largest genetic
   differentiation was found in the intronic regions of the genes. In the
   NZ population, we also examined the association between polymorphisms in
   DRD4 and SERT and two highly repeatable behavioural traits:
   flight-initiation distance and mating status (promiscuous females and
   cobreeding males). We found 38 significant associations (for different
   allele effect models) between the two behavioural traits and the studied
   genes. Further, 22 of the tested associations showed antagonistic allele
   effects for males and females. Our findings illustrate how introduction
   events and accompanying ecological changes could influence the genetic
   diversity of behaviour-related genes.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{154-161}},

Abstract = {{Stereotypic behaviours, which are abnormal, repetitive and invariant
   behaviours caused by frustration and/or central nervous system
   dysfunction, develop as a result of sub-optimal captive conditions that
   provide inadequate motor and sensory stimulation. However, not all
   individuals housed under such conditions develop stereotypic behaviours.
   One hypothesis to explain such variation is personality (i.e.
   individual) differences. We tested this hypothesis in the African
   striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus and predicted that stereotypic
   individuals would have a bolder personality and a proactive coping style
   than non-stereotypic individuals. We conducted two experiments. In the
   first experiment, adult stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice
   were tested for their personality using three tests (i.e. light-dark,
   startle-response and novel-object tests). Subsequently, we recorded the
   behaviours of individuals every second day for 30 days in standard
   laboratory housing. Stereotypic striped mice were proactive and showed a
   bolder personality type by spending longer time in the light compartment
   after a startle response, showed greater manipulation of cage objects
   and were more active than non-stereotypic individuals in standard
   housing. In the second experiment, we tested the personality of juvenile
   striped mice before the onset of stereotypic behaviours. Again, the
   startle response test correlated with the onset of stereotypic behaviour
   in adults, with stereotypic mice that spent more time in the light
   compartment (i.e. bolder) showing a greater likelihood of displaying
   stereotypic behaviours later. Although our data provides support for the
   association between personality and stereotypic behaviour, these
   group-level effects (stereotypic vs. non-stereotypic) were not evident
   at the individual level, particularly for stereotypic mice. Therefore,
   having a proactive coping style did not predict the onset of stereotypic
   behaviour for all stereotypic individuals, highlighting individual
   trajectories for the development of stereotypic behaviours. (C) 2015

   hatchling snakes}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{313-323}},
Abstract = {{An animal's susceptibility to risk may be partly dependent on its body
   size. But are larger individuals bolder? We assessed this question by
   measuring time to emerge from a shelter in repeated trials on hatchling
   keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii). Estimates of repeatability of
   emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality
   dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter
   sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially
   influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions.
   Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring
   size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to
   adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences
   in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link
   between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger
   offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as
   well as morphology.}},

Title = {{No Association between Personality and Candidate Gene Polymorphisms in a
   Wild Bird Population}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Consistency of between-individual differences in behaviour or
   personality is a phenomenon in populations that can have ecological
   consequences and evolutionary potential. One way that behaviour can
   evolve is to have a genetic basis. Identifying the molecular genetic
   basis of personality could therefore provide insight into how and why
   such variation is maintained, particularly in natural populations.
   Previously identified candidate genes for personality in birds include
   the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), and serotonin transporter (SERT).
   Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory and bold
   behaviours are associated with polymorphisms in both DRD4 and SERT. Here
   we tested for polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT in the Seychelles warbler
   (Acrocephalus sechellensis) population on Cousin Island, Seychelles, and
   then investigated correlations between personality and polymorphisms in
   these genes. We found no genetic variation in DRD4, but identified four
   polymorphisms in SERT that clustered into five haplotypes. There was no
   correlation between bold or exploratory behaviours and SERT
   polymorphisms/haplotypes. The null result was not due to lack of power,
   and indicates that there was no association between these behaviours and
   variation in the candidate genes tested in this population. These null
   findings provide important data to facilitate representative future
   meta-analyses on candidate personality genes.}},

Abstract = {{Social foraging is common and may provide benefits of safety and public
   information. Public information permits faster and more accurate
   estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective
   foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots
   Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on
   intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red
   knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance
   status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the
   foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither
   dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the
   second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether
   public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch
   residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food
   patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's
   number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group
   size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as
   well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some
   birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We
   conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly
   increase their food-finding rate by using public information. This
   article is part of a Special Issue entitled: In Honor of Jerry Hogan.

Abstract = {{The development and persistence of personality in nature are
   counterintuitive because, in heterogeneous environments, personality is
   expected to limit the degree of behavioural flexibility. Recent work has
   shown that personality and behavioural flexibility might be linked, but
   their interaction is not well understood and could be elucidated by
   studying a socially flexible species. Using well-established tests, we
   measured the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and
   aggressiveness in free-living striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in South
   Africa. Specifically, we tested whether personality changes when
   individuals change their reproductive tactic, either from group-living
   philopatrics to solitary-living females and roaming males or from
   non-breeding philopatrics to breeders. Our results showed that striped
   mice have personalities: Individuals behaved consistently for all the
   behavioural traits measured both over time and contexts (breeding to
   non-breeding season). While most of the personality traits measured
   remained consistent among tactics, they did not predict which tactic an
   individual would adopt next, suggesting that environmental conditions
   rather than personality influence tactic switching. Additionally, we
   found important differences in the consistency of the behaviours
   measured between males and females, indicating that sexual selection
   might play a prominent role in the maintenance of personality in this
   species. Our study demonstrates that some personality traits can be
   stable over an entire lifetime even in socially flexible species and
   that personality does not constrain social flexibility.}},

   (personalities). In the ``alerting test{''} the behaviour was scored
   after the human observer lifted the cover of the tank. In the ``threat

   stick. In the ``feeding test{''} the behaviour was scored after the
   animal was given a live prey. The relationship among behavioural
   responses was analysed by principal component analysis, which allowed
   identifying three dimensions along which individual differences were
   maximal, accounting for 39.6, 15.6, and 10.3\% of the total variance. We
   found marked individual differences that were consistent across the
   three tests with respect to behaviours such as floating, staying at the
   bottom of the tank, and moving the fins. However, behaviours such as
   ``moving{''} and ``changes in body patterning{''} showed
   context-dependent variation. This study provides evidence of personality
   dimensions in cuttlefish with implications about welfare of cephalopods
   used in research in view of the new EU regulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Frequency-dependent selection is thought to be a major contributor to
   the maintenance of phenotypic variation. We tested for
   frequency-dependent selection on contrasting behavioural strategies,
   termed here personalities', in three species of social spiders, each
   thought to represent an independent evolutionary origin of sociality.
   The evolution of sociality in the spider genus Anelosimus is
   consistently met with the emergence of two temporally stable discrete
   personality types: an aggressive' or docile' form. We assessed how the
   foraging success of each phenotype changes as a function of its
   representation within a colony. We did this by creating experimental
   colonies of various compositions (six aggressives, three aggressives and
   three dociles, one aggressive and five dociles, six dociles),
   maintaining them in a common garden for 3weeks, and tracking the mass
   gained by individuals of either phenotype. We found that both the docile
   and aggressive phenotypes experienced their greatest mass gain in mixed
   colonies of mostly docile individuals. However, the performance of both
   phenotypes decreased as the frequency of the aggressive phenotype
   increased. Nearly identical patterns of phenotype-specific frequency
   dependence were recovered in all three species. Naturally occurring
   colonies of these spiders exhibit mixtures dominated by the docile
   phenotype, suggesting that these spiders may have evolved mechanisms to
   maintain the compositions that maximize the success of the colony
   without compromising the expected reproductive output of either
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{The recent growth of research on animal personality could provide new
   insights into our understanding of sociality and the structure of animal
   groups. Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal
   personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in
   some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it
   clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict
   behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of
   a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and
   performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals:
   tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a
   variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger
   individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness
   were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related
   to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to
   capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and
   we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results,
   such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups
   rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species
   being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality
   assays that test individuals alone.}},

Title = {{Nestling activity levels during begging behaviour predicts activity
   level and body mass in adulthood}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Across a range of species including humans, personality traits, or
   differences in behaviour between individuals that are consistent over
   time, have been demonstrated. However, few studies have measured whether
   these consistent differences are evident in very young animals, and
   whether they persist over an individual's entire lifespan. Here we
   investigated the begging behaviour of very young cross-fostered zebra
   finch nestlings and the relationship between that and adult activity
   levels. We found a link between the nestling activity behaviour head
   movements during begging, measured at just five and seven days after
   hatching, and adult activity levels, measured when individuals were
   between three and three and a half years old. Moreover, body mass was
   found to be negatively correlated with both nestling and adult activity
   levels, suggesting that individuals which carry less body fat as adults
   are less active both as adults and during begging as nestlings. Our work
   suggests that the personality traits identified here in both very young
   nestlings and adults may be linked to physiological factors such as
   metabolism or environmental sources of variation. Moreover, our work
   suggests it may be possible to predict an individual's future adult
   personality at a very young age, opening up new avenues for future work
   to explore the relationship between personality and a number of aspects
   of individual life history and survival.}},

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{65-71}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities can play an important role in how individuals deal
   with specific social situations, which may have important fitness
   consequences. A link between personality and social skills seems obvious
   from a human perspective and it is therefore surprising that relatively
   few studies have looked at the effect of animal personality on
   communicative interactions. In this study we tested the evidence for
   personality-related variation in birds during vocal interactions in the
   field. We scored individual variation in exploratory behaviour of great
   tits, Parus major, in repeated trials of a novel environment test in the
   laboratory and related this score to approach and vocal behaviour in
   response to playback of conspecific songs in the field. Contrary to our
   expectation, we found males with low exploration scores approached the
   speaker more closely than birds with high exploration scores. Birds with
   high exploration scores seemed to respond less aggressively while
   dealing with the simulated intruder vocally by switching song types more
   often. Our results suggest that slow-exploring birds in the laboratory
   respond more strongly during natural interactions in the field. An
   independent and very similar study also revealed a correlation between
   personality score and playback response, but with a seemingly
   contrasting outcome. A comparison of the two studies provides insights
   into the complexity of interpreting playback results and territorial
   response patterns in general. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Boldness and Stress Responsiveness as Drivers of Nest-Site Selection in
   a Ground-Nesting Bird}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nest-site selection involves trade-offs between the probability of nest
   discovery by egg predators, danger to the incubating parent from
   predators and provision of an appropriate microclimate for incubation,
   and all three components are potentially influenced by nest concealment
   and distance to habitat edge. Personality traits also affect habitat
   choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable
   stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize
   either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping),
   both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this
   hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks
   (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with
   attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further
   away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential
   expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this
   prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition
   and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses
   and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their
   repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the
   clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our
   prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation
   distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature
   were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower
   handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther
   from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at
   intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with
   increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus
   be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be
   manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary significance of individual consistency in a given
   behaviour called animal personality has been subject to a lot of recent
   research. However, the genetic underpinnings of population divergence in
   mean personality have rarely been studied, especially across different
   ontogenetic stages. Previous work has shown that marine vs. pond
   populations of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) have
   undergone adaptive divergence in a series of fitness-related traits,
   including behaviour. One particular behavioural trait important in this
   system is feeding activity: giant pond sticklebacks are more active
   feeders than their normal sized marine conspecifics. In a common garden
   experiment, we raised individuals from pure and hybrid F1-generation
   crosses of a highly divergent marine pond population pair to see if (i)
   feeding activity and/or its ontogenetic change was consistent between
   individuals, and if (ii) population divergence at different ontogenetic
   stages could be explained by additive genetic, nonadditive genetic or
   maternal effects. We found that feeding activity decreased with age, but
   that these changes were consistently different among both individuals
   and crosses. The among cross patterns were consistent with a nonadditive
   genetic scenario: in the early period pond sticklebacks expressed
   dominance for high feeding activity, while in the late period marine
   sticklebacks expressed dominance for low feeding activity. We conclude
   that nine-spined sticklebacks exhibit different feeding personalities,
   and that the population divergence in feeding personality is explainable
   by age-dependent expression of genetic dominance.}},

Title = {{Variation in Female Grey Seal (Halichoerus grypus) Reproductive
   Performance Correlates to Proactive-Reactive Behavioural Types}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, indicative of
   behavioural types or personalities, have been shown in taxa ranging from
   Cnidaria to Mammalia. However, despite numerous theoretical explanations
   there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that
   maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined
   behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the
   North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a
   remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to
   females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested
   twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual
   pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of
   undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics
   or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour.
   However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking
   rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the
   auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to
   which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to
   disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from
   proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive
   females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test.
   Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater
   among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of
   more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the
   long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by
   other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a
   mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity,
   physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup
   activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
   variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal
   environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment
   matching.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species exhibit behavioural syndromes, groups of two or more
   behaviours that are linked together across different environments or
   time points. Behavioural syndromes give rise to stable behavioural
   profiles and have been likened to personality in humans. However, the
   proximate causes (or mechanisms) that underlie the clustering of
   behaviour are not well understood. In this review, we examine the
   proximate causes of the aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, which
   constitutes a positive correlation between aggression, boldness and
   exploratory activity. In particular, we will focus on novel insights
   that have been gained from zebrafish, a genetically tractable
   behavioural model which can be used to study the mechanistic basis of
   behaviour. Studies of the proximate causes of behavioural syndromes
   provide us with the opportunity to understand the clustering of
   behaviours - and perhaps even the basis of personality - at the
   molecular level. Thus, this exciting field not only promises to bring
   novel insights into animal behaviour, but also forces us to rethink our
   own personalities as well.}},

Abstract = {{While differences in individual personality are common in animal
   populations, understanding the ecological significance of variation has
   not yet been resolved. Evidence suggests that personality may influence
   learning and memory; a finding that could improve our understanding of
   the evolutionary processes that produce and maintain intraspecific
   behavioural heterogeneity. Here, we tested whether boldness, the most
   studied personality trait in fish, could predict learning ability in
   brook trout. After quantifying boldness, fish were trained to find a
   hidden food patch in a maze environment. Stable landmark cues were
   provided to indicate the location of food and, at the conclusion of
   training, cues were rearranged to test for learning. There was a
   negative relationship between boldness and learning as shy fish were
   increasingly more successful at navigating the maze and locating food
   during training trials compared to bold fish. In the altered testing
   environment, only shy fish continued using cues to search for food.
   Overall, the learning rate of bold fish was found to be lower than that
   of shy fish for several metrics suggesting that personality could have
   widespread effects on behaviour. Because learning can increase
   plasticity to environmental change, these results have significant
   implications for fish conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are correlations between behavioral traits, but
   their selective advantage under different environmental conditions is
   not well understood. Here, we used the pace-of-life hypothesis to
   predict how behavioral syndromes could vary along climatic gradients.
   This hypothesis states that populations experiencing different
   ecological conditions should differ in suites of physiological
   characteristics associated with behavioral and life-history traits. We
   examined the persistence of behavioral syndromes at multiple levels in
   the ant Temnothorax longispinosus along a climatic gradient in
   north-eastern USA. ``Across populations{''}, we predicted that proactive
   phenotypes, which show higher activity, aggression and exploration, are
   more likely to persist in warmer climates. ``Within populations{''}, we
   expected positive associations among proactive behaviors to be more
   pronounced at warmer sites. Additionally, we measured colony
   productivity to test whether deviation from the population-level
   syndrome influences their success, and whether such deviations could
   vary among populations. Behavioral syndromes clearly occurred across
   populations, with colonies from warmer environments exhibiting more
   exploration and foraging but slightly less aggressiveness than colonies
   from colder sites. However, the presence of behavioral syndromes within
   sites was population-specific. Positive associations between foraging,
   exploration and aggression, albeit rarely found, were more pronounced at
   the warmest sites, whereas negative associations were more common at
   colder sites. Furthermore, colonies from colder environments showed
   higher syndrome deviations than colonies from warmer environments, which
   may be linked to resource limitation and may also negatively affect
   colony productivity. This study partially corroborates the pace-of-life
   hypothesis and yields insights into the adaptive value of behavioral
   syndromes along climatic gradients.}},

Title = {{Learning from the mistakes of others: How female elk (Cervus elaphus)
   adjust behaviour with age to avoid hunters}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{In animal behaviour, there is a dichotomy between innate behaviours (e.
   g., temperament or personality traits) versus those behaviours shaped by
   learning. Innate personality traits are supposedly less evident in
   animals when confounded by learning acquired with experience through
   time. Learning might play a key role in the development and adoption of
   successful anti-predator strategies, and the related adaptation has the
   potential to make animals that are more experienced less vulnerable to
   predation. We carried out a study in a system involving a large
   herbivorous mammal, female elk, Cervus elaphus, and their primary
   predator, i. e., human hunters. Using fine-scale satellite telemetry
   relocations, we tested whether differences in behaviour depending on age
   were due solely to selection pressure imposed by human hunters, meaning
   that females that were more cautious were more likely to survive and
   become older. Or whether learning also was involved, meaning that
   females adjusted their behaviour as they aged. Our results indicated
   that both human selection and learning contributed to the adoption of
   more cautious behavioural strategies in older females. Whereas human
   selection of behavioural traits has been shown in our previous research,
   we here provide evidence of additive learning processes being
   responsible for shaping the behaviour of individuals in this population.
   Female elk are indeed almost invulnerable to human hunters when older
   than 9 +/- 10 y. o., confirming that experience contributes to their
   survival. Female elk monitored in our study showed individually changing
   behaviours and clear adaptation as they aged, such as reduced movement
   rates (decreased likelihood of encountering human hunters), and
   increased use of secure areas (forest and steeper terrain), especially
   when close to roads. We also found that elk adjusted behaviours
   depending on the type of threat (bow and arrow vs. rifle hunters). This
   fine-tuning by elk to avoid hunters, rather than just becoming more
   cautious during the hunting season, highlights the behavioural
   plasticity of this species. Selection on behavioural traits and/or
   behavioural shifts via learning are an important but often-ignored
   consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Such information is a
   critical component of the effects of human exploitation of wildlife
   populations with implications for improving their management and
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the factors that promote the success of biological invasions
   is a key pursuit in ecology. To date, the link between animal
   personality and invasiveness has rarely been studied. Here, we examined
   in the laboratory how Argentine ant populations from the species' native
   and introduced ranges differed in a suite of behaviours related to
   species interactions and the use of space. We found correlations among
   specific behavioural traits that defined an explorative-aggressive
   syndrome. The Main ``European{''} supercolony (introduced range) more
   readily explored novel environments, displayed more aggression, detected
   food resources more quickly, and occupied more space than the Catalonian
   supercolony (introduced range) and two other Argentine supercolonies
   (native range). The two native supercolonies also differed in their
   personalities; one harbouring the less invasive personality, while the
   other is intermediate between the two introduced supercolonies.
   Therefore, instead of a binary pattern, Argentine ant supercolonies
   display a behavioural continuum that is independent on their geographic
   origin (native/introduced ranges). Our results also suggest that
   variability in personality traits is correlated to differences in the
   ecological success of Argentine ant colonies. Differences in group
   personalities may facilitate the persistence and invasion of animals
   under novel selective pressures by promoting adaptive behaviours. We
   stress that the concept of animal personality should be taken into
   account when elucidating the mechanisms of invasiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the recent interest in animal personality and behavioral
   syndromes, there is a paucity of explanations for why distinct
   behavioral traits should evolve to correlate. We investigate whether
   such correlations across apparently distinct behavioral traits may be
   explained by variation in life history strategy among individual ant
   colonies. Life history theory predicts that the way in which individuals
   allocate energy towards somatic maintenance or reproduction drives
   several distinct traits in physiology, morphology, and energy use; it
   also predicts that an individual's willingness to engage in risky
   behaviors should depend on reproductive strategy.
   We use Temnothorax ants, which have been shown to exhibit
   `personalities' and a syndrome that may reflect risk tolerance at the
   colony level. We measure colonies' relative investment in growth rate
   (new workers produced) compared to reproductive effort (males and queens
   produced). Comparing sterile worker production to reproductive alate
   production provides a direct measure of how colonies are investing their
   energy, analogous to investment in growth versus reproduction in a
   unitary organism. Consistently with this idea, we found that behavioral
   type of ant colonies was associated with their life history strategy:
   risk-tolerant colonies grew faster and invested more in reproduction,
   whereas risk-averse colonies had lower growth rate but invested
   relatively more in workers. This provides evidence that behavioral
   syndromes can be a consequence of life-history strategy variation,
   linking the two fields and supporting the use of an integrative
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Although personality (consistent inter-individual differences in
   behavioural traits across time and/or contexts) and behavioural
   syndromes (suites of correlated personality traits) have been widely
   studied in the last decades, the origin and development of these traits
   during ontogeny are still underexplored. In this context, species
   undergoing metamorphosis are of special interest. To date, however, the
   persistence of personality traits has been only little investigated in
   organisms undergoing complete metamorphosis such as in holometabolous
   insects, although this kind of studies may provide important insights
   from a functional point of view. Here, we tested whether the personality
   and the behavioural syndrome are maintained through metamorphosis in
   Tenebrio molitor, a holometabolous insect species. We found that
   personality and behavioural syndrome were present in both larval and
   adult stages. However, larval personality and behavioural syndrome did
   not predict adult behaviour. We suggest that the complete reorganization
   during metamorphosis may have profound effect on the behaviour of the
   beetles. These results challenge the established common thought that
   personality should persist along an individual lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge on animal personality has provided new insights into
   evolutionary biology and animal ecology, as behavioural types have been
   shown to affect fitness. Animal personality is characterized by
   repeatable and consistent between-individual behavioural differences
   throughout time and across different situations. Behavioural
   repeatability within life history stages and consistency between life
   history stages should be checked for the independence of sex and age, as
   recent data have shown that males and females in some species may differ
   in the repeatability of behavioural traits, as well as in their
   consistency. We measured the repeatability and consistency of three
   behavioural and one cognitive traits in juvenile and adult Eurasian
   harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We found that exploration, activity and
   boldness were repeatable in juveniles and adults. Spatial recognition
   measured in a Y Maze was only repeatable in adult mice. Exploration,
   activity and boldness were consistent before and after maturation, as
   well as before and after first sexual contact. Data on spatial
   recognition provided little evidence for consistency. Further, we found
   some evidence for a litter effect on behaviours by comparing different
   linear mixed models. We concluded that harvest mice express animal
   personality traits as behaviours were repeatable across sexes and
   consistent across life history stages. The tested cognitive trait showed
   low repeatability and was less consistent across life history stages.
   Given the rising interest in individual variation in cognitive
   performance, and in its relationship to animal personality, we suggest
   that it is important to gather more data on the repeatability and
   consistency of cognitive traits.}},

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Coping styles theory provides a framework for understanding individual
   variation in how animals respond to environmental change, and predicts
   how individual differences in stress responsiveness and behavior might
   relate to cognitive differences. According to coping styles theory,
   proactive individuals are bolder, less reactive to stressors, and more
   routinized than their reactive counterparts. A key tenet of coping
   styles theory is that variation in coping styles is maintained by
   tradeoffs with behavioral flexibility: proactive individuals excel in
   stable environments while more flexible, reactive individuals perform
   better in variable environments. Here, we assess evidence for coping
   styles within a natural population of threespined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We developed a criterion-based learning
   paradigm to evaluate individual variation in initial and reversal
   learning. We observed strong individual differences in boldness,
   cortisol production, and learning performance. Consistent with coping
   styles, fish that released more cortisol were more timid in response to
   a predator attack and slower to learn a color discrimination task.
   However, there was no evidence that reactive individuals performed
   better when the environment changed (when the rewarded color was
   reversed). The failure to detect trade-offs between behavioral
   routinization and flexibility prompts other explanations for the
   maintenance of differing coping styles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In human psychological research, personality traits as well as cognitive
   traits are usually validated for both, their stability over time and
   contexts. While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically
   fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to
   reveal linkages or trade - offs. In animals, these validations have
   widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested
   guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique
   pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in
   each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality
   traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The
   animals did not learn to ``always choose the larger item{''} in the
   cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each
   stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four
   slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was
   significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A
   stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and
   learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a
   correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be
   connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are
   both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will
   hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive
   traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the
   interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel
   which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence
   improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual
   differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Personality exists in non-human animals and can impact fitness. There
   is, however, a shortage of empirical studies in certain areas within the
   field, and fundamental evolutionary theory on personality remains
   largely untested. For example, little is known on how variation in
   personality is maintained over evolutionary time. Theory suggests that
   fluctuating selection pressures due to spatiotemporal variation in
   conditions, e.g. food availability, is a possible mechanism and a few
   studies have shown that the success of different personality types
   varies with spatiotemporal conditions. However, it remains unknown
   whether different mechanisms can maintain personality within a species.
   Here we use a reintroduction programme for the critically endangered
   European mink (Mustela lutreola) to test whether multiple personality
   trait domains (boldness, exploration and sociability) affected survival
   in two different years and islands. This was done through pre-release
   personality tests and post-release radio-tracking monitoring. Survival
   was positively correlated with boldness, whereas the relationship with
   exploration was either negative or positive depending on year/island.
   The results show a complex relationship between personality and survival
   and suggest that exploration can be maintained over evolutionary time
   via spatiotemporal variation in conditions. However, in contrast to
   exploration, boldness did not vary spatiotemporally and sociability had
   no impact on survival. This indicates that different personality trait
   domains might be maintained by different mechanisms. To date,
   personality has been studied primarily within behavioural sciences, but
   through empirical findings we highlight the importance of personality
   also in ecology and conservation biology.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis for behavioral
   variation, the effects of the developmental environment on the
   maintenance and generation of behavioral variation across multiple
   traits remain poorly resolved. We investigated how nutritional status
   during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between
   activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence
   in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile
   crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development,
   throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified
   open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3
   weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or
   response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the
   2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence
   was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet
   versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their
   response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting
   negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our
   results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are
   not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic
   link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and
   that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent
   behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our
   results demonstrate that subtle differences in the quality of the
   environment experienced early in life can influence how individuals
   negotiate behavioral and life-history trade-offs later in life.}},

Abstract = {{Low social status is frequently associated with heightened exposure to
   social stressors and altered glucocorticoid regulation by the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, personality
   differences can affect how individuals behave in response to social
   conditions, and thus may aggravate or protect against the effects of low
   status on HPA function. Disentangling the relative importance of
   personality from the effects of the social environment on the HPA axis
   has been challenging, since social status can predict aspects of
   behavior, and both can remain stable across the lifespan. To do so here,
   we studied an animal model of social status and social behavior, the
   rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). We performed two sequential
   experimental manipulations of dominance rank (i.e., social status) in 45
   adult females, allowing us to characterize personality and
   glucocorticoid regulation (based on sensitivity to the exogenous
   glucocorticoid dexamethasone) in each individual while she occupied two
   different dominance ranks. We identified two behavioral characteristics,
   termed `social approachability' and `boldness,' which were highly social
   status-dependent. Social approachability and a third dimension,
   anxiousness, were also associated with cortisol dynamics in low status
   females, suggesting that behavioral tendencies may sensitize individuals
   to the effects of low status on HPA axis function. Finally, we found
   that improvements in dominance rank increased dexamethasone-induced
   acute cortisol suppression and glucocorticoid negative feedback. Our
   findings indicate that social status causally affects both behavioral
   tendencies and glucocorticoid regulation, and that some behavioral
   tendencies also independently affect cortisol levels, beyond the effects
   of rank. Together, they highlight the importance of considering
   personality and social status together when investigating their effects
   on HPA axis function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Complex contests and the influence of aggressiveness in pigs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animal contests vary greatly in behavioural tactics used and intensity
   reached, with some encounters resolved without physical contact while
   others escalate to damaging fighting. However, the reasons for such
   variation remains to be fully explained. Aggressiveness, in terms of a
   personality trait, offers a potentially important source of variation
   that has typically been overlooked. Therefore, we studied how
   aggressiveness as a personality trait influenced escalation between
   contestants matched for resource-holding potential (RHP), using detailed
   observations of the contest behaviour, contest dynamics and escalation
   levels. We predicted that winner and loser behaviour would differ
   depending on personality. This was tested by examining 52 dyadic
   contests between pigs, Sus scrofa. Aggressiveness was assayed in
   resident-intruder tests prior to the contest. Contests were then staged
   between pigs matched for RHP in terms of body weight but differing in
   their aggressiveness. In 27\% of the contests a winner emerged without
   escalated physical fighting, demonstrating that a fight is not a
   prerequisite between RHP-matched contestants. However, the duration of
   contests with or without fighting was the same. In contests without a
   fight, opponents spent more time on mutual investigation and noncontact
   displays such as parallel walking, which suggests that ritualized
   display may facilitate assessment and decision making. Winners low in
   aggressiveness invested more time in opponent investigation and display
   and showed substantially less aggression towards the loser after its
   retreat compared to aggressive winners. Aggressiveness influenced
   contest dynamics but did not predict the level of escalation. Prominent
   behavioural differences were found for the interaction between
   personality and outcome and we therefore recommend including this
   interaction in models where personality is considered. Analyses based on
   contest duration only would miss many of the subtleties shown here and
   we therefore encourage more detailed analyses of animal contests,
   irrespective of the level of contest escalation. (C) 2016 The

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Territoriality is only profitable when the benefits gained from
   territory exploitation exceed the costs of defence, and territory sizes
   are usually optimized by time constraints related to resource defence
   (e.g. patrolling) and exploitation. In this study, we equipped 25
   dominant Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) with GPS units to study spatial
   movement patterns both on land and in water in relation to territory
   size, resource availability, the number of neighbours, season, and the
   beavers' age. We show a territory size dependent trade-off between
   territorial behaviours and foraging distances: Beavers in larger
   territories moved greater distances each night, thereby spending more
   time patrolling, and stayed closer to the shoreline when being on land
   (i.e. when foraging). Inversely, in smaller territories beavers
   patrolled less and foraged further away from the shoreline. These
   results suggest that individuals trade-off the costs of patrolling
   larger territories against the benefits of foraging closer towards the
   shoreline. Smaller territories might be more prone to resource
   depletion, thus, making foraging further from the shoreline a strategy
   to ensure sustainable resource use. Further, older beavers spent more
   time on land and close to territory borders compared to younger ones,
   suggesting a behavioural change with age possibly due to increased
   experience and boldness. (C) 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft flir

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates, darker individuals are often found to be more active and
   willing to take risks (representing characteristics of a proactive'
   coping style), whereas lighter individuals are instead more cautious and
   less active (representing characteristics of a reactive' coping style).
   It is thus generally expected that melanin-based coloration and
   proactivity form a suite of positively integrated traits at the
   among-individual level. Here, we use a multigenerational pedigree of
   free-living great tits (Parus major) to partition variation in, and the
   correlation between, melanin-based breast stripe (tie') size and
   exploration behaviour (a proxy for coping style) into its among- and
   within-individual components. We show that both traits harbour heritable
   variation. Against predictions, tie size and speed of exploration were
   negatively correlated at the among-individual level due to the combined
   influences of permanent environmental and additive genetic effects. By
   contrast, the two traits were weakly positively correlated within
   individuals (i.e. individuals increasing in tie size after moult tended
   to become more explorative). The patterns of among-individual covariance
   were not caused by correlational selection as we found additive and
   opposite selection pressures acting on the two traits. These findings
   imply that testing hypotheses regarding the existence of a syndrome' at
   the among-individual level strictly requires variance partitioning to
   avoid inappropriate interpretations as the negative unpartitioned'
   phenotypic correlation between exploration and tie size resulted from
   counteracting effects of within- and among-individual correlations.
   Identifying sources and levels of (co)variation in phenotypic traits is
   thus critical to our understanding of biological patterns and
   evolutionary processes.}},

Abstract = {{Personality in free-living individuals has predominantly been measured
   under standardized laboratory conditions. Such measurements have been
   then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it
   remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation
   shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken
   directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African
   striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity,
   boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the
   laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether
   personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context.
   Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts.
   Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated
   with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the
   resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All
   personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical
   personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure
   personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits
   were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In
   addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours
   measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that
   the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent
   variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all
   the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific
   syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements
   of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the
   laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same
   individuals show under natural conditions.
   Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits
   of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most
   recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as
   it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects
   the variation that the same individuals would show if the same
   measurements were taken directly in their natural habitat. Here, we used
   wild African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of
   activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when
   measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. Using similar
   protocols, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and
   consistent within one context and then compared measurements across the
   two different contexts. We showed that personality measures from
   standardized laboratory conditions are consistent with field
   measurements for all personality traits considered.}},

Abstract = {{Personality differences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom and
   can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite a
   rapidly increasing body of literature, large (marine) vertebrates remain
   underrepresented in personality research. Given their unique life
   history traits (e.g. slow growth rate, slow reproduction rate, long life
   span) and their pivotal role in ecosystem processes, this is an
   important gap in our current knowledge. Here we investigated consistency
   and plasticity in movement behaviour of wild juvenile lemon sharks,
   Negaprion brevirostris, by repeatedly subjecting sharks to open field
   tests. First, we investigated the presence of interindividual
   differences in movement behaviour in a novel open field. Second, we
   investigated the effect of trial repetition on movement behaviour to
   understand whether movement in a novel open field reflects a reaction to
   novelty, or general activity. Third, we estimated individual differences
   in habituation/sensitization rates over trial repetition and studied how
   the habituation rate was predicted by the initial movement rate. We
   found consistent individual differences in movement behaviour during the
   open field tests. Sharks showed habituation in movement behaviour (i.e.
   decrease) over repeated trials indicating that the movement behaviour
   during the first trials is a reaction to novelty, and not general
   activity. Individuals, however, differed in their rate of habituation
   (i.e. plasticity) and this rate was negatively related to an
   individual's movement behaviour in the first open field trial. In
   addition to showing individual differences in consistency and plasticity
   in juvenile lemon sharks, our study emphasizes the importance of
   examining the validity of personality tests when adapting them to new
   species. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are often mediated through
   acoustic signals. If acoustic signals are consistent and related to an
   individual's personality, these consistent individual differences in
   signalling may be an important driver in social interactions. However,
   few studies in non-human mammals have investigated the relationship
   between acoustic signalling and personality. Here we show that acoustic
   signalling rate is repeatable and strongly related to personality in a
   highly social mammal, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica).
   Furthermore, acoustic signalling varied between environments of
   differing quality, with males from a poor-quality environment having a
   reduced vocalization rate compared with females and males from an
   enriched environment. Such differences may be mediated by personality
   with pigs from a poor-quality environment having more reactive and more
   extreme personality scores compared with pigs from an enriched
   environment. Our results add to the evidence that acoustic signalling
   reflects personality in a non-human mammal. Signals reflecting
   personalities may have far reaching consequences in shaping the
   evolution of social behaviours as acoustic communication forms an
   integral part of animal societies.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals are different, but they can work together to perform
   adaptive collective behaviours. Despite emerging evidence that
   individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less
   clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation
   in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative
   phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both
   solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibited
   idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persisted across days,
   with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75\% of the
   time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. similar to
   50\% of the time). These individual differences were robust to group
   composition. Surprisingly, these differences did not persist when
   individuals were tested in isolation, but returned when testing was once
   again done in groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches
   exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these
   differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context.
   Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects
   group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is
   performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how
   an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is
   modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major
   implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are
   facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider
   social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences. (C)

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species often consistently differ in their
   behaviour across time and context. These stable differences are usually
   termed `animal personality'. Parasitism is known to significantly
   influence the evolution of animal personality at least in part because
   more explorative individuals may meet parasites more frequently than
   less explorative ones. Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent
   individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be
   measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship
   between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in
   a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more
   explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally
   significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and
   more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we
   experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any
   alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship
   between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not
   induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become
   more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at
   the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and
   exploration) were repeatable. Furthermore, firebugs with a stronger
   immune response behaved more boldly but also less actively. (c) 2015

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the proximate factors that underpin
   individual variation in suites of correlated behaviours. In this paper,
   we propose that dietary macronutrient composition, an underexplored
   environmental factor, might play a key role. Variation in macronutrient
   composition can lead to among-individual differentiation in single
   behaviours ('personality') as well as among-individual covariation
   between behaviours ('behavioural syndromes'). Here, we argue that the
   nutritional balance during any life stage might affect the development
   of syndrome structure and the expression of genes with pleiotropic
   effects that influence development of multiple behaviours, hence genetic
   syndrome structure. We further suggest that males and females should
   typically differ in diet-dependent genetic syndrome structure despite a
   shared genetic basis. We detail how such diet-dependent multivariate
   gene-environment interactions can have major repercussions for the
   evolution of behavioural syndromes.}},

Title = {{Parental food provisioning is related to nestling stress response in
   wild great tit nestlings: implications for the development of
   personality}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Variation in early nutrition is known to play an important
   role in shaping the behavioural development of individuals. Parental
   prey selection may have long-lasting behavioural influences. In birds
   foraging on arthropods, for instance, the specific prey types, e.g.
   spiders and caterpillars, matter as they have different levels of
   taurine which may have an effect on personality development. Here we
   investigated how naturally occurring variation in the amounts of spiders
   and caterpillars, provisioned to nestlings at day 4 and 8 after
   hatching, is related to the response to handling stress in a wild
   passerine, the great tit (Parus major). Broods were cross-fostered in a
   split-brood design allowing us to separate maternal and genetic effects
   from early rearing effects. Adult provisioning behaviour was monitored
   on day four and day eight after hatching using video recordings.
   Individual nestlings were subjected to a handling stress test at an age
   of 14 days, which is a validated proxy for exploratory behaviour as an
   adult.
   Results: Variation in handling stress was mainly determined by the
   rearing environment. We show that, contrary to our predictions, not the
   amount of spider biomass, but the amount of caterpillar biomass
   delivered per nestling significantly affected individual performance in
   the stress test. Chicks provisioned with lower amounts of caterpillars
   exhibited a stronger stress response, reflecting faster exploratory
   behaviour later on in life, than individuals who received larger amounts
   of caterpillars.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that natural variation in parental
   behaviour in wild birds modulates the developmental trajectories of
   their offspring's personality via food provisioning. Since parental
   provisioning behaviour might also reflect the local environmental
   conditions, provisioning behaviour may influence how nestlings respond
   to these local environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a 1 min net restraint test was evaluated as a method to
   predict stress-coping style in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, by
   investigating the relationship between behaviour during the test and
   levels of plasma cortisol sampled after 30 min confinement. In two
   separate groups of S. alpinus, general linearized model revealed
   significant correlations between cortisol levels and principal component
   scores extracted from principal component analysis, combining measures
   of activity in the tests. With the use of glmulti, the model selection
   ruled out any effects of size, sex and order of capture on interrenal
   reactivity. In general, S. alpinus that were more active in the net
   restraint test also had low levels of circulating cortisol, suggesting a
   proactive coping style. The results from two repeated runs were not
   correlated, but both runs, performed eight days apart, show a negative
   correlation between post-stress cortisol level and activity in the net.
   The lack of consistency could be explained by different treatments
   before each run and individual differences in behavioural plasticity.
   The net restraint test is thus predictive of stress-coping style in S.
   alpinus, and has the benefit of being less time-consuming than the
   commonly used confinement stress test.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variation in selection has long been proposed as a mechanism by
   which genetic variation could be maintained despite short-term strong
   directional selection and has been invoked to explain the maintenance of
   consistent individual differences in behaviour. We tested the hypothesis
   that ecological changes through time lead to fluctuating selection,
   which could promote the maintenance of variation in female behavioural
   traits in a wild population of North American red squirrels. As
   predicted, linear selection gradients on female aggression and activity
   significantly fluctuated across years depending on the level of
   competition among juveniles for vacant territories. This selection acted
   primarily through juvenile overwinter survival rather than maternal
   fecundity. Incorporating uncertainty in individual measures of behaviour
   reduced the magnitude of annual selection gradients and increased
   uncertainty in these estimates, but did not affect the overall pattern
   of temporal fluctuations in natural selection that coincided with the
   intensity of competition for vacant territories. These temporal
   fluctuations in selection might, therefore, promote the maintenance of
   heritable individual differences in behaviour in this wild red squirrel
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of an animal's personality is the result of interactions
   between genetics, environment and experience. It is known that
   individuals are able to modulate their behaviour according to the
   context or the social environment. Many studies have shown for example,
   that familiarity among conspecifics diminishes aggressiveness, although
   little is known about the underlying processes. Nevertheless,
   personality traits have long been determined while ignoring the social
   context, especially in lower vertebrates such as fish. In the present
   experiment, we hypothesize that group connections (network density) may
   be positively correlated to consistency of aggressiveness by avoiding
   over-aggressive acts in further encounters. To test this hypothesis, we
   used eels (Anguilla anguilla) as a model species and monitored both
   aggressiveness and sociability in 64 individuals over their first 7
   months of growth from the glass eel stage. As expected, social fish were
   less aggressive than their non-social counterparts at all times,
   highlighting the existence of a behavioural syndrome in eels.
   Additionally, rank-order consistency of aggressiveness was higher in
   groups of fish with high social connectivity, compared to those in
   less-connected fish groups. While aggressiveness must be consistent to
   be considered a personality trait, our results suggest that both
   aggressiveness and its consistency are influenced by initial social
   context.}},

Abstract = {{One of the contemporary challenges of the behavioral syndromes
   literature is to identify how individual variation in behavior is
   determined, and whether this variation impacts ecological success.
   Although variation in experience is an obvious potential driver of
   intraspecific behavioral variation, predicting the impact of experience
   on suites of correlated behavioral traits is less intuitive.
   Specifically, if experience impacts traits that shape individuals'
   success in multiple contexts (e. g., foraging and anti-predator
   behavior), then experience could generate cross-contextual performance
   trade-offs associated with behavioral spillover. In the present study,
   we explore how sublethal experience with predators impacts various
   aspects of male behavioral tendencies in the Madagascar hissing
   cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa. First, we found that males'
   activity level and boldness were correlated together in the form of a
   behavioral syndrome. Second, we found that repeated sublethal
   interactions with predators shifted male boldness but not activity
   level, thus suggesting that the syndrome's constituent traits can
   respond to experience at least semi-independently. Third, we discovered
   that although predator exposure only influenced boldness, we found that
   boldness was highly correlated with males' ability to obtain rewarding
   positions in the harems of rival males. Taken together, our data suggest
   (but do not yet confirm) that although sublethal exposure to predators
   influences only a narrow subset of male's behavioral tendencies, these
   effects could still have nonintuitive consequences for males' success in
   functionally dissimilar ecological contexts (i.e., social and sexual
   encounters).}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, behavioral ecologists have applied quantitative genetic
   methods to investigate the evolution of behaviors in wild animal
   populations. The promise of quantitative genetics in unmanaged
   populations opens the door for simultaneous analysis of inheritance,
   phenotypic plasticity, and patterns of selection on behavioral
   phenotypes all within the same study. In this article, we describe how
   quantitative genetic techniques provide studies of the evolution of
   behavior with information that is unique and valuable. We outline
   technical obstacles for applying quantitative genetic techniques that
   are of particular relevance to studies of behavior in primates,
   especially those living in noncaptive populations, e.g., the need for
   pedigree information, non-Gaussian phenotypes, and demonstrate how many
   of these barriers are now surmountable. We illustrate this by applying
   recent quantitative genetic methods to spatial proximity data, a simple
   and widely collected primate social behavior, from adult rhesus macaques
   on Cayo Santiago. Our analysis shows that proximity measures are
   consistent across repeated measurements on individuals (repeatable) and
   that kin have similar mean measurements (heritable). Quantitative
   genetics may hold lessons of considerable importance for studies of
   primate behavior, even those without a specific genetic focus.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{136-141}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There has been growing interest in the causes and consequences of
   different behavioral types within members of the same species. Male
   Siamese fighting fish consistently adopt 1 of 3 behavioral strategies
   (i.e., fighter, lover, or divider) when encountering a male and female
   conspecific simultaneously. These strategies may carry fitness
   consequences if female conspecifics attend to these differences and use
   them when selecting mates. To address this question, female Siamese
   fighting fish were repeatedly presented with video playback images of
   males expressing these strategies in a series of preference tests.
   Subjects were exposed to male stimuli both sequentially and
   simultaneously. The results suggest that females prefer males using the
   lover strategy and actively avoid fighter males. This avoidance is found
   regardless of whether the male stimuli are presented sequentially or
   simultaneously. Although presentation type did not affect expressed
   preference, it did influence strength of preference, with females
   attending more to the divider and lover behavioral types in the
   simultaneous presentations. This study highlights the importance of
   using multiple presentation formats when examining mate preference and
   demonstrates that male behavioral type may influence female choice. In
   addition, it is one of the first examinations of how male behavioral
   type may influence female mate choice and suggests that female choice
   may be a mechanism for generating and/or maintaining differences in
   behavioral type.}},

   Behavioral tests were repeated in Eppendorf test tubes where we also
   measured resting metabolic rate (RMR). Results show that the response
   latency to a threatening/startling stimulus, and the total time spent in
   the state of tonic immobility, correlated across the tests. The
   behavioral responses were repeatable and RMR covaried phenotypically
   with personality: we found a negative correlation between response
   latency time and time spent immobile, a positive correlation between
   response latency and RMR, and a negative correlation between RMR and
   total time spent immobile. These correlations were also similar across
   trials performed in the Eppendorf test tubes and the plastic containers.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{According to theory in life-history and animal personality, individuals
   with high fitness expectations should be risk-averse, while individuals
   with low fitness expectations should be more bold. In female house mice,
   a selfish genetic element, the t haplotype, is associated with increased
   longevity under natural conditions, representing an appropriate case
   study to investigate this recent theory empirically. Following theory,
   females heterozygous for the t haplotype (+/t) are hypothesised to
   express more reactive personality traits and be more shy, less
   explorative and less active compared to the shorter-lived homozygous
   wildtype females (+/+). As males of different haplotype do not differ in
   survival, no similar pattern is expected. We tested these predictions by
   quantifying boldness, exploration, activity, and energetic intake in
   both +/t and +/+ mice. +/t females, unlike +/+ ones, expressed some
   reactive-like personality traits: +/t females were less active, less
   prone to form an exploratory routine and tended to ingest less food.
   Taken together these results suggest that differences in animal
   personality may contribute to the survival advantage observed in +/t
   females but fail to provide full empirical support for recent theory.}},

   inhibited) clusters with the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4+
   (PDQ-4+) in a sample of 738 outpatients. Fitness relevant parameters
   like mating success, reproductive output, self preservation, and access
   to status were assessed with the Life Outcome Questionnaire. No fitness
   advantages were found for high-A subjects. In contrast, high-B subjects
   tripled low-B subjects with regard to mating success and had 39\% more
   offspring. Further. high-C subjects outperformed low-C subjects in
   attaining status and avoiding risks. These findings help explain the
   commonness of some extreme personality traits in humans, and suggest
   that they should be seen as evolutionary strategies rather than as
   diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concepts of animal personality and human temperament are nearly
   identical, both emphasizing overt behaviors rather than conscious
   processes, and assuming a primary role of biology in shaping individual
   differences. A point of divergence is emphasis on development among
   temperament scholars. Whereas most definitions of personality and
   temperament emphasize differential continuity -the maintenance of
   individual differences in behavioral tendencies over time-several
   behaviors demonstrate absolute discontinuity-age-related changes in mean
   levels. Attention to species-wide changes in behaviors may generate
   insight regarding the forces that govern individual differences.
   Differential continuity may also be heterotypic, with an inferred
   genotypic attribute being manifest in different behaviors at different
   ages. Structural continuity-persistence of correlational patterns among
   variables at different ages-represents a tool for identifying coherence
   in the common underpinnings of these diverse behaviors. This article
   describes research exemplifying these forms of continuity in humans, and
   suggests potential implications for animal personality investigations.

Abstract = {{Animals often exhibit particular `personalities', i.e. their behaviour
   is correlated across different situations. Recent studies suggest that
   this limitation of behavioural plasticity may be adaptive, since
   continuous adjustment of one's behaviour may be time-consuming and
   costly. In social insects, particularly aggressive workers might
   efficiently take over fighting in the contexts of both nest defence and
   `policing', i.e. the regulation of kin conflict in the society. Here, we
   examine whether workers who engage in aggressive policing in the ant
   Platythyrea punctata play a prominent role also in nest defence against
   intruders. The participation of individuals in policing and nest defence
   was highly skewed and a minority of workers exhibited most of the
   aggression. Workers who attacked reproductives after experimental colony
   fusion were less active during nest defence and vice versa. This
   suggests that workers show situation-dependent behavioural plasticity
   rather than consistently aggressive personalities.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing recognition of the role of individual variation in
   patterns emerging at higher levels of biological organization. Despite
   the importance of the temporal configuration of ecological processes and
   patterns, intraspecific individual variation in diel activity patterns
   is almost never accounted for in behavioral studies at the population
   level. We used individual-based monitoring data from 98 GPS-collared
   brown bears in Scandinavia to estimate diel activity patterns before the
   fall hunting season. We extracted 7 activity measures related to timing
   and regularity of activity from individual activity profiles. We then
   used multivariate analysis to test for the existence of distinct
   activity tactics and their environmental determinants, followed by
   generalized linear regression to estimate the extent of
   within-individual repeatability of activity tactics. We detected 4
   distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to
   a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging
   habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity
   tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road
   densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to
   rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to
   more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods. We did not
   find evidence of diel activity tactics influencing survival during the
   subsequent hunting season. We conclude that individual variation in
   activity deserves greater attention than it currently receives, as it
   may help account for individual heterogeneity in fitness and could
   facilitate within-population niche partitioning that can have
   population-or community-level consequences.}},

Abstract = {{An intriguing question in behavioral biology is whether consistent
   individual differences (called animal personalities) relate to variation
   in cognitive performance because commonly measured personality traits
   may be associated with risk-reward trade-offs. Social insects, whose
   learning abilities have been extensively characterized, show consistent
   behavioral variability, both at colony and at individual level. We
   investigated the possible link between personality traits and learning
   performance in the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops. Exploratory
   activity, sociability, and aggression were assessed twice in ant
   foragers. Behaviors differed among individuals, they were partly
   repeatable across time and exploratory activity correlated positively
   with aggression. Learning abilities were quantified by differential
   conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response, a task that
   requires cue perception and information storage. We found that
   exploratory activity of individual ants significantly predicted learning
   performance: ``active-explorers{''} were slower in learning the task
   than ``inactive-explorers{''}. The results suggest for the first time a
   link between a personality trait and cognitive performance in eusocial
   insects, and that the underlying individual variability could affect
   colony performance and success.}},

Abstract = {{1. Individuals do not have complete information about the environment
   and therefore they face a trade-off between gathering information
   (exploration) and gathering resources (exploitation). Studies have shown
   individual differences in components of this trade-off but how stable
   these strategies are in a population and the intrinsic drivers of these
   differences is not well understood.
   2. Top marine predators are expected to experience a particularly strong
   trade-off as many species have large foraging ranges and their prey
   often have a patchy distribution. This environment leads these species
   to exhibit pronounced exploration and exploitation phases but
   differences between individuals are poorly resolved. Personality
   differences are known to be important in foraging behaviour but also in
   the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Here we test whether
   personality predicts an individual exploration-exploitation strategy
   using wide ranging wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) as a model
   system.
   3. Using GPS tracking data from 276 wandering albatrosses, we extract
   foraging parameters indicative of exploration (searching) and
   exploitation (foraging) and show that foraging effort, time in patch and
   size of patch are strongly correlated, demonstrating these are
   indicative of an exploration-exploitation (EE) strategy. Furthermore, we
   show these are consistent within individuals and appear stable in the
   population, with no reproductive advantage.
   4. The searching and foraging behaviour of bolder birds placed them
   towards the exploration end of the trade-off, whereas shy birds showed
   greater exploitation. This result provides a mechanism through which
   individual foraging strategies may emerge. Age and sex affected
   components of the trade-off, but not the trade-off itself, suggesting
   these factors may drive behavioural compensation to maintain resource
   acquisition and this was supported by the evidence that there were no
   fitness consequence of any EE trait nor the trade-off itself.
   5. These results demonstrate a clear trade-off between information
   gathering and exploitation of prey patches, and reveals for the first
   time that boldness may drive these differences. This provides a
   mechanism through which widely reported links between personality and
   foraging may emerge.}},

Abstract = {{Despite accumulating evidence for individual variation in behavioural
   plasticity, there is currently little understanding of the causes and
   consequences of this variation. An outstanding question is whether
   individual reaction norm (RN) slopes are consistent across different
   environmental variables-that is, whether an individual that is highly
   responsive to one environmental variable will be equally responsive to a
   second variable. Another important and related question is whether RNs
   are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are
   simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of
   zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and
   food availability that were repeated in discrete `bursts' of sampling
   through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more
   responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained
   variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time
   for both temperature (R-slope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses
   (R-slope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment
   (R-intercept = 0.83). Despite the high potential lability of behaviour,
   we have demonstrated consistency of behavioural RN components and
   identified potential energetic constraints leading to high consistency
   of thermal RNs and low consistency of food deprivation RNs.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's behavioural phenotype is a combination of its unique
   behavioural propensities and its responsiveness to environmental
   variation, also known as behavioural plasticity. In social species, we
   must not only explore how individuals respond to variations in the
   physical environment but also how they react to changes in their social
   environment. A growing body of work has demonstrated that the
   behavioural heterogeneity of a group can alter its responsiveness,
   decision making, and fitness. Whether an individual is more or less
   extreme than a partner - what we term its `relative personality' - may
   also alter individual behavioural responses. We determined exploratory
   tendencies of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio) and then constructed
   pairs with varying differences in `relative personality' to determine
   the effect of differences between partners on behavioural plasticity. We
   find that relative personality, but not the magnitude of the difference
   between partners, is the most important determinant of behavioural
   plasticity across social treatments. Despite this overall effect, pairs
   of fish exhibited no predictable leader follower interactions,
   suggesting that details of the experimental paradigm may be important in
   shaping social dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wild animals often engage in intense physical activity while performing
   tasks vital for their survival and reproduction associated with
   foraging, avoiding predators, fighting, providing parental care, and
   migrating. In this theme issue we consider how viewing these tasks as
   ``exercise{''}-analogous to that performed by human athletes-may help
   provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual variation in
   these types of behaviors and the importance of physical activity in an
   ecological context. In this article and throughout this issue, we focus
   on four key questions relevant to the study of behavioral ecology that
   may be addressed by studying wild animal behavior from the perspective
   of exercise physiology: (1) How hard do individual animals work in
   response to ecological (or evolutionary) demands?; (2) Do lab-based
   studies of activity provide good models for understanding activity in
   free-living animals and individual variation in traits?; (3) Can animals
   work too hard during ``routine{''} activities?; and (4) Can paradigms of
   ``exercise{''} and ``training{''} be applied to free-living animals?
   Attempts to address these issues are currently being facilitated by
   rapid technological developments associated with physiological
   measurements and the remote tracking of wild animals, to provide
   mechanistic insights into the behavior of free-ranging animals at
   spatial and temporal scales that were previously impossible. We further
   suggest that viewing the behaviors of non-human animals in terms of the
   physical exercise performed will allow us to fully take advantage of
   these technological advances, draw from knowledge and conceptual
   frameworks already in use by human exercise physiologists, and identify
   key traits that constrain performance and generate variation in
   performance among individuals. It is our hope that, by highlighting
   mechanisms of behavior and performance, the articles in this issue will
   spur on further synergies between physiologists and ecologists, to take
   advantage of emerging cross-disciplinary perspectives and technologies.}},

Abstract = {{1. The food plant quality influences feeding preferences and various
   life history traits of herbivorous insects. However, the effects of
   different host plant qualities on the behavioural phenotype have rarely
   been studied in behavioural ecology, especially in a
   pest-crop-framework. 2. Behavioural phenotypes of insects may not only
   be affected by external environmental factors, such as the host plant
   quality but are also shaped by internal factors, such as the sex and the
   age of individuals. 3. To study host plant effects on behavioural
   phenotypes, we reared mustard leaf beetles (Phaedon
   cochleariaeFabricius) either on their natural host watercress or on the
   crop cabbage, on which this beetle can be a pest. The behavioural
   phenotype was characterised twice in the adult lifetime by measuring six
   behavioural traits tested in distinct contexts. 4. Depending on the
   context, different behavioural traits were specifically affected by the
   host plant, the sex and/or the age. Beetles fed on cabbage became more
   active with age. Furthermore, the boldness tested in an unprotected
   environment context was influenced by the host, with beetles fed on
   cabbage being bolder, whereas the boldness in a hiding or predator
   attack context was affected by the age and/or the interaction of host
   plant x sex. 5. In conclusion, beetles fed on the crop cabbage develop a
   different behavioural phenotype compared to beetles fed on watercress.
   Previous results showed that beetles reared on cabbage have a higher
   reproductive output. Thus, beetles fed on the crop potentially express a
   faster pace-of-life.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{One possibility for why individual differences in behavioral plasticity
   are frequently associated with differences in personality might be that
   variation in personality is functionally related to variation in
   cognition. Evidence supporting a link between personality and cognition,
   however, is still limited and contradictory. In this study, we then
   conducted a laboratory experiment with zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata) aimed at examining the role of cognition in shaping individual
   differences in contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in behavior
   between contexts). Specifically, we measured neophobia by quantifying
   the latency of the birds to eat near a novel object in two different
   environments across a social gradient and assessed their learning
   performance on two discriminant tasks and a reversal task. In agreement
   with our expectation, we found that less neophobic individuals were less
   plastic in their responses compared to more neophobic ones. Less
   neophobic individuals were also faster to reach the learning criterion
   but only in the less difficult discriminant task they performed first.
   On the contrary, although we found evidence for individual consistency
   in learning performances, differences among individuals in the number of
   trials needed to pass the task in both the more difficult discriminant
   and reversal tasks were not associated with individual differences in
   neophobia. Thus, our findings indicate that individual differences in
   contextual plasticity do not necessarily result from some individuals
   being more sensitive to environmental changes. Instead, we suggest that
   differences among individuals in their level of plasticity might result
   from differences in the number of suitable habitats they may occupy.}},

Abstract = {{Trait-based ecology argues that an understanding of the traits of
   interactors can enhance the predictability of ecological outcomes. We
   examine here whether the multidimensional behavioural-trait diversity of
   communities influences community performance and stability in situ. We
   created experimental communities of web-building spiders, each with an
   identical species composition. Communities contained one individual of
   each of five different species. Prior to establishing these communities
   in the field, we examined three behavioural traits for each individual
   spider. These behavioural measures allowed us to estimate community-wide
   behavioural diversity, as inferred by the multidimensional behavioural
   volume occupied by the entire community. Communities that occupied a
   larger region of behavioural-trait space (i.e. where spiders differed
   more from each other behaviourally) gained more mass and were less
   likely to disband. Thus, there is a community-wide benefit to
   multidimensional behavioural diversity in this system that might
   translate to other multispecies assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Dominance hierarchies characterize social groups of various species and
   can significantly influence individual fitness. Personality traits,
   consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been
   proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies
   so far have investigated the link between personality traits and
   dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the
   relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked
   to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object
   neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees,
   Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in
   flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that
   if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups,
   dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic
   than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped
   chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of
   linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were
   significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that
   they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that
   proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the
   establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We
   discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual
   attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance
   hierarchies found in nature. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Investigating how environmental factors influence within-species trait
   variability is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance
   of individual behavioural differences (i.e. temperament or personality),
   and their integration into wider ecological theory. Populations of
   Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly
   contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to
   investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits.
   Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel
   environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory
   conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for
   repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between
   populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel
   environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and
   inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable
   behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of
   boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex,
   while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This
   suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently
   according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that
   fish caught from environments without predators and with probable
   intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel
   food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat
   differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes,
   relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable
   insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we
   define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of
   studying temperament within a community ecology context. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Among-individual differences in behavior are now a widely studied
   research focus within the field of behavioral ecology. Furthermore,
   elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves,
   and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this,
   we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of
   behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a
   particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely
   activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make
   behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure
   to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the
   mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e.,
   variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer.
   We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral
   expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral
   variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove
   large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of
   repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a
   novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel
   environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham
   injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences.
   Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and
   repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that
   individuals face throughout their lives.
   Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in
   behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals
   are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it
   is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure
   to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated
   how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean
   behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results
   show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual
   differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose
   oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel
   environment). These results highlight the sensitivity of behavioral
   differences to elements of state, such as infection status.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual
   behavioral variation has become a major focus in behavioral ecology, yet
   we still know remarkably little about how abiotic and biotic factors
   influence personality-dependent fitness trade-offs in naturally
   occurring systems. In particular, fitness trade-offs associated with
   abiotic factors remain underrepresented in the animal personality
   literature. Here, we examine the interacting effects of personality and
   temperature on survival and reproduction-both at the individual and
   colony level-using the socially polymorphic spider Anelosimus studiosus
   as a model system. Overall, temperature had a profound effect on
   survival and reproduction, but the effect differed according to both
   individual personality and the personality composition of colonies.
   Temperature was positively correlated with mortality rates but
   negatively correlated with reproductive rates in aggressive individuals,
   whereas the opposite was true in docile individuals. Colonies composed
   of either all aggressive or all docile individuals suffered reduced
   reproductive rates in high and low temperatures, respectively. In
   contrast, colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile
   individuals performed equally well at both high and low temperatures,
   suggesting that some aspect of colony living helps buffer individuals
   with ill-suited personalities from environmental conditions that would
   otherwise lead to their demise. Our study demonstrates the need to
   consider both abiotic and biotic (i.e., social) context when assessing
   the impact of personality on fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in the manner that they cope with risk. When these
   behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging
   environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted
   within the ``coping style{''} framework. As studying inter-individual
   variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used
   a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral
   response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using
   behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a
   calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second,
   explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a
   coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the
   stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of
   phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters
   were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual
   stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was
   considerable covariation among the stress response parameters,
   describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level.
   Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive
   individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy
   metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences
   in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food
   acquisition tactics and demographic performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Architectural constructions allow animals to modify their environment in
   order to improve their reproductive success. Constructions also modulate
   the expression of individual behavior, ultimately affecting the presence
   and importance of animal personality within populations. The exact
   impact of constructions on personality is seldom investigated. We
   quantified experimentally the impact of web characteristics on
   individual foraging behavior in the Western black widow spider
   (Latrodectus hesperus). We assayed aggressiveness toward a prey cue, and
   boldness while individuals resided on their own web versus after being
   translocated onto webs built by conspecifics. We quantified the
   importance of individual differences in aggressiveness and boldness
   while accounting for differences in web characteristics. We tested for
   relationships between web building, aggressiveness, and boldness. Web
   characteristics affected spider aggressiveness and interacted with
   individual web-building behavior to explain up to a fifth of the
   variation in foraging aggression, but did not affect spider boldness.
   Even after accounting for web characteristics, individuals still
   exhibited important differences in aggressiveness. We detected no
   relationship between an individual's aggressiveness behavioral type and
   the characteristics of the web it built. Surprisingly, web
   characteristics impacted aggressiveness differently from one individual
   to the next. Hence the effect of web characteristics on foraging
   behavior might depend on condition or past experience. Webs contributed
   mostly to the variation in aggressiveness within-individuals. Variation
   in web building behavior might affect the amount of consistent
   differences in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior among
   individuals and needs to be accounted for when quantifying individual
   variation in behavior in spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been linked to individual fitness across many
   taxa. However, the exact path by which personality translates into
   fitness is rarely identified. We tested whether nest site choice may
   serve as a potential pathway linking personality and reproductive
   success in a natural population of chestnut thrush, Turdus rubrocanus.
   Using path analysis, we found that human disturbance and choice of nest
   site with respect to nest density may both mediate the link between
   personality and reproductive success. Bolder females may choose nest
   sites with lower nest density, and the low nest density in turn may be
   responsible for a positive effect on nestling number, and have a
   negative effect on nestling mass. Bolder females may also prefer nest
   sites further from human settlements, resulting in a negative effect on
   nestling mass. Our findings provide rare exact mechanistic pathways by
   which boldness might be translated into reproductive success. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The existence of personalities has been explored in various
   invertebrates, but a comprehensive investigation of personality
   differences across individuals in a eusocial insect has not yet been
   conducted. The study of personality differences across individuals
   within the same behavioral caste may contribute to an understanding of
   how social insects divide labor within the nest. Here, we define and
   investigate three dimensions of personality within the worker caste of a
   model social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, as follows: (1)
   consistent individual behavioral differences over time, (2) consistent
   individual behavioral differences across contexts, and (3) the presence
   of correlated suites of behaviors. To test whether honey bee workers
   exhibit dimensions 1 and 2, we repeatedly assessed responses of groups
   of same-age bees in cages to stimuli that are relevant to bee life
   history. To test for dimension 3, we examined behavior within a colony
   context by using observation hives to record the behaviors of individual
   bees across their lifetimes. Our results provide some evidence for all
   three dimensions of personality in honey bee workers. In particular, our
   data suggest some individuals may be more likely to be highly
   interactive with other workers (e.g., engaging in food sharing), while
   other individuals are consistently less interactive. These findings
   expand upon and contribute to previous models for the organization of
   worker division of labor in honey bees, suggesting that consistent
   behavioral differences (personalities) of workers within a behavioral
   caste have the potential to contribute to subcaste division of labor.
   Significance statement
   Behavioral ecologists have become increasingly interested in animal
   personalities, individual behavioral differences that are consistent
   over time and in different contexts, with recent focus on understanding
   the occurrence of personalities across taxa and their adaptive value.
   The existence and function of personality differences among individuals
   in complex societies, such as eusocial insects, remain understudied.
   Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of whether
   workers of the highly eusocial honey bee show hallmarks of personality.
   Although these workers demonstrate well-documented behavioral changes as
   they age, we uncovered some aspects of their behavior, in particular,
   their tendency to physically interact with other bees, remain somewhat
   consistent even as they age and change roles within the colony. We
   suggest that individual-level personality differences have the potential
   to contribute to colony division of labor by creating variation in
   individual tendencies to perform different tasks.}},

Title = {{Plasticity varies with boldness in a weakly-electric fish}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The expression of animal personality is indicated by
   patterns of consistency in individual behaviour. Often, the differences
   exhibited between individuals are consistent across situations. However,
   between some situations, this can be biased by variable levels of
   individual plasticity. The interaction between individual plasticity and
   animal personality can be illustrated by examining situation-sensitive
   personality traits such as boldness (i.e. risk-taking and exploration
   tendency). For the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, light
   condition is a major factor influencing behaviour. Adapted to navigate
   in low-light conditions, this species chooses to be more active in dark
   environments where risk from visual predators is lower. However, G.
   petersii also exhibit individual differences in their degree of
   behavioural change from light to dark. The present study, therefore,
   aims to examine if an increase of motivation to explore in the safety of
   the dark, not only affects mean levels of boldness, but also the
   variation between individuals, as a result of differences in individual
   plasticity.
   Results: Boldness was consistent between a novel-object and a
   novel-environment situation in bright light. However, no consistency in
   boldness was noted between a bright (risky) and a dark (safe) novel
   environment. Furthermore, there was a negative association between
   boldness and the degree of change across novel environments, with shier
   individuals exhibiting greater behavioural plasticity.
   Conclusions: This study highlights that individual plasticity can vary
   with personality. In addition, the effect of light suggests that
   variation in boldness is situation specific. Finally, there appears to
   be a trade-off between personality and individual plasticity with shy
   but plastic individuals minimizing costs when perceiving risk and bold
   but stable individuals consistently maximizing rewards, which can be
   maladaptive.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Consistent behavioral differences among individuals, or personalities,
   have been hypothesized to arise as a result of consistent individual
   differences in hormone levels. Individual variation in baseline hormone
   levels or hormonal similarity within a breeding pair may be related to
   reproductive success, as suggested by the corticosterone-fitness
   hypothesis and the hormonal similarity hypothesis, respectively. In a
   population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) with repeatable
   behavioral expression and coordination of behavior within pairs, we
   tested if baseline androgen and corticosterone levels are related to
   behavioral expression, if coordination in behavior within pairs is
   facilitated by hormonal coordination, and if baseline hormone levels are
   related to fledging success at the individual or pair level. We found no
   significant relationship between hormone levels and nest visit rate or
   nest defense for either sex. Androgen and corticosterone levels were not
   correlated within pairs, but pairs in which males exhibited more
   aggressive nest defense behavior than females were also more different
   in androgen levels. Females with higher baseline corticosterone levels
   fledged more young, but hormonal similarity within pairs was not related
   to fledging success. Our results provide support for the
   corticosterone-adaptation hypothesis, which suggests that elevation of
   baseline corticosterone levels may occur during breeding to meet
   increased energetic demands. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Variation in behavioural plasticity regulates consistent individual
   differences in Enallagma damselfly larvae}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Plastic behavioural responses by individuals to different conditions and
   consistent individual differences in mean behaviour across situations
   both contribute to variation in a population. The relationship between
   behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences is not
   clearly understood but may help predict personality variation in
   animals. High variation in mean behaviour and low variation in
   individual plastic responses will tend to maintain the rank order of
   individuals across situations and so permit consistent individual
   differences. Conversely, low variation in mean behaviour and high
   variation in plastic responses, by changing the rank orders of
   individuals, will erode consistent individual differences. Thus,
   selection that reduces variation in individual plastic responses should
   increase the opportunity for consistent individual differences in a
   population. We tested for relationships between heterogeneous predation
   regimes, the mean and variance of behavioural plasticity and consistent
   individual differences among three species groups of larval damselflies.
   Larvae of Enallagma signatum probably face consistent predation from
   fish over successive generations, whereas Enallagma ebrium/hageni and
   Enallagma annexum/boreale face a changing predation regime over
   generations either from fish or larval dragonflies. The behavioural
   reaction norms of larvae in repeated exposure trials to cues from a
   predatory fish, dragonfly larvae or no predator differed between species
   groups. Enallagma ebrium/hageni expressed the most consistent plastic
   response to predator cues, less variability in plasticity and greater
   consistent individual differences across cues compared to more variable
   plastic responses and low consistent individual differences in E.
   signatum. Selection on behavioural plasticity may enhance consistent
   individual differences in E. ebrium/hageni whereas relaxing selection on
   plasticity may reduce consistent individual differences in E. signatum.
   More generally, selection on plastic behaviour may enhance behavioural
   types while selection on mean behaviour may reduce behavioural types in
   animal populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{I experimentally tested the repeatability and plasticity of two

   juvenile three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. I quantified
   between-individual variation in these behaviours as well as behavioural
   changes over time in two groups of sticklebacks that were either exposed
   or not exposed to simulated predation pressure. Shoaling and risk taking
   were repeatable within individuals in both experimental and control
   fish. Individual willingness to shoal increased over time in both
   experimental and control groups, but there was no evidence that shoaling
   changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal
   changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became
   increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this
   behaviour is plastic. There was, however, no evidence of
   between-individual variation in the behavioural changes over time in
   either the control or experimental condition, suggesting that
   behavioural plasticity is a fixed response in the individuals of this
   population. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Behavioural differences between individuals are often found to be
   consistent across contexts and/or over time, although recent studies
   suggest that ontogenetic processes and learning might influence
   personality. During ontogeny, environmental influences may play an
   important role in shaping an individual's personality as well as its
   physiology. Seasonal changes are ubiquitous and known to influence
   development. To study developmental plasticity, of behaviour and
   physiology in the wild cavy (Cavia aperea), we manipulated the
   photoperiod in a fully crossed match-mismatch design by simulating
   spring and autumn photoperiod until weaning and subsequently moving half
   of the animals into the mismatching photoperiod. We found developmental
   plasticity in behavioural and physiological traits before and after
   sexual maturation for growth, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness.
   For fearlessness, changes in response to the opposite photoperiod were
   more pronounced in males than in females. Exploration and boldness were
   only influenced by early, but not by late photoperiod. No sex
   differences were found for these two traits. Even though our treatment
   changed average trait expression, some behavioural traits proved
   consistent over time, but physiological traits were not. Fearlessness
   was consistent only in animals that did not change photoperiod during
   development, whereas exploration and boldness were consistent over time
   regardless of photoperiodic treatment. Our study shows that in response
   to a change in photoperiod personality traits differ substantially in
   developmental plasticity.}},

Title = {{Contribution of within-litter interactions to individual differences in
   early postnatal growth in the domestic rabbit}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{145-153}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Interactions with littermates are an important component of the early
   environment of altricial mammals, frequently with major consequence for
   individual development, growth and survival. Early differences in
   starting mass within litters are often predictive of individual
   differences in behaviour and development, although to what extent such
   differences are independent of (epi) genetic factors is not always
   clear. In our study on domestic rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, we
   created experimentally mixed litters consisting of either heavier or
   lighter pups obtained from different litters at birth and raised by
   foster mothers. We hypothesized that pups' body mass relative to their
   new littermates would determine the nature of their social interactions
   with consequences for their early growth, largely independent of their
   absolute or relative body mass in their litters of origin. As predicted,
   pups with a higher starting mass on postnatal day 1 compared to members
   of their new litter consistently had more neighbours in the litter
   huddle, thus reflecting their more central position. In turn, pups with
   more neighbours had relatively higher body temperatures, greater milk
   intake and a higher milk conversion ratio, resulting in relatively
   greater growth during the first critical postnatal week. Relative body
   mass in the litter of origin or absolute body mass had no notable
   effect, indicating that the observed developmental patterns were truly
   driven by pups' body mass relative to their current littermates rather
   than being a consequence of (epi) genetic effects potentially associated
   with their birth mass. In conclusion, our study underlines the
   importance of interactions among siblings in shaping individual
   differences in early growth and development largely independent of
   genetic factors. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

   mother-offspring communication with strong implications for offspring
   survival. In addition, the neural control of vocalisation is closely
   associated with emotional state.
   Results: We found marked similarities in the pattern of individual
   responses of the young of both species to separation from their mother
   and littermates. In the domestic cat as well as in the mound-building
   mouse, individual differences in the frequency of calls and to a lesser
   extent in locomotor activity were repeatable across age, indicating the
   existence of personality types. Such consistencies across age were also
   apparent when only considering relative individual differences among
   litter siblings. In both species, however, individual patterns of
   vocalisation and locomotor activity were unrelated. This suggests that
   these two forms of behavioural responses to isolation represent
   different domains of personality, presumably based on different
   underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.
   Conclusions: Brief separation experiments in young mammals, and
   particularly the measurement of separation calls, provide a promising
   approach to study the ontogeny of personality traits. Future long-term
   studies are needed to investigate the association of these traits with
   biologically meaningful and potentially repeatable elements of behaviour
   during later life.}},

Abstract = {{Both juvenile and adult animals display stable behavioural differences
   (personality), but lifestyles and niches may change as animals mature,
   raising the question of whether personality changes across ontogeny.
   Here, we use a wild population of red squirrels to examine changes in
   activity and aggression from juvenile to yearling life stages.
   Personality may change at the individual level (individual stability),
   population level (mean level stability), and relative to other
   individuals (differential stability). We calculated all three types of
   stability, as well as the structural stability of the
   activity-aggression behavioural syndrome. Within individuals, both
   activity and aggression scores regressed towards the mean. Differential
   stability was maintained for activity, but not aggression. Structural
   stability was maintained; however, the activity-aggression correlation
   increased in squirrels that gained territories later in the season.
   These results suggest that personality undergoes some changes as animals
   mature, and that the ontogeny of personality can be linked to
   environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Selection due to social interactions comprises competition over matings
   (sexual selection stricto sensu) plus other forms of social competition
   and cooperation. Sexual selection explains sex differences in
   ornamentation and in various other phenotypes, but does not easily
   explain cases where those phenotypes are similar in males and females.
   Understanding such similarities requires knowing how phenotypes
   influence nonsexual social interactions as well, which can be very
   important in gregarious animals, but whose role for phenotypic evolution
   has been overlooked. For example, mate choice' experiments often found
   preferences for ornamentation, but have not assessed whether those are
   strictly sexual or are general social preferences. Using choice
   experiments with a gregarious and mutually ornamented finch, the common
   waxbill (Estrilda astrild), we show that preferences for ornamentation
   in the opposite-sex also extend to same-sex interactions. Waxbills
   discriminated between opposite- and same-sex individuals, but most
   preferences for colour traits were similar when interacting with either
   sex. Similar preferences in sexual and nonsexual associations may be
   widespread in nature, either as social adaptations or as by-product of
   mate preferences. In either case, such preferences may set the stage for
   the evolution of mutual ornamentation and of various other similarities
   between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{While the concept of consistent behavioural differences among

   Griffen (2014) introduce a promising avenue for future research
   synthesizing concepts and ideas from animal behaviour and food web
   ecology. More precisely, by showing that the interplay of animal
   personalities and predator and prey body sizes significantly alters the
   outcome of predator-prey interactions, this study provides important
   evidence that the concept of animal personalities needs greater
   consideration if we want to refine and improve current models of
   predator-prey interactions and the impact of individual-level variation

Abstract = {{Courtship signals are expected to be consistent within but vary between
   males of different qualities. Such traits are, therefore, predicted to
   exhibit high repeatability. However, studies have shown that courtship
   behaviors vary greatly in their within-individual repeatability,
   resulting in substantial variation in their ability to reflect male
   quality. This has implications for the evolution of female mate choice
   and courtship communication, as low levels of repeatability may reflect
   courtship signals that do not provide accurate quality information to
   females. In this article, we tested whether male courtship shuddering in
   the tropical orb-web spider, Argiope radon, influences female mate
   choice. We also tested whether male shudder performance reflects male
   phenotypic condition and is repeatable. We found that male shudder
   performance and condition predicted female latency to move onto the
   mating thread, a measure of mate preference. Aspects of male shudder
   performance were positively correlated with male body condition.
   Further, we found surprisingly high levels of repeatability in male
   courtship shuddering, ranking among the highest levels recorded to date
   for courtship behavior. We suggest that male courtship shuddering
   functions as an important indicator of male quality, with strong
   potential to respond to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Recently emerged brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) foraging in
   still-water pools along the sides of streams tend to be either
   sedentary, feeding from the lower portion of the water column (a
   sit-and-wait tactic), or very active, feeding from the upper portion of
   the water column (an active search tactic). We tested whether the
   individual differences in foraging behavior were associated with
   baseline concentrations and responses of cortisol, a steroid hormone
   linked to personality differences in a variety of animals including
   fishes. We quantified the proportion of time spent on moving by focal
   charr in the field and then capturing them. Captured individuals were
   either (i) sacrificed immediately to quantify baseline cortisol
   concentrations, (ii) held in an unfamiliar field environment for 15 min
   and then sacrificed to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to
   handling and holding in a novel field environment, or (iii) held in an
   unfamiliar field environment with a white Plexiglas base (stressor) for
   15 min to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to a novel
   object. Eleven statistical models relating cortisol concentrations to
   the proportion of time individuals spent on moving while searching for
   prey were compared using multi-model inferencing. Cortisol
   concentrations were higher for charr that spent a lower proportion of
   time on moving in the field than for charr that spent a higher
   proportion of time on moving. For a given proportion of time spent on
   moving, mean cortisol concentrations between baseline and experimental
   treatments, our measure of cortisol response, did not differ markedly.
   Our findings suggest that the foraging tactics displayed by wild brook
   charr in the field could reflect differences in how individuals perceive
   their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between behavioural traits constrain animals to a limited
   range of behavioural choices and set a limit to the available variation
   in behavioural phenotype of a population. These constraints are
   especially important during stressful situations, potentially limiting
   the ability to cope with stress appropriately. As yet, very little
   consideration has been given to a possible role for sexual selection in
   maintaining differences in behavioural stability within individuals:
   sex-specific differences in behavioural correlations have been seldom
   studied, especially in the wild. In this field study, we investigated
   associations between neophobia (latency to enter nest in the presence of
   a novel object), nest defence (response to a model predator) and
   breathing rate in response to handling in breeding pied flycatchers
   (Ficedula hypoleuca). We did not find any significant difference in
   antipredator responses between males and females, which indicates low
   sexual conflict over parental care in the pied flycatcher. However,
   females were more neophobic than males, while males and females did not
   differ in their breathing rates. Further, our study demonstrated a
   strong positive correlation between nest defence behaviour and neophobia
   in male, but not in female pied flycatchers. Males that defended their
   nest more had lower breathing rate and higher latency to resume nestling
   feeding after encountering a predator decoy than males that mobbed less
   intensely. We found only weak evidence that nest partners might affect
   each other's behaviour in these contexts.}},

Title = {{Context Consistency and Seasonal Variation in Boldness of Male
   Two-Spotted Gobies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{In order to attribute the behaviour of an animal to its personality it
   is important to study whether certain behavioural traits show up
   consistently across a variety of contexts. The aim of this study was to
   investigate whether breeding state males of the two-spotted goby,
   Gobiusculus flavescens, showed consistent degree of boldness when tested
   in four different behaviour assays. We also wanted to investigate
   whether boldness varied over the breeding season in accordance with
   changes in male-male competition for matings. We used two standard
   assays (the emergence test and the open field test), and two simple
   assays related to threat response. Repeated runs of each of the tests
   were highly correlated, and we found significant correlations between
   all four assays. Thus, we have documented both a within and a
   between-context consistency in risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we
   found that goby males studied during the middle of the breeding season
   were bolder than males studied at the end of the season. Since male
   two-spotted gobies face strongly decreasing male-male competition as the
   season progresses, the benefit of being bold for the mating success of
   the males may differ over the time of the breeding season. The
   difference in behaviour found over the season thus corresponds well with
   the sexual dynamics of this model species.}},

   Coral Reef Fish}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{The theory of behavioral syndromes focuses on quantifying variation in
   behavior within and among individual organisms and attempts to account
   for the maintenance of differences in behavior that occur in a
   consistent manner among individuals. Behavioral syndromes have
   potentially important ecological consequences (e.g. survivorship
   tradeoffs) and can be shaped by population dynamics through selective
   mortality. Here, we search for any evidence for consistency of behavior
   across situations in juveniles of a common damselfish, Pomacentrus
   amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at the transition between larval habitats in
   the plankton and juvenile habitats on the reef. Naive fish leaving the
   pelagic phase to settle on reefs were caught by light traps and their
   behaviors observed using similar methods across three different
   situations (small aquaria, large aquaria, field setting); all of which
   represent low risk and well-sheltered environments. Seven behavioral
   traits were compared within and among individuals across situations to
   determine if consistent behavioral syndromes existed. No consistency was
   found in any single or combination of behavioral traits for individuals
   across all situations. We suggest that high behavioral flexibility is
   likely beneficial for newly-settled fish at this ontogenetic transition
   and it is possible that consistent behavioral syndromes are unlikely to
   emerge in juveniles until environmental experience is gained or certain
   combinations of behaviors are favored by selective mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Kralj-Fiser etal. recently reviewed the lack of evidence in favor of the

   criteria that need to be met to accept the spillover hypothesis, and
   conclude that the hypothesis is not generally supported. Here, I comment
   on several aspects of their position. In doing so, I identify areas in
   which we differ and point out several strengths of past tests of the
   spillover hypothesis. In particular, I suggest that researchers testing
   the spillover hypothesis have done an excellent job of studying sexual
   cannibalism in the broader context of a movement within behavioral
   ecology to understand where an animal's behavior falls along a continuum

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In many species, consistent behavioural differences among individuals
   are linked to fitness variation. Determining the environmental and
   genetic factors that mould these behavioural types is crucial to
   understanding how behaviours might respond to selection. Male bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, show extensive consistent behavioural
   variation in their levels of courtship, male-directed aggression and
   female-directed aggression, resulting in a range of fitness-related
   behavioural types coexisting within a population. To determine whether
   the behavioural components underlying a male's stable behavioural type
   in the mating context are heritable and genetically correlated, we
   performed paternal half-sib crosses. Using animal models, we found that
   all three of these mating behaviours were moderately heritable (h(2) =
   0.17-0.29) and courtship behaviour was also heritable as a binomial
   trait (court yes/no: h(2) = 0.50). Including effects of dam
   identity/common rearing environment experienced by full sibs decreased
   model fit, suggesting that early social interactions might contribute to
   behavioural types. In addition, we found evidence consistent with the
   possibility that the positive phenotypic correlations among mating
   behaviours are underlain by positive genetic correlations. Thus, it is
   possible that the seemingly maladaptive aggression that males direct
   towards females during social interactions persist due to genetic
   constraints and direct selection on male-directed aggression and
   courtship behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{The Effect of Exploration on the Use of Producer-Scrounger Tactics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Individuals foraging in groups can use two different tactics for
   obtaining food resources. Individuals can either search for food sources
   themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others
   (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially
   explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise
   between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and
   scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this
   compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic
   algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and
   scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch
   richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under
   conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored
   whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that
   either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch
   richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals
   were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities.
   Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a
   divergence of exploration `types' within a given environment, but there
   was a general association between exploration and scrounging across
   different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over
   nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of
   producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that
   cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our
   results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can
   affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the
   optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both.}},

   Sable Island, Canada. Across the study, young males (10-15 years) gained
   body mass, while old males (23-31 years) lost body mass. Body length was
   an important determinant of tenure (time spent at a site among females)
   and males of all ages exhibited a high level of consistency in duration
   of tenure (r = 0.40-0.50). In young males, our proxy of success showed a
   strong relationship with arrival body mass and also exhibited a high
   level of consistency (r = 0.50). None of the physical traits measured
   explained variation in success by exhibiting mating tactics that did not
   involve tenure, which is likely due to the opportunistic nature of those
   tactics. Whereas young male grey seals exhibited age-dependent
   improvements in success owing to changes in their physical state, later
   in life physical traits were less influential and suggest that
   nonphysical traits may compensate for a deteriorating physical state and
   its impact on male success.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies report the presence of consistent
   individual differences in behavior and/or physiology over time and
   context, known as animal personality. A pivotal question in animal
   personality research concerns the mechanism(s) responsible for its
   evolution and maintenance. Negative frequency-dependent selection is
   considered to be one of these important mechanisms, although evidence
   for this is largely absent. Here, we studied whether the feeding
   performance of barnacle geese was negative frequency-dependent in a
   producer-scrounger game. We studied the feeding time of one bold or one
   shy individual in groups consisting of only bold or shy companions to
   study if the rare type in the group performs best. A previous study with
   this species showed that scrounging increased with shyness. Hence, we
   expected shy individuals to do better in the presence of bold companions
   due to the increased scrounging opportunity and bold individuals to do
   better in the presence of shy companions as there were ample
   opportunities to produce food. We found no evidence for negative
   frequency-dependent feeding success; rather, we found that, independent
   of their boldness score, all individuals enjoyed higher feeding success
   when foraging with bold than with shy companions. The higher foraging
   success of individuals foraging with bold companions is explained by a
   higher joining proportion in the presence of bold companions. Our
   results provide no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding
   success in barnacle geese but indicate that both bold and shy
   individuals can increase their foraging returns by associating with bold
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits may play a role in
   reproductive behaviour and it is likely that different personality types
   have different reproductive success across specific social environments.
   This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types,
   including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive
   tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders
   (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing
   the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of
   personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto
   been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences
   in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a
   small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We
   predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males
   that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of
   behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural
   syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual
   male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm
   competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials.
   Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with
   the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression
   and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard
   a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant
   association between the tendency to guard and morphological and
   physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding
   tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating
   tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the
   product of prevailing environmental and social conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted three studies on the use of nonhuman animals as metaphors
   (zoomorphs) for human personality characteristics. In Study 1 (n = 51)
   university students rated gender, age, and favorableness of 36 mammal
   names when applied metaphorically to a person. In Study 2, we searched
   14 dictionaries of colloquial English and three dictionaries of animal
   phrases to locate zoomorphic use of these 36 animal species in
   describing human personality. In Study 3 (n = 28), students rated
   zoomorphic use of non-mammalian species. Most animal metaphors for human
   personality are uncomplimentary, reinforcing the perceived distance
   between humans and nonhuman animal species. Zoomorphs tend to be male
   and refer to healthy adult individuals, with little usage referring to
   disability or infirmity. There is greater zoomorphy for mammal names
   than for bird, insect or fish names.}},

Abstract = {{The target paper sets out an ambitious approach to animal personality
   research. This approach uses bottom-up measures and behavioural
   repertoires. This method holds promise for understanding personality
   trait expression in a given species; however, it has limited
   applications for comparing personality between species because it does
   not specify a measurement of interspecific similarity or difference and
   does not consider phylogenetic relationships between organisms. Our
   research led its to develop a modified top-down trait approach which
   makes comparing species feasible, is sensitive to species-level
   differences and is consistent with evolutionary thinking. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{While collective movement is ecologically widespread and conveys
   numerous benefits on individuals, it also poses a coordination problem:
   who controls the group's movements? The role that animal `personalities'
   play in this question has recently become a focus of research interest.
   Although many animal groups have distributed leadership (i.e. multiple
   individuals influence collective decisions), studies linking personality
   and leadership have focused predominantly on the group's single most
   influential individual. In this study, we investigate the relationship
   between personality and the influence of multiple leaders on collective
   movement using homing pigeons, Columba livia, a species known to display
   complex multilevel leadership hierarchies during flock flights. Our
   results show that more exploratory (i.e. `bold') birds are more likely
   to occupy higher ranks in the leadership hierarchy and thus have more
   influence on the direction of collective movement than less exploratory
   (i.e. `shy') birds during both free flights around their lofts and
   homing flights from a distant site. Our data also show that bold pigeons
   fly faster than shy birds during solo flights. We discuss our results in
   light of theories about the evolution of personality, with specific
   reference to the adaptive value of heterogeneity in animal groups.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Natural selection has been shown to drive population differentiation and
   speciation. The role of sexual selection in this process is
   controversial; however, most of the work has centered on mate choice
   while the role of male-male competition in speciation is relatively
   understudied. Here, we outline how male-male competition can be a source
   of diversifying selection on male competitive phenotypes, and how this
   can contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We highlight
   how negative frequency-dependent selection (advantage of rare phenotype
   arising from stronger male-male competition between similar male
   phenotypes compared with dissimilar male phenotypes) and disruptive
   selection (advantage of extreme phenotypes) drives the evolution of
   diversity in competitive traits such as weapon size, nuptial coloration,
   or aggressiveness. We underscore that male-male competition interacts
   with other life-history functions and that variable male competitive
   phenotypes may represent alternative adaptive options. In addition to
   competition for mates, aggressive interference competition for
   ecological resources can exert selection on competitor signals. We call
   for a better integration of male-male competition with ecological
   interference competition since both can influence the process of
   speciation via comparable but distinct mechanisms. Altogether, we
   present a more comprehensive framework for studying the role of
   male-male competition in speciation, and emphasize the need for better
   integration of insights gained from other fields studying the
   evolutionary, behavioral, and physiological consequences of agonistic
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{How animals react to novel food and objects is commonly thought of as a
   crucial step toward innovations. One would therefore expect innovative
   species to be attracted to novelty and benefit from a combination of low
   neophobia and a high motivation to explore. Here we draw attention to
   the innovation paradox: the most innovative species tend to show
   neophobic reactions when confronted with novel objects or food, but can
   use social cues to overcome their initial neophobia. Work on novelty
   response has highlighted the role of ecological factors as determinants
   of neophobia and exploration tendency. We examine social influences on
   novelty response and present the idea that social factors enable some
   species to maintain the paradoxical combination of high neophobia and
   high exploration tendency. We compare primates with other species, to
   assess the extent to which primates are unusual. We review empirical
   studies that show how intrinsic neophobia is generally overcome by
   social facilitation and social information, i.e., the presence of
   experts, especially in species with slow life history, probably because
   social information reduces risk. We also briefly discuss the role of
   environmental risk in reducing intrinsic neophobia, in particular its
   absence in captivity. We draw attention to a strong neophobia-reducing
   effect of being in captivity, due to humans acting as sources of social
   information. We propose that species showing the paradoxical combination
   of strong neophobia and strong exploration tendency use social
   information to select aspects of the environment worth exploring. The
   social information hypothesis thus offers an explanation for the paradox
   of neophobic explorers.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals at the leading edge of expanding biological invasions often
   show distinctive phenotypic traits, in ways that enhance their ability
   to disperse rapidly and to function effectively in novel environments.
   Cane toads (Rhinella marina) at the invasion front in Australia exhibit
   shifts in morphology, physiology and behaviour (directionality of
   dispersal, boldness, risk-taking). We took a common-garden approach,
   raising toads from range-core and range-edge populations in captivity,
   to see if the behavioural divergences observed in wild-caught toads are
   also evident in commongarden offspring. Captive-raised toads from the
   invasion vanguard population were more exploratory and bolder (more
   prone to `risky' behaviours) than toads from the range core, which
   suggests that these are evolved, genetic traits. Our study highlights
   the importance of behaviour as being potentially adaptive in invasive
   populations and adds these behavioural traits to the increasing list of
   phenotypic traits that have evolved rapidly during the toads' 80-year
   spread through tropical Australia.}},

Title = {{A Hypothesis and Review of the Relationship between Selection for
   Improved Production Efficiency, Coping Behavior, and Domestication}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Coping styles in response to stressors have been described both in
   humans and in other animal species. Because coping styles are directly
   related to individual fitness they are part of the life history
   strategy. Behavioral styles trade off with other life-history traits
   through the acquisition and allocation of resources. Domestication and
   subsequent artificial selection for production traits specifically
   focused on selection of individuals with energy sparing mechanisms for
   non-production traits. Domestication resulted in animals with low levels
   of aggression and activity, and a low hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis reactivity. In the present work, we propose that, vice versa,
   selection for improved production efficiency may to some extent continue
   to favor docile domesticated phenotypes. It is hypothesized that both
   domestication and selection for improved production efficiency may
   result in the selection of reactive style animals. Both domesticated and
   reactive style animals are characterized by low levels of aggression and
   activity, and increased serotonin neurotransmitter levels. However,
   whereas domestication quite consistently results in a decrease in the
   functional state of the HPA axis, the reactive coping style is often
   found to be dominated by a high HPA response. This may suggest that
   fearfulness and coping behavior are two independent underlying
   dimensions to the coping response. Although it is generally proposed
   that animal welfare improves with selection for calmer animals that are
   less fearful and reactive to novelty, animals bred to be less sensitive
   with fewer desires may be undesirable from an ethical point of view.}},

Title = {{Lifelong effects of trapping experience lead to age-biased sampling:
   lessons from a wild bird population}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{133-139}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of individually marked animals is usually required
   for reliable estimation of numerous life history parameters. However,
   capture, marking and manipulation can dramatically alter the animals'
   behaviour after capture, and thus affect subsequent recapture success.
   Here, we used a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population as an
   example to illustrate the sampling bias resulting from the repeated
   capture of free-ranging individuals. By using repeated measures of the
   same individuals obtained during our long-term survey, we specifically
   evaluated the interannual response of breeding adults to capture-related
   stress, measured as latency to enter nestboxes equipped with a
   swing-trap. Moreover, we examined changes in the mean and variance of
   bird age with varying trapping effort using subsamples of the data set.
   Birds without any previous trapping experience entered nests more
   quickly than experienced ones, after controlling for other factors
   affecting latency, such as the sex, offspring quality and the order of
   capture relative to the other pair member. Birds' reluctance to enter
   the nest furthermore increased as the number of captures in previous
   years accumulated, implying that individual pied flycatchers became
   progressively more difficult to capture over the course of the study.
   Our results indicate that repeated exposure to capture stress over an
   animal's lifetime may induce long-lasting behavioural modifications that
   may influence trappability of the older segments of the population. We
   also provide evidence that this may ultimately lead to sampling bias
   towards younger ages, especially when effort is limited. We conclude
   that systematic age bias due to trapping experience can have important
   implications for the estimation of variation in a range of traits and
   should therefore be carefully checked in longitudinal studies. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{There is an increased focus in biology on consistent behavioural
   variation. Several terms are used to describe this variation, including
   animal personality and coping style. Both terms describe between
   individual consistency in behavioural variation; however, they differ in
   the behavioural assays typically used, the expected distribution of
   response variables, and whether they incorporate variation in
   behavioural flexibility. Despite these differences, the terms are often
   used interchangeably. We conducted experiments using juvenile and adult
   red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, as subjects to explore the degree to
   which animal personality and coping styles overlap. We demonstrate that
   animal personality and coping styles can be described in this species,
   and that shyer individuals had more flexible responses, as expected for
   coping styles. Behavioural responses from both personality and coping
   style assays had continuous distributions, and were not clearly
   separated into two types. Behavioural traits were not correlated and,
   hence, there was no evidence of a behavioural syndrome. Further,
   behavioural responses obtained in personality assays did not correlate
   with those from coping style tests. Animal personality and coping styles
   are therefore not synonymous in the red junglefowl. We suggest that the
   terms animal personality and coping style are not equivalent and should
   not be used interchangeably. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

   behaviour in the southern corroboree frog}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{161-170}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in
   repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly
   understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of
   adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable
   differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in
   repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body
   size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on
   personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual
   variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive
   colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1)
   test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal
   personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and
   boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes
   (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3)
   determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at
   the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation
   along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations
   did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural
   syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance
   in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility
   and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations
   indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P.
   corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable
   between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test
   this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent
   individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to
   provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal
   personality. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   selection within groups maintains them}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{15-24}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A group's composition is important for its success. Colonies of the
   spider Anelosimus studiosus appear to have responded to this pressure by
   evolving the ability to maintain mixtures of docile versus aggressive
   individuals that help colonies avoid extinction. Here we demonstrate
   that colony extinction events unite the optimal group composition of all
   colony constituents, regardless of phenotype, with that of the colony as
   a whole. This is because colony extinction events explain the majority
   of individual mortality events in A. studiosus. Through within-and
   across-habitat colony manipulations, we further determined that
   reduction in reproductive output by individuals bearing overabundant
   phenotypes underlies the ability of colonies to adaptively regulate
   their compositions. When we experimentally created colonies with an
   overabundance of the docile or aggressive phenotype, individuals bearing
   the overabundant phenotype exhibited reduced reproductive output, which
   helped to move colony compositions back towards their site-specific
   optima. Colonies displaced from their native sites continued to recreate
   the patterns of reproductive output that characterized their site of
   origin, suggesting a genetic component to this trait. Individuals thus
   appear to adaptively cull their reproductive output depending on their
   phenotype and the composition of their colony. There is also
   considerable parent-offspring colony resemblance in the extent to which
   colonies can or do track their ideal compositions. This conveys a kind
   of collective heritability to this trait. Together, while group
   selection appears to be the principal driver of ongoing selection on
   group composition in A. studiosus, patterns of selection among
   individuals within groups appear to promote colonies' ability to track
   their ideal mixtures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are an important factor that affects the dispersal
   of animals. In the context of aquatic species, dispersal modeling needs
   to consider that most freshwater ecosystems are highly fragmented by
   barriers reducing longitudinal connectivity. Previous research has
   incorporated such barriers into dispersal models under the neutral
   assumption that all migrating animals attempt to ascend at all times.
   Modeling dispersal of animals that do not perform trophic or
   reproductive migrations will be more realistic if it includes
   assumptions of which individuals attempt to overcome a barrier. We aimed
   to introduce personality into predictive modeling of whether a
   nonmigratory invasive freshwater fish (the round goby, Neogobius
   melanostomus) will disperse across an in-stream barrier. To that end, we
   experimentally assayed the personalities of 259 individuals from
   invasion fronts and established round goby populations. Based on the
   population differences in boldness, asociability, and activity, we
   defined a priori thresholds with bolder, more asocial, and more active
   individuals having a higher likelihood of ascent. We then combined the
   personality thresholds with swimming speed data from the literature and
   in situ measurements of flow velocities in the barrier. The resulting
   binary logistic regression model revealed probabilities of crossing a
   barrier which depended not only on water flow and fish swimming speed
   but also on animal personalities. We conclude that risk assessment
   through predictive dispersal modeling across fragmented landscapes can
   be advanced by including personality traits as parameters. The inclusion
   of behavior into modeling the spread of invasive species can help to
   improve the accuracy of risk assessments.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the evolution of personality structure requires examining
   personality dimensions in multiple species using a common set of traits.
   Little research has been conducted on personality in wild populations of
   nonhuman primates. Using behavioral observations and questionnaire
   ratings, we examined factors influencing personality in 16 wild bonobos
   (Pan paniscus) at Wamba, Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of
   the Congo. We extracted five factors from 31 of the items from the
   Hominoid Personality Questionnaire (HPQ) and three factors from observed
   behaviors. The HPQ factors were labeled Unemotionality(Q),
   Friendliness(Q), Aggressiveness(Q), Irritability(Q), and Activity(Q).
   The behavioral factors were labeled Grooming(B), Playfulness(B), and
   Introversion(B). We established the convergent and divergent validity of
   these factors by obtaining correlations between the HPQ and behavioral
   factors. We tested for sex differences and found that males were
   significantly higher on Introversion(B) and significantly lower in
   Irritability(Q). We then tested for age differences and found that
   Friendliness(Q) was lower and Aggressiveness(Q) was higher in older
   individuals. Finally, we found that, among males, hierarchical rank was
   associated with higher Aggressiveness(Q). These findings contrast with
   findings in chimpanzees in ways consistent with known species
   differences. For one, consistent with the more egalitarian structure of
   bonobo society, we did not identify a clear Dominance factor. Also, the
   results related to sex differences were consistent with previous
   findings that reveal closer bonds between female bonobos than female
   chimpanzees. These findings highlight the importance of studying
   personality in closely related species and the need to consider species'
   socioecology when studying personality. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness, the tendency to be explorative, risk prone and proactive,
   often varies consistently between individuals. An individual's position
   on the boldness-shyness continuum has many implications. Bold
   individuals may outperform shyer conspecifics during foraging as they
   cover more ground, accumulate information more rapidly and make more
   frequent food discoveries. Individual variation in boldness may also
   affect behavioural plasticity across environmental contexts, as the time
   to process new information, the ability to locate and memorise resources
   and the time and ability to apply prior information in a novel context
   all differ between individuals. The primary aim of the current study was
   to examine plasticity in, and covariation between, boldness, foraging
   speed and foraging accuracy across social foraging contexts. We showed
   that the stickleback that were shyest when foraging alone became
   relatively boldest when foraging in a social context and also delayed
   their entry to a known food patch the most in the presence of
   conspecifics. These results support the assertion that shyer foragers
   are more reactive to social cues and add to current knowledge of how an
   individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum may correlate to
   foraging task performance and behavioural plasticity. We conclude that
   the correlation between boldness and behavioural plasticity may have
   broad relevance as the ability to adjust or retain behaviours in
   changing social environments could often have consequences for fitness.
   Animal personality may affect how much individuals change their
   behaviour to suit different environments. We studied the link between
   threespine stickleback personality (boldness or shyness), foraging
   performance and change in foraging performance when either alone or in
   the presence of other stickleback. We found that shyer threespine
   stickleback were more reactive to the presence of other fish when
   foraging. When observed or joined by other fish, shy stickleback started
   exploring earlier, but entered a known food patch later, than when
   alone. Bolder stickleback changed their foraging behaviour much less in
   the presence of other fish. Our results suggest that how bold or shy
   individuals are may have important consequences on how well they adjust
   their foraging behaviour to environmental change.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{217-222}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The prevalence of consistent among-individual differences in behaviour,
   or personality, makes adaptive sense if individuals differ in stable
   state variables that shift the balance between the costs and benefits of
   their behavioural decisions. These differences may give rise to both
   individual differences in, and covariance among, behaviours that
   influence an individual's exposure to risks. We here study the link
   between behaviour and a candidate state variable previously overlooked
   in the study of state-dependent personality variation: telomere length.
   Telomeres are the protective endcaps of chromosomes and their erosion
   with age is thought to play a crucial role in regulating organismal
   senescence and intrinsic lifespan. Following evidence that shorter
   telomeres may reduce the lifespan of animals in a wide range of taxa, we
   predict individuals with shorter telomeres to behave more boldly and
   aggressively. In order to test this, we measured telomere length and
   behaviour in wild juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). We found
   individuals with shorter fin telomeres to behave consistently more
   boldly and aggressively under controlled conditions in the laboratory.
   No such relationship was found with muscle telomere length 3-4 months
   after the behavioural assays. We suggest that telomere dynamics are an
   important factor integrating personality traits with other state
   variables thought to be important in the regulation of behaviour, such
   as metabolism, disease resistance and growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Recent empirical and conceptual papers have highlighted the potential
   for metabolism to act as a proximate mechanism for behavior that could
   explain animal personality (consistency over time). Under this
   hypothesis, individuals with consistently high levels of behavioral
   activity should also have high resting metabolic rate (RMR) as it can
   reflect capacity to process food and generate energy. We tested for the
   predicted positive covariance between RMR and three behaviors that
   differ in energy demands in 30 male guppies, using multivariate mixed
   models; we repeatedly measured their activity (10 times each), courtship
   displays (nine times), voracity (10 times), and metabolism (four-times).
   Resting metabolic rate (measured overnight in respirometry trials) did
   not consistently differ among males, whereas initial peak metabolism
   measured during those same trials (R=0.42), and all behaviors were
   repeatable (R=0.33-0.51). RMR declined over time suggesting habituation
   to the protocol, whereas peak metabolism did not. Initial peak
   metabolism was negatively correlated with courtship display intensity,
   and voracity was positively correlated with activity, but all other
   among-individual correlations were not significant. We conclude that RMR
   does not provide a proximate explanation for consistent individual
   differences in behavior in male guppies, and therefore the potential for
   independent evolution of these physiological and behavioral traits seems
   possible. Finally, we identify peak metabolism as a potential measure of
   the stress response to confinement, which highlights the value of
   considering various aspects of metabolic rates recording during
   respirometry trials.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that interindividual differences in the activity of brown
   trout alter the exposure to parasitic freshwater pearl mussel glochidia
   was tested in a Swedish stream. Wild yearling brown trout (N=103) were
   caught, individually tagged for identification and scored for open-field
   activity during standardized laboratory tests in June. Fifty gravid
   freshwater pearl mussels were relocated to the stream, where after the
   trout were released back into the stream. The fish were recaptured in
   October (N=35), checked for glochidia encystment (infested individuals:
   n=6) and re-scored for open-field activity traits. Swimming velocity
   during the test was higher in fish infected with glochidia, suggesting
   that high activity could increase their exposure to glochidia.
   Potentially, as metabolism rate and ventilation rate typically increase
   with activity, elevated activity may lead to an increased likelihood of
   glochidia passing over the gills. This novel finding suggests that
   glochidia infestation is non-random and that the behaviour of the host
   fish can influence the likelihood of glochidia infestation.}},

Title = {{Does personality affect premating isolation between locally-adapted
   populations?}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: One aspect of premating isolation between diverging,
   locally-adapted population pairs is female mate choice for resident over
   alien male phenotypes. Mating preferences often show considerable
   individual variation, and whether or not certain individuals are more
   likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied.
   In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted
   to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs, and females from adjacent
   non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We
   asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies
   (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate
   choice component of premating isolation in this system.
   Results: We characterized focal females for their personality and found
   behavioral measures of `novel object exploration', `boldness' and
   `activity in an unknown area' to be highly repeatable. Furthermore, the
   interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness
   affected focal females' strength of preference (SOP) for the resident
   male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High
   exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over
   alien mating partners in bold, but not shy, females. Shy and/ or little
   explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the
   non-resident phenotype and thus, are more likely to contribute to rare
   population hybridization. When we offered large vs. small conspecific
   stimulus males instead, less explorative females showed stronger
   preferences for large male body size. However, this effect disappeared
   when the size difference between the stimulus males was small.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that personality affects female mate
   choice in a very nuanced fashion. Hence, population differences in the
   distribution of personality types could be facilitating or impeding
   reproductive isolation between diverging populations depending on the
   study system and the male trait(s) upon which females base their mating
   decisions, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying evolutionary and developmental mechanisms underlying
   consistent between-individual differences in behaviour is the main goal
   in `animal personality studies'. Here, we explored whether activity and
   risk-taking varied consistently between individuals and correlated to
   various potentially fitness linked - male traits in Carpetan rock
   lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni). Lizards showed significant consistency
   within both behaviours, implying the presence of activity and
   risk-taking personalities. However, there were no correlation between
   activity and risk-taking, neither on the between-nor on the
   within-individual levels, implying the absence of a behavioural
   syndrome. We found a strong link between the intensity of blood parasite
   (Haemogregarinidae) infection and risk-taking: lizards with higher
   infection intensity took more risk. While we cannot distinguish cause
   from causative in the parasite intensity - risk-taking correlation our
   results are in line with the asset protection hypothesis predicting that
   individuals with lower future reproductive value should focus on the
   current reproductive event and take higher risk.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and coping styles are basic concepts for evaluating
   animal welfare. Struggling response of piglets in so-called backtests
   early in life reflects their coping strategy. Behavioral reactions of
   piglets in backtests have a moderate heritability, but their genetic
   basis largely remains unknown. Here, latency, duration and frequency of
   struggling attempts during one-minute backtests were repeatedly recorded
   of piglets at days 5, 12, 19, and 26. A genome-wide association study
   for backtest traits revealed 465 significant SNPs (FDR <= 0.05) mostly
   located in QTL (quantitative trait locus) regions on chromosome 3, 5, 12
   and 16. In order to capture genes in these regions, 37 transcripts with
   significant SNPs were selected for expressionQTL analysis in the
   hypothalamus. Eight genes (ASGR1, CPAMD8, CTC1, FBXO39, IL19,
   LOC100511790, RAD51B, UBOX5) had cisand five (RANGRF, PER1, PDZRN3,
   SH2D4B, LONP2) had trans-expressionQTL. In particular, for PER1, with
   known physiological implications for maintenance of circadian rhythms, a
   role in coping behavior was evidenced by confirmed association in an
   independent population. For CTC1 a cisexpression QTL and the consistent
   relationship of gene polymorphism, mRNA expression level and backtest
   traits promoted its link to coping style. GWAS and eQTL analyses
   uncovered positional and functional gene candidates for coping behavior.}},

Title = {{Domestication affects the structure, development and stability of
   biobehavioural profiles}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Domestication is an evolutionary process during which the biobehavioural
   profile (comprising e.g. social and emotional behaviour, cognitive
   abilities, as well as hormonal stress responses) is substantially
   reshaped. Using a comparative approach, and focusing mainly on the
   domestic and wild guinea pig, an established model system for the study
   of domestication, we review (a) how wild and domestic animals of the
   same species differ in behaviour, emotion, cognition, and hormonal
   stress responses, (b) during which phases of life differences in
   biobehavioural profiles emerge and (c) whether or not animal
   personalities exist in both the wild and domestic form. Concerning (a),
   typical changes with domestication include increased courtship,
   sociopositive and maternal behaviours as well as decreased aggression
   and attentive behaviour. In addition, domestic animals display more
   anxiety-like and less risk-taking and exploratory behaviour than the
   wild form and they show distinctly lower endocrine stress
   responsiveness. There are no indications, however, that domestic animals
   have diminished cognitive abilities relative to the wild form. The
   different biobehavioural profiles of the wild and domestic animals can
   be regarded as adaptations to the different environmental conditions
   under which they live, i.e., the natural habitat and artificial man-made
   housing conditions, respectively. Concerning (b), the comparison of
   infantile, adolescent and adult wild and domestic guinea pigs shows that
   the typical biobehavioural profile of the domestic form is already
   present during early phases of life, that is, during early adolescence
   and weaning. Thus, differences between the domestic and the wild form
   can be attributed to genetic alterations resulting from artificial
   selection, and likely to environmental influences during the pre- and
   perinatal phase. Interestingly, the frequency of play behaviour does not
   differ between the domestic and wild form early in life, but is
   significantly higher in domesticated guinea pigs at later ages.
   Concerning (c), there is some evidence that personalities occur in both
   wild and domestic animals. However, there may be differences in which
   behavioural domains - social and sexual behaviour, emotionality,
   stress-responsiveness - are consistent over time. These differences are
   probably due to changing selection pressures during domestication.}},

Abstract = {{As more research focuses on behavioral syndromes and their role in
   ecological and evolutionary processes, it is imperative that methods to
   test behavior are valid. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess
   behavior in captive coyotes (Canis latrans) using three methods
   {[}agitation scores, novel object test, and flight-initiation distance
   (FID)] and (2) to determine whether the three tests were correlated
   within individuals to describe behavioral syndromes. Female coyotes had
   higher agitation scores during handling (2.6 +/- A 0.5) than males (1.5
   +/- A 0.3; t = 1.90, p = 0.06): scores ranged from 0 to 8 on a 0-11
   scale. The most common behavior observed was biting at y-stick. Only 27
   \% of males and 10 \% of females approached a novel object within 1 m,
   with females (37.3 +/- A 18.6 s) taking less time than males (136.7 +/-
   A 50.4 s; p = 0.09). There was no difference in the distance at which
   males (17.5 +/- A 4.0 m) and females fled during FID tests (20.7 +/- A
   5.4 m; p = 0.64, n = 30). We found no relationships between FID and
   agitation scores (r (2) = 0.13, p = 0.12) or time to approach a novel
   object and agitation scores (r (2) = 0.001, p = 0.89). There was a
   slightly positive relationship between FID and time to approach a novel
   object (r (2) = 0.15, p = 0.03), but no relationship among all three
   tests (r (2) = 0.15, p = 0.45). Our results suggest a behavioral
   syndrome for boldness and explorations, but these traits are unlikely to
   be coupled with aggression in coyotes. While these three tests may not
   be ideally combined to create a behavioral syndrome in individual
   coyotes, using FID and novel object testing may elucidate a type of
   behavioral syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the fitness effects of animal personality by measuring

   personality trait, (2) whether this trait is connected to survival, and
   (3) whether personality and survival exhibit sex differences. We found
   that activity fulfilled the criteria of personality as individuals had
   consistent between-individual differences over time and across
   situations. Consistent individual differences in activity were
   associated with fitness as the survival probability of active
   individuals was lower, but this did not depend on sex. Our results
   demonstrate that personality exists in I. balthica and support recent
   suggestions that the association between personality and life-history
   traits is a central component in mediating animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent increase in interest in personality in dogs, behavioral
   assays of their behavior have proliferated. There has been particularly
   strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a
   result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in
   puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide
   as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality
   dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we
   used an `expert-categorization' procedure a standardized method often
   used in the course of meta-analyses to identify the subset of those
   assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions
   effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests
   and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine
   personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity,
   aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration,
   fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness,
   trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay
   subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a
   standardized categorization procedure undertaken.independently by six
   expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged
   to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a
   widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test
   batteries. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Canine

Abstract = {{Many working-dog programs assess behavior during a dog's first year of
   life with the aim of predicting success in the field. However, decisions
   about which tests to administer are frequently made on the basis of
   tradition or intuition. This study reports results from a survey given
   to U.S.A.'s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) detection-dog
   handlers (N=34). We categorized and summarized handlers' responses
   regarding traits they felt were important for work. We used this
   criterion analysis to examine the content validity of the TSA's puppy
   tests. Results indicate that 13 of 15 traits that are currently being
   measured are relevant. However, several traits not currently measured
   were identified as being highly important, notably play and off-duty
   calmness. These results provide support that the TSA tests are measuring
   traits relevant to operational search team performance but also
   highlight other traits that may be profitable to assess in this and
   other detection-dog programs.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly common to quantify and describe behavioral variation
   in domestic and wild animals in terms of ``personality{''}. Correlating
   behavioral traits are referred to as personality ``dimensions{''} or
   ``factors{''} and different dimensions have been reported in different
   species. ``Boldness{''} is a well-described personality dimension in
   several species, although some issues remain unclear. Previous models of
   boldness include both novelty and risk taking, but recent studies
   indicate that these types of behaviors may reflect separate personality
   dimensions. In this study, we developed a behavioral test battery for
   domestic rabbits, and recorded behaviors of 61 individuals in four
   different situations (novel object, novel arena, social, and predator
   interactions). We used domestic rabbits as a model because behavioral
   variation in rabbits has rarely been quantified in terms of personality
   dimensions, although rabbit behavior is described. We also wanted to
   investigate behavioral variation in a Swedish rabbit breed of
   conservation concern - the Gotland rabbit. Factor analysis of the
   behavioral test measures suggested three personality dimensions:
   ``exploration{''}, ``boldness{''}, and ``anxiety{''}. Novel object
   scores clustered in the exploration and boldness factors, whereas scores
   associated with predator interactions were explained by ``anxiety{''},
   indicating that novel object and anti-predator behavior reflect
   different personality dimensions in rabbits.}},

Abstract = {{Covariation of individual responses to different fear-eliciting
   situations is expected to manifest in general ``fearfulness
   syndrome.{''} We tested for the existence of such a syndrome in
   wild-caught captive greenfinches. We assessed the propensity to give
   distress calls at handling, latency to feed at the presence of a
   predator image, and changes in locomotor activity in response to
   distress calls of conspecifics. Additionally, we measured the frequency
   of flapping flight movements against cage bars and tendency to damage
   tail feathers in captivity as indicators of the ability of birds to cope
   with captive conditions. As a proxy of neuroendocrine activity (an
   expected covariate of fearfulness), we measured the amount of stress
   hormone corticosterone deposited into feathers grown during captivity.
   All the behavioral traits were individually repeatable in time, but
   there were no correlations between them. Lack of the behavioral syndrome
   for fearfulness was also revealed by structural equation modelling. The
   findings of this experiment challenge the concept of a single internal
   variable responsible for fearfulness and support the proposed
   multidimensional nature of fear responses.}},

Title = {{A proposal for assessing individual differences in behaviour during
   early development in the domestic cat}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing interest among biologists in animal personality,
   including in applied contexts, there have been few developmental studies
   of how and when differences in animal personality arise. And yet,
   efficient detection of personality differences early in development
   could be useful in selecting individuals for various management
   purposes. In a first step towards addressing this, we report results of
   a study of individual differences in general motor activity among
   littermates of the domestic cat, obtained using an observational method
   designed to overcome the difficulties of evaluating the behaviour of
   newborn altricial young. Three litters (14 kittens) were filmed in the
   absence of the mother at regular intervals across the 1st postnatal
   (pre-weaning) month. Six untrained observers independently viewed 10
   videos for each litter and ranked the kittens in each video from the
   least to the most active. Significant differences were found between at
   least some kittens in all three litters (Friedman tests: F-r=16.3, 25.8,
   11.3; P<0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0085, respectively), and there was significant
   agreement on kitten ranks among the six observers (Kendall coefficients
   of concordance: W=0.84, 0.84, 0.55; P<0.01 for the three litters,
   respectively). There was also significant agreement between the results
   of two observers using the ranking method and a quantitative method of
   behavioural assessment (Spearman rank order correlation: r(s)=0.93,
   P=0.001). We conclude that stable individual differences in general
   motor activity, possibly indicating differences in temperament, are
   present in kittens early in development, and that ranking the degree of
   such behaviour in a naturalistic setting provides a valid and efficient
   method of detecting such differences. It is now necessary to investigate
   if such early differences are predictive of later behavioural
   phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Theoretically Based Model of Rat Personality with Implications for
   Welfare}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{As animal personality research becomes more central to the study of
   animal behavior, there is increasing need for theoretical frameworks
   addressing its causes and consequences. We propose that regulatory focus
   theory (RFT) could serve as one such framework while also providing
   insights into how animal personality relates to welfare. RFT
   distinguishes between two types of approach motivation: promotion, the
   motivation to approach gains, and prevention, the motivation to approach
   or maintain safety. Decades of research have established the utility of
   RFT as a model of human behavior and recent evidence from zoo- housed
   primates and laboratory rats has suggested that it may be applicable to
   nonhuman animal behavior as well. Building on these initial studies, we
   collected data on 60 rats, Rattus norvegicus, navigating an automated
   maze that allowed individuals to maintain darkness (indicative of
   prevention/ safety-approach motivation) and/ or activate food rewards
   (indicative of promotion/ gain-approach motivation). As predicted, both
   behaviors showed stable individual differences (Ps < 0.01)and were
   inversely associated with physiological signs of chronic stress,
   possibly indicating poor welfare (Ps < 0.05). Subsequently, half the
   rats were exposed to a manageable threat (noxious novel object) in the
   homecage. Re-testing in the maze revealed that threat exposure increased
   darkness time achieved (P, 0.05), suggesting a mechanism by which
   prevention motivation may be enhanced. These results point toward the
   potential utility of RFT as a model for animal behavior and welfare.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Individual specialization can influence important ecological and
   evolutionary traits and both inter- and intra-individual variation in
   resource use can drive niche shifts in natural populations. We evaluated
   the predominance of these two factors for determining seasonal
   differences in the trophic niche of the didelphid marsupial Gracilinanus
   agilis (Burmeister, 1854) in the highly seasonal Brazilian savanna. In
   the three sampled sites, the population of G. agilis increased its
   dietary niche width in the warm-wet season, when food resources are more
   abundant, and there were no differences between sexes and no interaction
   between season and sex. However, the evaluation of intra-individual
   variation indicated that females reduce the number of items consumed
   during the warm-wet season, whereas males show no seasonal differences.
   Inter-individual variation nonetheless followed the overall population
   pattern because both sexes increased their spread with respect to
   food-item consumption in the warm-wet season. Additionally, we found
   positive relationships between body length and diet only in the warm-wet
   season, when larger animals fed more on invertebrates and less on fruits
   than the small ones. Our results show a previously unknown pattern for
   mammals, in which the trophic niche is wider during the high-resource
   season as a result of inter-individual variation along the body-size
   axis. (c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the

Title = {{Physiological, Behavioral and Maternal Factors That Contribute to Size
   Variation in Larval Amphibian Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a
   pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions
   between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and
   maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have
   been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations,
   teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates
   remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these
   interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also
   requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the
   relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors,
   neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and
   metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel
   experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions,
   hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and
   maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development
   in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within
   experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was
   associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food
   restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage
   among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a

Abstract = {{While behavioural plasticity is considered an adaptation to fluctuating
   social and environmental conditions, many animals also display a high
   level of individual consistency in their behaviour over time or across
   contexts (generally termed `personality'). However, studies of animal
   personalities that include sexual behaviour, or functionally distinct
   but correlated traits, are relatively scarce. In this study, we tested
   for individual behavioural consistency in courtship and exploratory
   behaviour in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two light
   environments (high vs. low light intensity). Based on previous work on
   guppies, we predicted that males would modify their behaviour from sneak
   mating tactics to courtship displays under low light conditions, but
   also that the rank orders of courtship effort would remain unchanged
   (i.e. highly sexually active individuals would display relatively high
   levels of courtship under both light regimes). We also tested for
   correlations between courtship and exploratory behaviour, predicting
   that males that had high display rates would also be more likely to
   approach a novel object. Although males showed significant consistency
   in their exploratory and mating behaviour over time (1 week), we found
   no evidence that these traits constituted a behavioural syndrome.
   Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we found no overall effect of
   the light environment on any of the behaviours measured, although males
   responded to the treatment on an individual-level basis, as reflected by
   a significant individual-by-environment interaction. The future
   challenge is to investigate how individual consistency across different
   environmental contexts relates to male reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, individual variation in personality has become a focus of
   behavioral research in animal systems. Boldness and shyness, often

   personality traits important to the fitness landscape of individuals.
   Here we tested for individual differences within and across contexts in
   behavioral responses of captive mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) to
   novel objects, novel foods, and handling. We report consistent
   differences in behavioral responses for objects and handling. We also
   found that the responses to handling and novel objects were correlated
   and repeatable. Lastly, we show that shyer individuals may show less
   variability in their behavioral responses. This study provides new
   information on the potential for behavioral syndromes in this species
   and highlights differences in the degree to which behavioral types
   (e.g., shy/bold) vary in their behavioral responses.}},

Title = {{Repeated Recent Aggressive Encounters Do Not Affect Behavioral
   Consistency in Male Siamese Fighting Fish}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{351-359}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior suggest that individuals
   respond in a predictable and repeatable manner in a specific situation
   while differing from other individuals. Male Siamese fighting fish
   exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies
   when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously.
   However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is
   unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on
   behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with
   paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain
   a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive
   contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies
   after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive
   behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of
   female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an
   increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that
   only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before
   encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the
   dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited
   similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced
   with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while
   winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not
   influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that
   consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be
   resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days.}},

Abstract = {{A long standing question in evolutionary biology concerns the
   maintenance of adaptive combinations of traits in the presence of
   recombination. This problem may be solved if positive epistasis selects
   for reducing the rate of recombination between such traits, but this
   requires sufficiently strong epistasis. Here we use a model that we
   developed previously to analyze a frequency-dependent strategy game in
   asexual populations, to study how adaptive combinations of traits may be
   maintained in the presence of recombination when epistasis is too weak
   to select for genetic linkage. Previously, in the asexual case, our
   model demonstrated the evolution of adaptive associations between social
   foraging strategies and learning rules. We verify that these adaptive
   associations, which are represented by different two-locus haplotypes,
   can easily be broken by genetic recombination. We also confirm that a
   modifier allele that reduces the rate of recombination fails to evolve
   (due to weak epistasis). However, we find that under the same conditions
   of weak epistasis, there is an alternative mechanism that allows an
   association between traits to evolve. This is based on a genetic switch
   that responds to the presence of one social foraging allele by
   activating one of the two alternative learning alleles that are carried
   by all individuals. We suggest that such coordinated phenotypic
   expression by genetic switches offers a general and robust mechanism for
   the evolution of adaptive combinations of traits in the presence of
   recombination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the hypotheses that a bold-shy personality axis exists
   in the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) and that dietary
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation has a significant effect on
   budgerigar personality and immune responses. DHA is an integral
   component of the brain known to impact cognitive function, and its
   impact on budgerigar behaviour is previously unstudied. Adult
   budgerigars (14 females, 9 males) were housed in two home pens and
   received either a control diet or a diet supplemented with DHA. The
   birds were tested in seven experimental situations designed to gauge
   boldness. Behavioural responses within the categories of fear, feeding
   and activity were recorded as well as immune status. Our results suggest
   that dietary DHA supplementation had no effects on the behavioural and
   immune variables measured in this study. The results do suggest that
   budgerigars have bold-shy personality traits for their activity and
   feeding behaviours, as indicated by significant correlations between
   percent of locations in the central area of the open field with activity
   in the presence of the familiar flock in the tendency to flock test
   (r(s) = 0.754, N=9, P<0.05), net distance travelled in the open field
   with activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock in the tendency to
   flock test (r(s) = -0.812, N=8, P<0.05), activity in the presence of the
   familiar flock and activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock
   (r(s) = 0.838, N=10, P<0.05) and the number of seeds eaten alone and the
   number of seeds eaten in competition, both in the foraging and
   competition test (r(s) = 0.770, N = 11, P<0.05). Additionally,
   significant correlations between open field activity variables and fear
   variables measuring latencies may indicate that activity and fear
   variables are related. Finally, although there were several significant
   correlations between immune parameters and behavioural variables, the
   results were inconsistent with the hypothesis that immune status and
   personality are related in the budgerigar. In summary, our results
   indicate that DHA at the levels used had no effects on budgerigar
   personality or immune status. However, the results do provide evidence
   to support the hypothesis that budgerigar personality occurs as a
   bold-shy axis since budgerigars behaved consistently with regard to
   activity levels and, for males, feeding behaviour. Females showed a
   higher innate immunity as measured by the bactericidal activity of whole
   blood, while in males, this parameter was related to feeding behaviour.

Abstract = {{Individual differences in cognitive ability are predicted to covary with
   other behavioural traits such as exploration and boldness. Selection
   within different habitats may act to either enhance or break down
   covariance among traits; alternatively, changing the environmental
   context in which traits are assessed may result in plasticity that
   alters trait covariance. Pond snails, Lymnaea stagnalis, from two
   laboratory strains (more than 20 generations in captivity) and F1
   laboratory reared from six wild populations were tested for long-term
   memory and exploration traits (speed and thigmotaxis) following
   maintenance in grouped and isolated conditions to determine if
   isolation: (i) alters memory and exploration; and (ii) alters covariance
   between memory and exploration. Populations that demonstrated strong
   memory formation (longer duration) under grouped conditions demonstrated
   weaker memory formation and reduced both speed and thigmotaxis following
   isolation. In wild populations, snails showed no relationship between
   memory and exploration in grouped conditions; however, following
   isolation, exploration behaviour was negatively correlated with memory,
   i.e. slow-explorers showing low levels of thigmotaxis formed stronger
   memories. Laboratory strains demonstrated no covariance among
   exploration traits and memory independent of context. Together these
   data demonstrate that the relationship between cognition and exploration
   traits can depend on both habitat and context-specific trait plasticity.

   scientific field. Much research has been conducted to assess distinctive
   individual differences in behavior in a large number of species in the
   past few decades, and increasing numbers of studies include farm
   animals. Nevertheless, the terminology and definitions used in this
   broad scientific field are often confusing because different concepts
   and methods are used to explain often synonymously applied terms, such
   as personality, temperament and coping style. In the present review we
   give a comprehensive overview of the concepts and terms currently used
   in animal personality research and critically reveal how they are
   defined and what they measure. First, we shortly introduce concepts
   describing human personality and how these concepts are used to explain
   animal personality. Second, we present which concepts, methods and
   measures are applied in farm animal personality research and show that
   the terminology used seems to be somehow species-related. Finally, we
   discuss some findings on the possible impact of personality on the
   welfare of farm animals. The assessment of personality in farm animals
   is of growing scientific and practical interest. Differences in
   theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches may also entail the
   diverse use of the different concepts between basic and applied research
   approaches. We conclude that more consistency is needed in using
   different theoretical concepts, terms and measures, especially in farm
   animal personality research. The terms coping style and temperament,
   which are used in different ways, should not be examined as independent
   concepts, but rather should be considered as different aspects of the
   whole personality concept. Farm animal personality should be
   increasingly considered for the improvement of animal housing,
   management, breeding and welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour is a key interface between an animal's genome and its
   environment. Repeatable individual differences in behaviour have been
   extensively documented in animals, but the molecular underpinnings of
   behavioural variation among individuals within natural populations
   remain largely unknown. Here, we offer a critical review of when
   molecular techniques may yield new insights, and we provide specific
   guidance on how and whether the latest tools available are appropriate
   given different resources, system and organismal constraints, and
   experimental designs. Integrating molecular genetic techniques with
   other strategies to study the proximal causes of behaviour provides
   opportunities to expand rapidly into new avenues of exploration. Such
   endeavours will enable us to better understand how repeatable individual
   differences in behaviour have evolved, how they are expressed and how
   they can be maintained within natural populations of animals.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of individual differences in cognition have been studied
   empirically and systematically in the last decade, but causes and
   consequences of this variation are still largely unclear. A recent
   hypothesis suggests that one predictor of individual variation in
   cognition is personality, and specifically that personality types are
   linked to cognitive styles through a speed-accuracy trade-off. We tested
   specific predictions of this hypothesis, measuring individual
   differences in associative learning speed and flexibility, quantified
   via reversal learning, of 86 bank voles, Myodes glareolus, along with
   their activity and boldness. We found that bolder and more active
   individuals were fast, inflexible and persistent in the associative
   learning tasks, whereas shyer and less active individuals were slow and
   flexible. We also found evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off: correct
   choices in the cognitive tasks required more time for all individuals
   compared to incorrect choices, but bolder, more active voles always made
   their decisions faster than reactive ones. The difference between the
   time required for a correct and an incorrect choice was most pronounced
   in initial learning for shyer and less active individuals, but for
   bolder, more active individuals it was most pronounced in the reversal
   learning task. We also found differences related to sex and age: females
   were faster than males to update information or correct incorrect
   choices and older animals took longer to initiate the test. Our results
   confirm the hypothesis that individual differences in behaviour are
   reflected in different `cognitive styles', differentially trading off
   speed for flexibility and accuracy in cognitive tasks. Moreover, we
   provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of such a trade-off in a
   small mammal. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing individual variation in parental care is critical to
   understanding how selection shapes and maintains patterns of care, yet
   little is known about how individual parents vary in their responses to
   the environment. Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes
   change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework
   for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a
   reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which
   describes variation within an individual through time, and personality,
   which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain
   individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish
   Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability
   influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss
   the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in
   parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a
   low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored.
   Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two
   resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their
   behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual
   variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual
   reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at
   the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms
   generating individual variation. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Given their backgrounds in classical ethology and in comparative
   psychology, researchers who study animal personality in biology and
   psychology, respectively, differ in how they measure personality, what
   questions they see as important, and how they address these questions.
   Despite these differences, both comparative psychologists and biologists
   embrace personality traits. By doing so, they have solved empirical and
   conceptual problems in animal behavior. Studies of animal personality
   have provided answers to questions about the evolution of human
   personality and have presented conceptual and empirical anomalies for
   sociocognitive theories. Animal personality research does not break from
   trait theories of personality. Instead, it enriches trait theories by
   conceiving of traits as not belonging to a species, but as expressed,
   with some modifications, across species. Broadening trait theory in this
   way has the potential to further enhance its ability to answer questions
   related to animal and human personality.}},

Title = {{Does it always pay to defend one's nest? A case study in African penguin}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-83}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive
   success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental
   conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain
   unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed
   rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand
   among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have
   highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding
   success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual
   behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per
   behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding
   seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay,
   South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in
   penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian
   approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the
   trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in
   African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold,
   mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their
   breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015
   and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to
   nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly
   influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most
   successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially
   apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher
   energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents
   grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend
   their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression
   when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food
   availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context
   of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent,
   risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be
   reduced in African penguins.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variability is increasingly assessed through functional
   response and effect traits, which provide a mechanistic framework for
   investigating how an organism responds to varying ecological factors and
   how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. Covariation between
   response and effect traits has been poorly examined at the intraspecific
   level, thus hampering progress in understanding how phenotypic
   variability alters the role of organisms in ecosystems. Using a
   multi-trait approach and a nine-month longitudinal monitoring of
   individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated
   that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially
   stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect
   traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome,
   respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using
   a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response
   syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important
   ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter
   decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling
   population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is
   likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of
   phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels
   of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and
   evolutionary ecology.}},

Abstract = {{To provide reliable information about individual-specific
   characteristics, sexual signals should be consistently displayed within
   an individual at least within a particular social context or time
   window. However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme
   within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To
   investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific
   attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the
   repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes
   (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size
   showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all
   temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an
   individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent
   environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length,
   mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and
   within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25)
   that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental
   effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest
   boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than
   those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the
   characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are
   sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to
   the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic
   signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of
   information can be conveyed to the receivers.
   Significance statement
   We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared
   flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal
   contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that
   repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a
   decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was
   confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because
   individuals that changed residency between days sang with less
   consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that
   pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In
   general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the
   signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or
   environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals
   determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual
   quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the reactivity of the endocrine stress axis is thought to
   underlie aspects of persistent individual differences in behavior (i.e.
   animal personality). Previous studies, however, have focused largely on
   estimating baseline or peak levels of glucocorticoids (CORT), often in
   captive animals. In contrast, the temporal dynamics of the HPA axis-how
   quickly it turns on and off, for example may better indicate how an
   individual copes with stressors. Moreover, these HPA components might be
   correlated, thereby representing endocrine suites. Using wild-caught
   great tits (Parus major) we tested birds for exploratory behavior using
   a standardized novel environment assay that serves as a validated proxy
   for personality. We then re-captured a subset of these birds (n = 85)
   and characterized four components of HPA physiology: baseline,
   endogenous stress response, a dexamethasone (DEX) challenge to estimate
   the strength of negative feedback, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone
   (ACTH) challenge to estimate adrenal capacity. We predicted that these
   four HPA responses would be positively correlated and that less
   exploratory birds would have a more rapid onset of the stress response
   (a CORT elevation during the baseline bleed) and weaker negative
   feedback (higher CORT after DEX). We found support for the first two
   predictions but not the third. All four components were positively
   correlated with each other and less exploratory birds exhibited an
   elevation in CORT during the baseline bleed (<3 min from capture). Less
   exploratory birds, however, did not exhibit weaker negative feedback
   following the DEX challenge, but did exhibit weaker adrenal capacity.
   Together, our findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that
   the temporal reactivity of the HPA axis is linked with consistent
   individual differences in behavior, with more cautious (slower
   exploring) individuals exhibiting a faster CORT response. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The idea of animals possessing personalities was once dismissed by the
   scientific community, but has since gained traction with evidence for
   potential application to improve captive animal management and welfare.
   Although domestic cats are popular companion animals, research has
   tended to overlook the value of personality assessment for management
   and care of pet cats. The aim of this study was to investigate
   personality in a large sample of pet cats with a view to understanding
   practical implications for pet cats in the home. Personality of 2,802
   pet cats, from South Australia and New Zealand, was rated by their
   owners utilising a survey measuring 52 personality traits. Five reliable
   personality factors were found using principal axis factor analysis:
   Neuroticism, Extraversion, Dominance, Impulsiveness and Agreeableness.
   Implications for the `Feline Five' are discussed in relation to their
   potential application to improving the management and welfare of pet
   cats. Highly Impulsive cats for example, may be reacting to something
   stressful in their environment, whereas cats with low Agreeableness
   scores, showing irritability may indicate underlying pain or illness.
   Thus, the need for a systematic and holistic approach to personality
   that includes both the individual pet cat and its environment is
   recommended, and opens the door to future interdisciplinary
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Group living has been proposed to yield benefits that enhance fitness
   above the level that would be achieved through living as solitary
   individuals. Dominance hierarchies occur commonly in these social
   assemblages, and result, by definition, in resources not being evenly
   distributed between group members. Determinants of rank within a
   dominance hierarchy can be associated with morphological
   characteristics, previous experience of the individual, or personality
   traits such as exploration tendencies. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate whether greater exploration and positive responses to novel
   objects in homing pigeons (Columba livia) measured under laboratory
   conditions were associated with (i) greater initial exploration of the
   local area around the home loft during spontaneous exploration flights
   (SEF), (ii) faster and more efficient homing flights when released from
   further afield, and (iii) whether the traits of greater exploration and
   more positive responses to novel objects were more likely to be
   exhibited by the more dominant individuals within the group. There was
   no relationship between laboratory-based novel object exploration and
   position within the dominance hierarchy. Pigeons that were neophobic
   under laboratory conditions did not explore the local area during SEF
   opportunities. When released from sites further from home, neophobic
   pigeons took longer routes to home compared to those birds that had not
   exhibited neophobic traits under laboratory conditions, and had
   spontaneously explored to a greater extent. The lack of exploration in
   the neophobic birds is likely to have resulted in the increased costs of
   homing following release: unfamiliarity with the landscape likely led to
   the greater distances travelled and less efficient routes taken. Birds
   that demonstrated a lack of neophobia were not the dominant individuals
   inside the loft, and thus would have less access to resources such as
   food and potentially mates. However, a lack of neophobia makes the
   subordinate position possible, because subordinate birds that incur high
   travel costs would become calorie restricted and lose condition. Our
   results address emerging questions linking individual variation in
   behaviour with energetics and fitness consequences.

Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{119-131}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ consistently in their behaviour. Such
   individual differences may represent adaptations. Recently, researchers
   have started to implement the same adaptive framework to individual
   differences in cognition, leading to the suggestion that personality and
   cognition should covary. To determine the contextual consistency of
   cognitive traits and their covariation with several personality traits,
   24 guinea pigs, Cavia aperea f. porcellus, were tested using a battery
   of 12 cognitive tests. Four tests each were conducted to test for
   problem solving, association learning and social learning. We assessed
   consistency within each of these three domains and tested for cognitive
   and behavioural syndromes between domains. Problem solving and social
   learning were consistent across contexts and positively correlated with
   each other. In addition, both correlated positively with boldness, and
   problem solving showed a negative correlation with aggressiveness and
   sociopositive behaviour. Association learning was neither consistent nor
   correlated with personality or performance in the other cognition tasks.
   We showed contextual consistency of two cognitive traits and found
   multiple links to personality traits that were predicted by recent
   theory. Surprisingly, associative learning was not consistent,
   demonstrating the importance of testing the relation between personality
   and multiple cognitive traits to increase our understanding of
   individual variation in cognition and personality. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{In an ever-changing environment, the ability to adapt choices to new
   conditions is essential for daily living and ultimately, for survival.
   Behavioural flexibility allows animals to maximise survival and
   reproduction in novel settings by adjusting their behaviour based on
   specific information and feedback acquired in their current
   environments. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that an
   individual's personality type can limit the extent to which the
   individual might behave flexibly, by influencing the way an individual
   pays attention to novelty and how much information it collects and
   stores, which in turn affects the individual's decision-making and
   learning process. In this study, the behavioural flexibility of a
   generalist predator, the Chimango Caracara, Milvago chimango, was
   analysed using the reversal learning paradigm, focusing on the
   comparison between age classes, and the relation of learning flexibility
   with a personality trait, the level of neophobia. Due to the low number
   of male individuals captured, this study was carried out only with
   female birds. The results showed that age had no significant effect
   either on the acquisition of a stimulus-reward association, or on the
   capacity of reversing this previously learned association. Reversal of
   the response was a harder task for these birds in comparison with the
   initial acquisition process. The individual's performances in the
   learning tasks seemed to be uncorrelated with each other, suggesting
   that they involve different neural mechanisms. Contrary to the general
   pattern observed in the majority of previous work on personality and
   cognition in non-human animals, the level of neophobia did not correlate
   with the initial associative learning performance in both adults and
   juveniles, yet it showed a significant negative relationship with
   reversal learning ability, mainly in the regressive phase of this task,
   for the two age classes. Our results suggest that the predatory and
   generalist lifestyle of female individuals of M. chimango along with the
   selective pressures of the environment of the individuals studied might
   play a critical role in the degree and direction of the linkage between
   novelty response and learning flexibility observed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from a growing number of organisms suggests that individuals
   show consistent performance differences in cognitive tasks. According to
   empirical and theoretical studies, these cognitive differences might be
   at least partially related to personality. We tested this hypothesis in
   the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, by comparing individuals with different
   degree of sociability in the discrimination of shoals formed by a
   different number of conspecifics. We found that individual guppies show
   repeatability of sociability as expected for personality traits.
   Furthermore, individuals with higher sociability showed poorer shoal
   size discrimination performance and were less efficient in choosing the
   larger shoal compared to individuals with low sociability. As choosing
   the larger shoal is an important strategy of defense against predators
   for guppies, we discuss this relationship between personality and
   cognition in the light of its fitness consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the stability of animal personalities has become a major goal
   of behavioral ecologists. Most personality studies have utilized
   solitary individuals, but little is known on the extent that individuals
   retain their personality across ecologically relevant group settings. We
   conducted a field survey which determined that mud crabs, Panopeus
   herbstii, remain scattered as isolated individuals on degraded oyster
   reefs while high quality reefs can sustain high crab densities (> 10
   m(-2)). We examined the impact of these differences in social context on
   personality by quantifying the boldness of the same individual crabs
   when in isolation and in natural cohorts. Crabs were also exposed to
   either a treatment of predator cues or a control of no cue throughout
   the experiment to assess the strength of this behavioral reaction norm.
   Crabs were significantly bolder when in groups than as solitary
   individuals with predator cue treatments exhibiting severally reduced
   crab activity levels in comparison to corresponding treatments with no
   predator cues. Behavioral plasticity depended on the individual and was
   strongest in the presence of predator cues. While bold crabs largely
   maintained their personality in isolation and group settings, shy crabs
   would become substantially bolder when among conspecifics. These results
   imply that the shifts in crab boldness were a response to changes in
   perceived predation risk, and provide a mechanism for explaining
   variation in behavioral plasticity. Such findings suggest that habitat
   degradation may produce subpopulations with different behavioral
   patterns because of differing social interactions between individual
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the promotion and regulation of circadian rhythms in
   marine fishes is important for studies spanning conservation,
   evolutionary biology, and physiology. Given numerous challenges inherent
   to quantifying behavioral activity across the full spectrum of marine
   environments and fish biodiversity, case studies offer a tractable means
   of gaining insights or forecasting broad patterns of diel activity. As
   these studies continue to accumulate, assessing whether, and to what
   extent, the cumulatively collected data are biased in terms of
   geography, habitat, or taxa represents a fundamentally important step in
   the development of a broad overview of circadian rhythms in marine fish.
   As such investigations require a phylogenetic framework, general trends
   in the phylogenetic sampling of marine fishes should be simultaneously
   assessed for biases in the sampling of taxa and trait data. Here, we
   compile diel activity data for more than 800 marine species from more
   than five decades of scientific studies to assess general patterns of
   bias. We found significant geographic biases that largely reflect a
   preference toward sampling warm tropical waters. Additionally, taxonomic
   biases likewise reflect a tendency toward conspicuous reef associated
   clades. Placing these data into a phylogenetic framework that includes
   all known marine fishes revealed significant under-dispersion of
   behavioral data and taxon sampling across the whole tree, with a few
   subclades exhibiting significant overdispersion. In total, our study
   illuminates substantial gaps in our understanding of diel activity
   patterns and highlights significant sampling biases that have the
   potential to mislead evolutionary or ecological analyses.}},

Title = {{Mate choice based on behavioural type: do convict cichlids prefer
   similar partners?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{281-291}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In monogamous species that provide biparental care, partners with
   similar behavioural types generally have a better reproductive success
   than dissimilar ones. The pattern of assortative mating for behavioural
   type is thus often interpreted as resulting from a mate choice process.
   However, an alternative process is also possible when the partners
   become similar through postpairing adjustments (behavioural
   convergence). The disentanglement of these two nonexclusive mechanisms
   is an important evolutionary question. Only sexual selection based on
   behavioural similarity before pairing can explain the maintenance of the
   behavioural type variability. In a previous study, we reported the
   existence of behavioural convergence for aggressiveness between partners
   in convict cichlids Amatitlania siquia, a monogamous tropical fish. We
   tested herein the assumption of mate choice based on behavioural
   similarity for aggressiveness using either short-term binary choice or
   long-term group level pairing. Pairing was not based on behavioural
   similarity between potential partners. Choosing a behaviourally
   compatible partner is a complex task because it requires profiling the
   potential mates. Individuals would thus achieve higher fitness benefits
   from choosing a partner on more conspicuous criteria (such as size for
   instance) and then attempt to increase partner similarity by convergence
   after pairing. Sexual selection does not appear to drive the maintenance
   of aggressiveness type variability in convict cichlids. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{There has been an increasing interest in consistent interindividual
   differences in behavior (i.e., personality) in recent years. However,
   consistent interindividual differences in cognitive styles remain
   largely unexplored. Individual differences in cognitive styles are
   hypothesized to be functionally related to differences in personality
   types. It is assumed that proactive individuals make faster decisions at
   the expense of accuracy (i.e., the speed-accuracy trade-offs
   hypothesis). Here, we investigated the relationship between personality
   and speed-accuracy trade-off using Portia labiata, a specialized
   spider-eating jumping spider that exhibits excellent cognitive ability.
   We first established consistent individual differences in aggressiveness
   and decision-making in P. labiata. We then tested whether individual
   differences in aggressiveness could predict how fast and accurately P.
   labiata makes a prey-choice decision (a large vs. a small orb-web
   spider). We demonstrated that P. labiata exhibited individual
   differences not only in aggressiveness, but also in the speed of
   prey-choice decisions but not in the choices. Importantly, we found that
   aggressiveness was not related to the choice of the prey, but it
   predicted the speed of prey-choice decision: aggressive individuals were
   faster to make choices than docile ones but both chose large spiders as
   preferred prey. This suggests a lack of an association between a
   speed-accuracy trade-off and variation in personality types of P.
   labiata.}},

Abstract = {{Despite many similarities and intuitive links between individual dietary
   specialization and behavioral inter-individual variation, these
   phenomena have been studied in isolation, and empirical data confirming
   relationships between these intraspecific variance sources are lacking.
   Here we use stable isotope analysis and acoustic telemetry to test the
   hypothesis that individual specialization in trophic (delta N-15) and
   littoral/pelagic prey reliance (delta C-13) covary with inter-individual
   variation in movement in a group of 34 free-swimming burbot (Lota lota).
   By performing stable isotope analysis on tissues with differing isotopic
   turnover rates (anal fin and dorsal muscle), in 24 lethally sampled
   burbot, we demonstrate that individual specialization in trophic niche
   (delta N-15) and littoral/pelagic prey reliance (delta C-13) occurred
   within the population. By performing stable isotope analysis on anal
   fins of a group of telemetry tagged burbot, we were able to show that
   interactions between trophic niche and littoral/pelagic prey reliance,
   explained a significant proportion of the subsequent between-individual
   variance in mean movement rates. These findings demonstrate an empirical
   connection between behavioral inter-individual variation and dietary
   specialization, thus providing a substantial expansion of our
   understanding of the wider ecological consequences of these interesting

Abstract = {{An emerging focus of behavioural ecology is to determine the driving
   forces behind animal personalities. While numerous theories have been
   proposed to explain these behavioural variations, empirical studies on
   this subject remain lacking. Here, we test ecological theory by studying
   the combined effects of physiological condition and habitat quality on
   the behaviour of individual mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, across the
   spawning season (early spawning season and 2 months after). We assessed
   the boldness, energy stores and reproductive effort of crabs collected
   across 10 oyster reefs of low and high quality using laboratory
   observations and subsequent dissections. Crab boldness was significantly
   dependent on the interaction between habitat quality and season. While
   crab behaviour remained relatively constant on healthy reefs, crabs on
   degraded reefs exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in boldness during
   the late spawning season, approximating the boldness of crabs on healthy
   reefs. This behavioural change corresponds to a seasonal shift in crab
   energy store content and is likely to represent a switch in the primary
   driving force of crab behaviour. During the early season, crab boldness
   was positively correlated with short-term stores, whereas later in the
   season, crab boldness was negatively correlated with long-term stores.
   Our results suggest that behaviour is driven by predation pressure and
   refuge availability during the early spawning season, but afterwards
   depends on replenishing energy stores used for reproduction. These
   findings support ecological theory and also provide new insight into the
   stability of behavioural drivers. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{Although the number of studies documenting animal personalities has
   increased over the last decade, ecological validations of animal
   personality traits remain relatively rare in the behavioural ecology
   literature. I examined whether wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus
   pygerythrus, were consistent in their responses to diverse novel
   objects, and tested whether experimentally assayed boldness predicted
   the number of times individuals were observed inspecting naturally
   occurring snakes at close range. Boldness was repeatable across three
   novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number
   of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited
   antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator
   stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections
   predicted approach of this item. Age-sex class differences in boldness
   and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly
   consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder
   than adult females and had higher snake inspection counts. These age-sex
   differences fit well with expected variation in risk-reward ratios of
   exploratory risk-taking behaviour considered within a life history
   framework for this species. The results of this study provide a crucial
   ecological validation of using novel object tests to assay boldness in a
   wild primate. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several studies report a correlation between exploratory behaviour and
   performance on tests of cognitive ability. Exploration may influence
   learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in
   contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information
   available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of
   exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine
   the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to
   examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality.
   Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess
   repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to
   discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90 degrees
   (vertical, the S+) and 135 degrees (the S-). After training pigeons
   underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line
   orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to
   generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization
   gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the
   direction towards the S-. These results suggest that birds with
   different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned
   information. Further testing is needed to confirm which cue(s) (S+ or
   S-) control the behaviour of fast-explorers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Food and vitamin D-3 availability affects lizard personalities: an
   experiment}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed recently that labile state variables (e.g. energy
   reserves) can have a key role in the development and maintenance of
   consistent between-individual behavioural variation (i.e. animal
   personality) within population. In male Carpetan rock lizards
   (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland
   secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further,
   vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles.
   Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low)
   and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught
   reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile
   components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the
   degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean
   behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all
   treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x
   vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present
   in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i)
   decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter
   use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased
   risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We
   conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both
   behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I.
   cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural
   consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general.
   Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy
   reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary
   explanations for the reported patterns.
   Significance statement
   The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent
   between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations
   (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been
   recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed
   the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual
   differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether
   short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults
   is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the
   amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality
   and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected
   the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of
   reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence
   that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal
   personality, and it also affects individual behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{1. Animal personality is defined as the repeatable between-individual
   differences in behaviour over time and contexts. Some personality
   traits, such as activity or aggression, have received much attention
   while other behaviours, such as habitat preference or learning, have
   been neglected.
   2. Wormlion larvae are sit-and-wait dipteran predators that inhabit
   shaded microhabitats in the field and also prefer shade in the
   laboratory. The aim of the present study was to examine wormlion larvae
   behavioural repeatability in general and specifically in the context of
   habitat preference. In order to achieve this, three experiments were
   conducted to determine whether, to what extent and under which
   conditions wormlion preference for shaded microhabitats is repeatable.
   3. Individual tendency to relocate when the environment conditions
   deteriorate was also assessed, by switching between shaded and
   illuminated conditions, either with or without pit destruction.
   4. Larvae showed a highly repeatable preference for shade. Repeatability
   was detected in additional behavioural traits: pit construction, pit
   area and tendency to relocate.
   5. This behavioural repeatability was demonstrated under constant
   microhabitat conditions, with distinct behaviours in each setting. Under
   constant illumination, wormlions constructed smaller pits, moved over
   longer distances and were found at the tray edges more frequently than
   under constant shade conditions, suggesting that illuminated
   environments are perceived as risky or unsuitable.
   6. Switching between the two microhabitat conditions without pit
   destruction induced fewer relocations than switching with pit
   destruction, suggesting that wormlions do not tend to abandon their
   pits, even if their microhabitat conditions deteriorate.}},

Title = {{Individual variation in functional response parameters is explained by

Abstract = {{Functional responses are per-capita feeding rate models whose parameters
   often scale with individual body size but the parameters may also be
   further influenced by behavioural traits consistently differing among
   individuals, i.e. behavioural types or animal personalities. Behavioural
   types may intrinsically lead to lower feeding rates when consistently
   shy, inactive and easily stressed individuals cannot identify or respond
   to risk-free environments or need less food due to lower metabolic rates
   linked to behaviour. To test how much variation in functional response
   parameters is explained by body size and how much by behavioural types,
   we estimated attack rate and handling time individually for differently
   sized female least killifish (Heterandria formosa) and repeatedly
   measured behavioural traits for each individual. We found that
   individual fish varied substantially in their attack rate and in their
   handling time. Behavioural traits were stable over time and varied
   consistently among individuals along two distinct personality axes. The
   individual variation in functional responses was explained solely by
   body size, and contrary to our expectations, not additionally by the
   existing behavioural types in exploration activity and coping style.
   While behavioural trait-dependent functional responses may offer a route
   to the understanding of the food web level consequences of behavioural
   types, our study is so far only the second one on this topic.
   Importantly, our results indicate in contrast to that previous study
   that behavioural types do not per se affect individual functional
   responses assessed in the absence of external biotic stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it
   constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality
   could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It
   is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival
   probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among
   individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social
   niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals
   that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social
   conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the
   social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for
   development after a change in social status. In the facultative
   cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis),
   residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this
   forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to
   test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual
   differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an
   individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young
   individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age
   reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers,
   suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's
   social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will
   be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social
   state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social
   state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However,
   novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive
   state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism
   for generating individual differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Information on where to find food patches, their quality, and food
   variance can have implications for fitness and survival when a current
   food patch fails. Individuals have been found to vary in their response
   to changes in food availability, and this has been related to several
   personality traits in animals such as exploration behavior that measures
   activity in a novel environment. We examined if personality-related
   variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by
   information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in
   investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new
   patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an
   alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express
   variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted
   that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current
   information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we
   designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to
   changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus
   major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food
   patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS
   hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in
   feeder choice in response to changes in food availability, nor
   personality-related differences in flexibility in behavioral responses.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Progress in sociobiology continues to be hindered by abstract debates
   over methodology and the relative importance of within-group vs.
   between-group selection. We need concrete biological examples to ground
   discussions in empirical data. Recent work argued that the levels of
   aggression in social spider colonies are explained by group-level
   adaptation. Here, we examine this conclusion using models that
   incorporate ecological detail while remaining consistent with kin- and
   multilevel selection frameworks. We show that although levels of
   aggression are driven, in part, by between-group selection,
   incorporating universal within-group competition provides a striking fit
   to the data that is inconsistent with pure group-level adaptation.
   Instead, our analyses suggest that aggression is favoured primarily as a
   selfish strategy to compete for resources, despite causing lower group
   foraging efficiency or higher risk of group extinction. We argue that
   sociobiology will benefit from a pluralistic approach and stronger links
   between ecologically informed models and data.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species vary consistently in their behaviour
   across time and context, and this is often referred to as animal
   personality. In this study, we investigate animal personality based on
   the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional
   factors, which are linked to biological internal factors that are stable
   and perhaps heritable. Although not directly measurable, these
   underlying dispositional factors predispose individuals to react through
   different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness
   continuum reflected in the consistency across time of the
   inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards two
   different novelty tests: a novel object test representing non-social
   contexts and a mirror test representing social contexts. Our study
   animals were 60 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised
   in identical housing conditions. We recorded the approach behaviour of
   the mink towards novelty at two different times: the first time during
   non-breeding season in December 2013 and the second time during
   pre-breeding season in February 2014. Behavioural variables were
   analysed using principal component analyses and our results show
   consistency in inter individual variation in shyness measures across
   seasons. This consistency differed across non-social and social contexts
   forming two different shyness-boldness dimensions as were also found
   across context in a previous study. To our knowledge this is the first
   study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum across time
   and season in the American mink from non-breeding season in December to
   pre-breeding season in February. Our study confirms the existence of
   personality in farmed American mink, but interestingly, we saw a shift
   in the positioning of most individuals from shy to more bold on the
   shyness continuum when comparing the December measures to the February
   measures. This shift was further supported by the results of a simple
   stick test, which indicated a change towards a higher responsiveness
   towards humans in the pre-breeding season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Expression of sexually selected signals in many species varies over time
   of day and season. A key model system to study this variation in signal
   expression is birdsong. Yet, despite good ecological understanding of
   why song varies across time of day and season, much of the individual
   variation remains unexplained. Although some of the interindividual
   variation in singing depends on the quality or motivation of an
   individual, it can also vary with other characteristics. Because singing
   has been shown to vary with personality traits in specific contexts,
   personality is thus an important candidate to explain part of the
   variation in seasonal and daily singing. Using a personality-typed field
   population of great tits (Parus major), we here show that singing
   activity peaked at dawn during the fertile period of the females and
   that the association between male personality and singing activity
   depended on the reproductive stage of his mate; faster explorers
   significantly increased in singing activity during main periods of
   fertility and maternal investment (egg laying and incubation). Moreover,
   males with higher singing activity tended to raise more fledglings.
   Increased singing by faster explorers during key periods of female
   reproductive investment suggests that faster explorers are more
   responsive to changes in female reproductive stage, contrasting the
   general view that faster explorers are less responsive to environmental
   and social changes. Most importantly, these findings highlight that
   multiple factors including personality need to be integrated when
   assessing causes of variation of highly variable sexually selected
   signal traits.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{During collective movement, bolder individuals often emerge as leaders.
   Here, we investigate whether this reflects a greater propensity of bold
   individuals to initiate movement, or a preference for shy individuals to
   follow a bolder leader. We set up trios of stickleback fish comprising a
   focal individual who was either bold or shy, and one other individual of
   each personality. We then recorded the movements of all individuals in
   and out of cover in a foraging context to determine how assiduously the
   focal fish followed the movements of each other partner. We found that a
   shy focal fish preferred to follow a leader whose personality matched
   its own, but we did not detect such a difference in bold fish. Despite
   this preference, however, the greater propensity of bold individuals to
   initiate movements out of cover meant that they successfully led more
   joint trips. Thus, when offered a choice of leaders, sticklebacks prefer
   to follow individuals whose personality matches their own, but bolder
   individuals may, nevertheless, be able to impose their leadership, even
   among shy followers, simply through greater effort.}},

Abstract = {{Besides being recognized as a potential welfare indicator, play
   behaviour has long been considered to have immediate and/or long-term
   benefits. In particular, it has been suggested that in play animals
   learn to cope physically and emotionally with unexpected events. Given
   that the propensity to play varies greatly between conspecific
   individuals, such interindividual variability in playfulness may be
   associated with differences in the animals' future behaviour, a
   prediction that has rarely been tested. To investigate whether different
   levels of playfulness in juvenility indeed coincide with behavioural
   differences in later life, 30 female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the
   following series of behavioural observations and tests: (1)
   quantification of juvenile play behaviour; (2) behavioural testing in
   paradigms that assess anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion
   in an unfamiliar environment; and (3) observation of spontaneous
   behaviour in the familiar home cage environment. Surprisingly, a high
   level of juvenile playfulness was predictive of high levels of state
   anxiety and low levels of exploratory locomotion in later life. While
   this relationship existed already in adolescence, it became even more
   prominent in adulthood. By contrast, no substantial differences between
   playful and less playful mice were found with respect to home cage
   behaviour. While these findings may reflect better coping abilities in
   novel and dangerous environments in those mice that played the most
   during juvenility, they may also argue for the existence of different
   types of mice. Thus, despite genetic homogeneity and identical housing
   environments, preferences for either local or global use of space were
   observed that indicate the emergence of individuality. Concerning animal
   welfare, our findings suggest that play may constitute a plausible
   welfare indicator at the population level, but is probably less
   meaningful for the individual. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{In animals, personality variations in response to stress and energy
   demands have been established. Cognitive processing of negative stimuli
   correlates with stress response patterns. Still, the relative
   contribution of cognitive appraisal or physiological demands to the
   behavioural output needs to be clarified. In this study we utilized
   reactive (high-responsive, HR) and proactive (low-responsive, LR)
   rainbow trout strains to investigate how contrasting reactions to
   hypoxia are related to individual variation in metabolism and/or
   cognition. The HR-LR strains did not differ in standard metabolic rate
   or hypoxia tolerance. HR trout displayed more pronounced avoidance to a
   signal cue after being conditioned with hypoxia, suggesting that they
   experienced this stimulus more aversive than LR trout. Together with
   differences in forebrain c-fos activation patterns in dorsomedial
   pallium, these results suggest cognitive differences between the
   strains. These results demonstrate that differences in
   personality/stress coping style can be related to contrasts in
   cognition, which are independent of metabolic differences.}},

   perspective}},

Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tropical rainforests are species-rich, complex ecosystems. They are
   increasingly being negatively affected by anthropogenic activity, which
   is rapidly and unpredictably altering their structure and complexity.
   These changes in habitat state may expose tropical animals to novel and
   unpredictable conditions, potentially increasing their extinction risk.
   However, an animal's ability to cope with environmental change may be
   linked to its personality. While numerous studies have investigated
   environmental influences on animal personalities, few are focused on
   tropical species. In this review, we consider how behavioural syndromes
   in tropical species might facilitate coping under, and adapting to,
   increasing disturbance. Given the complexity of tropical rainforests, we
   first discuss how habitat complexity influences personality traits and
   physiological stress in general. We then explore the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of personality in the tropics in the context
   of behavioural flexibility, range expansion and speciation. Finally, we
   discuss the impact that anthropogenic environmental change may have on
   the ecological integrity of tropical rainforests, positing scenarios for
   species persistence. Maintaining tropical rainforest complexity is
   crucial for driving behavioural flexibility and personality type, both
   of which are likely to be key factors facilitating long term persistence
   in disturbed habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{Social relationships vary in content, quality and patterning. Most
   researchers focus on whether and how nondispositional factors, including
   age, sex, kinship and rank, predict variance in the content, quality and
   patterning of relationships. However, within a species, these factors do
   not always predict partner choice. We examined whether similarity in any
   of five personality traits, Assertiveness, Openness, Neuroticism,
   Sociability and Attentiveness, independently contributed to variation in
   the affiliative and agonistic relationships of pairs of brown capuchin
   monkeys, Sapajus sp. Capuchins that were more similar in Neuroticism had
   higher affiliative relationship scores, while capuchins that were more
   similar in Sociability shared overall higher-quality relationships (i.e.
   the difference between the dyad's affiliative and agonistic scores).
   These effects were independent of age, sex, kinship and rank, suggesting
   that certain aspects of the psychology of these animals may contribute
   uniquely to the quality of their social relationships. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in both public information use, and
   the evolutionary origins and ecological consequences of animal
   personalities but surprisingly little integration of these two fields.
   Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals
   respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first
   step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked
   whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine
   sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were
   scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of
   activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple
   times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were
   required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the
   foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r =
   0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components
   describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be
   related to either of two measures of public information use. While the
   personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public
   information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect
   opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious
   avenue for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour are often consistent across time and
   contexts, but it is not clear whether such consistency is reflected at
   the molecular level. We explored this issue by studying scouting in
   honeybees in two different behavioural and ecological contexts: finding
   new sources of floral food resources and finding a new nest site. Brain
   gene expression profiles in food-source and nest-site scouts showed a
   significant overlap, despite large expression differences associated
   with the two different contexts. Class prediction and `leave-one-out'
   cross-validation analyses revealed that a bee's role as a scout in
   either context could be predicted with 92.5\% success using 89 genes at
   minimum. We also found that genes related to four neurotransmitter
   systems were part of a shared brain molecular signature in both types of
   scouts, and the two types of scouts were more similar for genes related
   to glutamate and GABA than catecholamine or acetylcholine signalling.
   These results indicate that consistent behavioural tendencies across
   different ecological contexts involve a mixture of similarities and
   differences in brain gene expression.}},

   Implications for Between-Individual Differences in Visual Resolution and

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Between-individual variation has been documented in a wide variety of
   taxa, especially for behavioral characteristics; however,
   intra-population variation in sensory systems has not received similar
   attention in wild animals. We measured a key trait of the visual system,
   the density of retinal cone photoreceptors, in a wild population of
   house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We tested whether individuals
   differed from each other in cone densities given within-individual
   variation across the retina and across eyes. We further tested whether
   the existing variation could lead to individual differences in two
   aspects of perception: visual resolution and chromatic contrast. We
   found consistent between-individual variation in the densities of all
   five types of avian cones, involved in chromatic and achromatic vision.
   Using perceptual modeling, we found that this degree of variation
   translated into significant between-individual differences in visual
   resolution and the chromatic contrast of a plumage signal that has been
   associated with mate choice and agonistic interactions. However, there
   was no evidence for a relationship between individual visual resolution
   and chromatic contrast. The implication is that some birds may have the
   sensory potential to perform ``better{''} in certain visual tasks, but
   not necessarily in both resolution and contrast simultaneously. Overall,
   our findings (a) highlight the need to consider multiple individuals
   when characterizing sensory traits of a species, and (b) provide some
   mechanistic basis for between-individual variation in different
   behaviors (i.e., animal personalities) and for testing the predictions
   of several widely accepted hypotheses (e.g., honest signaling).}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour and physiology (i.e. animal
   personality or coping style) has emerged as a central topic in many
   biological disciplines. Yet, underlying mechanisms of crucial
   personality traits like feeding behaviour in novel environments remain
   unclear. Comparative studies, however, reveal a strong degree of
   evolutionary conservation of neural mechanisms controlling such
   behaviours throughout the vertebrate lineage. Previous studies have
   indicated duration of stress-induced anorexia as a consistent individual
   characteristic in teleost fishes. This study aims to determine to what
   degree brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) activity pertains to
   this aspect of animal personality, as a correlate to feed anticipatory
   behaviour and recovery of feed intake after transfer to a novel
   environment. Crucial to the definition of animal personality, a strong
   degree of individual consistency in different measures of feeding
   behaviour (feeding latency and feeding score), was demonstrated.
   Furthermore, low serotonergic activity in the hypothalamus was highly
   correlated with a personality characterized by high feeding motivation,
   with feeding motivation represented as an overall measure incorporating
   several behavioural parameters in a Principle Component Analyses (PCA).
   This study thus confirms individual variation in brain 5-HT
   neurotransmission as a correlate to complex behavioural syndromes
   related to feeding motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are by definition stable over time, but to what
   extent they may change during development and in adulthood to adjust to
   environmental change is unclear. Animals of temperate environments have
   evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the
   cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality:
   suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently
   among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging
   survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality,
   whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction,
   individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the
   effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours
   (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we
   manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to
   simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles
   (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based
   on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles
   allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher
   corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious
   behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and
   allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed
   plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in
   the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those
   staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period
   for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over
   the bold-shy axis.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities have been a major focus of behavioral ecology over
   the past decade. Consistent individual differences in behavior have been
   found across taxa, and have been shown to influence a range of
   ecological processes. The role of personalities in sexual selection has
   been considered, and examples exist that show selection for personality
   traits with both assortative and disassortative mating patterns between
   personality types. One overlooked aspect of the personality and sexual
   selection literature is the potential for personality-signaling
   interactions, specifically with complex signaling. Complex signaling is
   a diverse topic in itself, and in short, consists of multiple signals
   within one or more modalities that interact to elicit a receiver
   response. Research into complex signaling has been thorough, although at
   times studies discover complex signaling systems that fail to fit into
   one of the existing hypotheses in the literature. Here, we argue that
   personalities may interact with complex signaling, which should be
   considered by researchers of both personality and sexual selection and
   communication. We describe several ways in which personality-complex
   signaling interactions could affect both the signaler and receiver, and
   the way in which they may drive personality-specific signals as well as
   receiver preferences. Finally, we discuss how considering personality in
   complex signaling studies may inform theory as well as improve the
   ability of researchers to accurately describe its function.}},

Title = {{Boldness is related to the development of the cephalic crest in the male

Abstract = {{Boldness is defined as the tendency of an individual to take risks when
   exposed to novel objects or situations. The main aim of this work was to
   dilucidate if boldness was related to the development of the secondary
   sexual traits (SSTs) in the male of the river blenny Salaria
   fluviatilis, a freshwater fish which takes care of eggs. As a second
   objective SSTs effect on parental status adoption was also be explored.
   Wild young fish were caught in the Segre River (Ebro basin) in November
   2010. Fish were kept in five aquaria in groups of eight males and eight
   females with artificial nests. Boldness (boldness score and hesitancy)
   of males (initially with little SSTs development) was tested as the time
   required to exit a refuge when exposed to a new environment. Fish were
   mantained in the same aquaria for several months, and males' SSTs
   development and reproductive behaviour were monitored. Boldness score
   was negatively associated to cephalic crest development. Hesitancy was
   negatively related to male length and was also influenced by the
   interaction between male length and cephalic crest. Parental status
   acquisition was positively related to the male's length, marginally
   related to anal gland development, and non-related to cephalic crest.
   These results suggest an intrasexual role of the crest as an informative
   trait of boldness (honest signal) which might not necessarily be chosen
   by the females. It is also discussed that correlational selection could
   be responsible for linking boldness and growth rate in this species.
   Sexual selection, in addition to having directed the evolution of
   secondary sexual traits, might have favored certain personality traits
   (e.g. boldness) associated with the achievement of a larger body length.}},

Abstract = {{Energy expenditure is a key mechanism underlying animal ecology, yet why
   individuals often differ in metabolic rate even under identical
   conditions remains largely unexplained. Individual variation in
   metabolism might be explained by correlations with other behavioral and
   physiological traits, with individual syndromes having environment- or
   state-dependent costs and benefits to fitness. We tested whether social
   rank within herds of female red deer is associated with individual
   differences in resting heart rate, an index of metabolic rate, and
   energetic response to monthly periods of food restriction during winter
   in a large outdoor enclosure near Vienna, Austria. Social rank had a
   strong positive effect on average daily heart rate, independent of the
   effects of food intake, air temperature, body temperature, and body
   mass. Subordinate individuals had lower heart rates than dominants, and
   consequently they suffered lower rates of body mass loss during periods
   of restricted pellet food supply. A greater capacity to minimize energy
   requirements might benefit the survival of subdominant female red deer
   during periods of negative energy balance in winter. Our study provides
   empirical support in a large mammal for linkages in behavior and
   metabolism within individuals that have environment-dependent
   consequences to the energy budget.}},

Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{581-591}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Activity budgets of animals often show consistent differences between
   individuals across time, which qualifies them as personality traits. In
   the case of captive birds, locomotor activity can be divided into two
   major components - frequency of hopping and flapping flight bouts, which
   may conceive different information about individual condition. This idea
   was tested in a 2{*}2 factorial experiment in wild-caught captive
   greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), injected with bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or temporarily exposed to an image of a
   predator. We predicted that LPS injection would reduce both types of
   activity via induction of sickness syndrome and that predator image
   treatment would either increase or decrease different components of
   activity. Both behavioural traits were similarly consistent in time over
   a 10-d period but the correlations between them depended on measurement
   context. LPS treatment reduced flapping and hopping frequencies and
   total locomotor activity. Exposure to the predator image had no effect
   on flapping frequency, but it decreased hopping frequency and total
   locomotor activity among the birds that were initially most active. The
   effects of both treatments on behaviour were relatively long-lasting,
   that is, detectable at least 87h after LPS injection and 44h after
   exposure to the predator image. Our findings demonstrate the existence
   of two components of locomotor activity that responded similarly to the
   physiological but differently to the psychological stressor. The
   distinction between such components thus increases the information
   content of activity recordings of caged birds, which is likely to reveal
   novel aspects of covariation between different aspects of stress
   responsiveness and other performance parameters.}},

Volume = {{150}},

Abstract = {{Sexual cannibalism is often hypothesized to be an extreme manifestation
   of sexual conflict, yet we still lack a good understanding of the
   underlying motivation in most species. Hypotheses for the ultimate
   causes of sexual cannibalism either invoke the behavior as adaptive
   ormal-adaptive. Adaptive hypotheses consider foraging decisions, mate
   choice or genetic bet-hedging. Mal-adaptive hypotheses propose that
   sexual cannibalism is the result of mistaken species identity or the by
   product of an aggression syndrome. Here, we test the latter hypothesis,
   that sexual cannibalism is the result of an aggression syndrome. This
   hypothesis states that aggressive behavior is favored in the foraging
   context because females benefit from achieving a large size quickly
   through an increase in fecundity, and it predicts that individuals that
   are aggressive foragers are more likely to attack a male and hence are
   at risk of receiving no or insufficient quantities of sperm. Few tests
   of this hypothesis are available to date, and only one involved a
   species with sexual cannibalism occurring after at least some sperm
   transfer. We test the hypothesis in Argiope aurantia, a species in which
   females frequently attack males during copulation. We estimated
   aggressiveness in the foraging context in penultimate and adults females
   and staged matings using the same females to evaluate whether
   aggressiveness during the foraging context predicts the likelihood of
   sexual cannibalism. Indeed, we find that aggressive foragers are more
   likely to attack their mates, but we conclude that other, possibly
   adaptive reasons for cannibalism exist as much of the uncertainty in
   cannibalism occurrence remained unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the inter-individual variation observed in animal behaviour is
   now attributed to the existence of behavioural phenotypes or animal
   personalities. Such phenotypes may be fundamental to fisheries and
   aquaculture, yet there have been few detailed studies of this phenomenon
   in exploited marine animals. We investigated the behavioural and
   neuroendocrine responses of Atlantic cod (Gad us morhua L), to
   situations reflecting critical ecological challenges: predator attacks
   and territorial challenges. Both hatchery-reared and wild fish were
   tested and behavioural profiles were compared with baseline conditions.
   We then used an objective, multivariate approach, rather than assigning
   individuals along one-dimensional behavioural axes, to examine whether
   distinct behavioural phenotypes were present. Our results indicate that
   two distinct behavioural phenotypes were evident in fish from each
   background. In hatchery-reared fish, phenotypes displayed divergent
   locomotor activity, sheltering, brain monoamine concentrations and
   responses to competitive challenges. In wild fish, phenotypes were
   distinguished primarily by locomotor activity, sheltering and
   responsiveness to predator stimuli. Hatcheries presumably represent a
   more stressful social environment, and social behaviour and
   neuroendocrine responses were important in discerning behavioural
   phenotypes in hatchery fish, whereas antipredator responses were
   important in discerning phenotypes in wild fish that have previously
   encountered predators. In both fish types, behavioural and physiological
   traits that classified individuals into phenotypes were not the same as
   those that were correlated across situations These results highlight the
   multidimensionality of animal personalities, and that the processes that
   regulate one suite of behavioural traits may be very different to the
   processes that regulate other behaviours. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Individuals are regularly documented to consistently differ in their
   behavioural types (BTs). For example, some individuals are bold whereas
   others are shy. Within the human personality literature, the big five
   personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with
   testosterone suggested to underpin traits such as aggressiveness. In
   non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression
   may be influenced by ecology, mating system and sexual selection. While
   most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious
   species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential
   hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic
   genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary
   male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach
   allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst
   controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both
   secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual
   level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT
   scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and
   were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic
   control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than
   hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to
   sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with
   bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was
   not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous
   developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with
   either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. (c)

Abstract = {{It has been established that various species exhibit personality,
   defined as intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation
   in behavioural phenotypes. For example, certain individuals may
   demonstrate consistently greater behavioural reactions and elevated
   stress responses. We conducted playback experiments and hormonal
   analyses on male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in captivity to
   investigate the patterns and proximate mediators of individual
   variations in behavioural reactions. We found intra-individual
   consistency and inter-individual variation in behavioural reactions
   (intensive vigilance towards the direction of speakers) to vocalisations
   by unfamiliar chimpanzees. This behavioural reaction was positively
   correlated with changes in salivary cortisol concentration, suggesting
   that stress is a proximate factor mediating the variation in behavioural
   reactions. The males who were highly responsive to the conspecific
   vocalisation also exhibited high behavioural reactions towards the
   neutral broadcast stimulus (the jungle crows Corvus macrorhynchos ka
   vocalisation). This observation is consistent with the notion that male
   chimpanzees vary in intrinsic behavioural tendency to different stimuli.}},

   investigate the temporal consistency of SMR. Fish activity in the
   respirometer differed between the species and there was a
   family-specific response to change in illumination. In salmonids,
   switching off the lights resulted in an increased oxygen consumption
   rate for hours, whereas in cyprinids the response was shorter or totally

Title = {{Pace of life syndrome under warming and pollution: integrating life
   history, behavior, and physiology across latitudes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To fully comprehend and predict the impact of drivers of global change
   such as climate warming and pollution, integrated multi-trait approaches
   are needed. As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to
   stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A
   promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS),
   which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and
   physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative
   multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within
   and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and
   metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of
   replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in
   voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every
   two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures.
   Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in
   accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies
   characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative
   and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in
   immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was
   associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher
   vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between
   the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth
   rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this,
   damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic
   correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming
   and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the
   POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which
   aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at
   the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated
   within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the
   fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if
   underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent
   evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain
   adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the
   covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and
   within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive
   evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.}},

   Recent studies in humans and laboratory animals have shown that the

   development. The `gut-brain axis' represents a multi-directional
   signalling system that encompasses neurological, immunological and
   hormonal pathways. In particular it is tightly linked with the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), a system that regulates
   stress hormone release and influences brain development and function.

   infection, stress and exercise, suggests direct effects on cognition,
   including learning and memory. However, our understanding of these
   processes in natural populations is extremely limited. Here, we outline
   how recent advances in predominantly laboratory-based microbiome
   research can be applied to understanding individual differences in
   cognition. Experimental manipulation of the microbiome across natal and
   adult environments will help to unravel the interplay between cognitive
   variation and the gut microbial community. Focus on individual variation
   in the gut microbiome and cognition in natural populations will reveal
   new insight into the environmental and evolutionary constraints that
   drive individual cognitive variation.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Causes and consequences of
   individual differences in cognitive abilities'.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic contaminants could alter traits central to animal
   behavioral types, or personalities, including aggressiveness, boldness
   and activity level. Lead and other toxic metals are persistent inorganic
   pollutants that affect organisms worldwide. Metal exposure can alter
   behavior by affecting neurology, endocrinology, and health. However, the
   direction and magnitude of the behavioral effects of metal exposure
   remain equivocal. Moreover, the degree to which metal exposure
   simultaneously affects suites of correlated behavioral traits
   (behavioral syndromes) that are controlled by common mechanisms remains
   unclear, with most studies focusing on single behaviors. Using a model
   species for personality variation, the great tit (Pants major), we
   explored differences in multiple behavioral traits across a pollution
   gradient where levels of metals, especially lead and cadmium, arc
   elevated close to a smelter. We employed the novel environment
   exploration test, a proxy for variation in personality type, and also
   measured territorial aggressiveness and nest defense behavior. At
   polluted sites birds of both sexes displayed slower exploration
   behavior, which could reflect impaired neurological or physiological
   function. Territorial aggression and nest defense behavior were
   individually consistent, but did not vary with proximity to the smelter,
   suggesting that metal exposure does not concurrently affect exploration
   and aggression. Rather, exploration behavior appears more sensitive to
   metal pollution. Effects of metal pollution on exploration behavior, a
   key animal personality trait, could have critical effects on fitness.

Abstract = {{Consistency of individual differences of animal behavior and personality
   in reactions to various environmental stresses among their life stages
   could reflect basic divergences in coping style which may affect
   survival, social rank, and reproductive success in the wild. However,
   the physiological mechanisms determining personality remain poorly
   understood. In order to study whether behavior, metabolism and
   physiological stress responses relate to the personality, we employed
   post-stress recovery assays to separate zebrafish into two behavioral
   types (proactive and reactive). The results demonstrated consistent
   difference among personality, behavior and metabolism in which proactive
   individuals were more aggressive, had higher standard metabolic rates
   and showed lower shuttled frequencies between dark and light
   compartments than the reactive ones. The behavioral variations were also
   linked to divergent acute salinity stress responses: proactive
   individuals adopted a swift locomotion behavior in response to acute
   salinity challenge while reactive individuals remain unchanged. Our
   results provide useful insight into how personality acts on correlated
   traits and the importance of a holistic approach to understanding the
   mechanisms driving persistent inter-individual differences.}},

Title = {{Energetic fitness: Field metabolic rates assessed via 3D accelerometry
   complement conventional fitness metrics}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1203-1213}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Evaluating the fitness of organisms is an essential step towards
   understanding their responses to environmental change. Connections
   between energy expenditure and fitness have been postulated for nearly a
   century. However, testing this premise among wild animals is constrained
   by difficulties in measuring energy expenditure while simultaneously
   monitoring conventional fitness metrics such as survival and
   reproductive output.
   2. We addressed this issue by exploring the functional links between
   field metabolic rate (FMR), body condition, sex, age and reproductive
   performance in a wild population.
   3. We deployed 3D accelerometers on 115 Adelie penguins Pygoscelis
   adeliae during four breeding seasons at one of the largest colonies of
   this species, Cape Crozier, on Ross Island, Antarctica. The demography
   of this population has been studied for the past 18 years. From
   accelerometry recordings, collected for birds of known age and breeding
   history, we determined the vector of the dynamic body acceleration
   (VeDBA) and used it as a proxy for FMR.
   4. This allowed us to demonstrate relationships among FMR, a breeding
   quality index (BQI) and body condition. Notably, we found a significant
   quadratic relationship between mean VeDBA during foraging and BQI for
   experienced breeders, and individuals in better body condition showed
   lower rates of energy expenditure.
   5. We conclude that using FMR as a fitness component complementary to
   more conventional fitness metrics will yield greater understanding of
   evolutionary and conservation physiology.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Pages = {{536-549}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The inherently multidimensional nature of the niche has not yet been
   integrated into the investigation of individual niche specialization
   within populations. We propose a framework for modeling the between- and
   within-individual components of the population niche as a set of
   variance-covariance matrices, which can be visualized with ellipses or
   ellipsoids. These niche components can be inferred using multiple
   response mixed models, and can incorporate diverse types of data,
   including diet composition, stable isotopes, spatial location, and other
   continuous measures of niche dimensions. We outline how considering both
   individual and population niches in multiple dimensions may enhance our
   understanding of key concepts in ecology and evolution. Considering
   multiple dimensions as well as the within-individual component of
   variation can lead to more meaningful measures of niche overlap between
   species. The impact of a population on its food web or ecosystem can
   depend on the degree of individual variation (via Jensen's inequality),
   and we suggest how the dimensionality of individual specialization could
   amplify this effect. Finally, we draw from concepts in quantitative
   genetics and the study of animal personalities to propose new hypotheses
   about the ecological and evolutionary basis of niche shifts in multiple
   dimensions. We illustrate key ideas using empirical data from sea
   otters, wetland frogs, and threespine stickleback, and discuss
   outstanding questions about the consequences of multidimensional niche
   variation. Setting variation among individuals in an explicitly
   multivariate framework has the potential to transform our understanding
   of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes.}},

Title = {{Consistent individual variation across interaction networks indicates
   social personalities in lemurs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{217-226}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Group members interact with each other during multiple social behaviours
   that range from aggressive to affiliative interactions. It is not known,
   however, whether an individual's suite of social behaviours consistently
   covaries through time and across different types of social interactions.
   Consistent social behaviour would be advantageous in groups, especially
   when individuals need to remember their group members' social roles and
   preferences in order to keep track of social relationships and predict
   conspecifics' future behaviour. Here, we address whether social
   behaviour of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, is consistent through time
   and across four interaction networks (aggression, grooming, contact
   calling, scent marking). We quantified variation in social behaviour
   through four network centrality measures including outdegree,
   outstrength, betweenness and eigenvector centrality. Comparing lemurs'
   measures across 2 years revealed that network centrality remained
   consistent between years. Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent
   across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one
   interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even
   when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus,
   regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and
   frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and
   responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had
   preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years
   and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently
   responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics
   they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that
   individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific,
   but instead persists through time and across multiple social
   interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social
   personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles,
   including how socially active they are and with whom they interact. (C)

   of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) by using a large sample of
   semi-captive timber elephants in Myanmar. Data were collected during
   2014-2017 using questionnaires, for which elephant riders (mahouts)
   rated 28 behavioural adjectives of elephants. Repeated questionnaires
   were obtained for each elephant from several raters whenever possible,
   resulting in 690 ratings of 150 female and 107 male elephants. We
   started by performing a confirmatory factor analysis to compare the fit
   of our data to a previously published captive elephant personality
   structure. Owing to a poor fit of this model to our data, we proceeded
   by performing explanatory factor analysis to determine the personality
   structure in our study population. This model suggested that personality
   in these elephants was manifested as three factors that we labelled as
   Attentiveness, Sociability and Aggressiveness. This structure did not
   differ between the sexes. These results provide the basis for future
   research on the link between personality and reproductive success in
   this endangered species and more generally, help to resolve the
   selective pressures on personalities in long-lived, highly social
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between an individual's cognitive abilities and other
   behavioural attributes is complex, yet critical to understanding how
   individual differences in cognition arise. Here we use western
   mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, to investigate the relationship between
   individual associative learning performance in numerical discrimination
   tests and independent measures of activity, exploration, anxiety and
   sociability. We found extensive and highly repeatable inter-individual
   variation in learning performance (r = 0.89; ICC = 0.89). Males and
   females exhibited similar learning performance, yet differed in
   sociability, activity and their relationship between learning and
   anxiety/exploration tendencies. Sex-specific multivariate behaviour
   scores successfully predicted variation in individual learning
   performance, whereas combined sex analyses did not. Female multivariate
   behaviour scores significantly predict learning performance across
   females (rho = 0.80, p = 0.005) with high-performing female learners
   differentiated from female non-learners and low-performing learners by
   significant contributions of activity and sociability measures.
   Meanwhile, males of different learning performance levels (high-, low-
   and non-learners) were distinguished from each other by unique
   behavioural loadings of sociability, activity and anxiety/exploration
   scores, respectively. Our data suggest that despite convergence on
   learning performance, the sexes diverge in cognitive-behavioural
   relationships that are likely products of different sexual selection
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolism, behaviour and growth are highly flexible in fish species,
   and inter-individual variation in these traits is evolutionarily and
   ecologically significant. It has long been suggested that these traits
   co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study,
   we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential
   relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid
   carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard
   metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e.
   activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and
   after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a
   day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group
   showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed
   fish showed higher SMRs than once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing.
   Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher
   feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar
   specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits was
   affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and
   exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the
   group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in
   the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality
   traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with
   FE and/or SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the
   twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that
   food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and
   ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between
   metabolism and growth.}},

Journal = {{REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present work proposes an evolutionary model of externalizing
   personality that defines variation in this broad psychobiological
   phenotype resulting from genetic influences and a conditional adaptation
   to high-risk environments with high extrinsic morbidity-mortality. Due
   to shared selection pressure, externalizing personality is coadapted to
   fast life history strategies and maximizes inclusive fitness under
   adverse environmental conditions by governing the major trade-offs
   between reproductive versus somatic functions, current versus future
   reproduction, and mating versus parenting efforts. According to this
   model, externalizing personality is a regulatory device at the interface
   between the individual and its environment that is mediated by 2
   overlapping psychobiological systems, that is, the attachment and the
   stress-response system. The attachment system coordinates interpersonal
   behavior and intimacy in close relationships and the stress-response
   system regulates the responsivity to environmental challenge and both
   physiological and behavioral reactions to stress. These proximate
   mechanisms allow for the integration of neuroendocrinological processes
   underlying interindividual differences in externalizing personality.
   Hereinafter I further discuss the model's major implications for
   personality psychology, psychiatry, and public health policy.}},

Title = {{Pesticide-induced changes in personality depend on the urbanization
   level}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Globally increasing urbanization causes major anthropogenic changes in
   ecosystems, drastically altering phenotypes of organisms. Increased
   contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on
   behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality,
   consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been
   investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in
   personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter
   community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a
   sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two
   personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects
   between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the
   damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three
   distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of
   behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural
   correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide
   treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation
   (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability.
   Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on
   urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide
   exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a
   behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae
   appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness
   syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These
   differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained
   by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of
   urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban
   habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring
   behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant
   effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may
   play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of
   animal personalities in natural populations. (C) 2017 The Association

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Individual animals vary in their behaviour and reactions to novel
   situations. These differences may extend to differences in cognition
   among individuals. We tested twenty-six horses for their ability to
   detour around symmetric and asymmetric obstacles. All of the animals
   were able to get around the barrier to reach a food target, but varied
   in their approach. Some horses moved slowly but were more accurate in
   choosing the shortest way. Other horses acted quickly, consistently
   detoured in the same direction, and did not reliably choose the shortest
   way. The remaining horses shifted from a faster, directionally
   consistent response with the symmetric barrier, to a slower but more
   accurate response with the asymmetric barrier. The asymmetric barrier
   induced a reduction in heart rate variability, suggesting that this is a
   more demanding task. The different approaches used to solve the
   asymmetric task may reflect distinct cognitive styles in horses, which
   vary among individuals, and could be linked to different personality
   traits. Understanding equine behaviour and cognition can inform horse
   welfare and management.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersers are often not a random draw from a population, dispersal
   propensity being conditional on individual phenotypic traits and local
   contexts. This non-randomness consequently results in phenotypic
   differences between dispersers and non-dispersers and, in the context of
   biological invasions, in an invasion front made of individuals with a
   biased phenotype. This bias of phenotypes at the front may subsequently
   modulate the strength of ecological effects of an invasive species on
   invaded communities.
   We recently demonstrated that more asocial mosquitofish (Gambusia
   affinis), one of the 100 worst invasive species, disperse further,
   suggesting a sociability-biased invasion front. As behavioural types are
   related to the strength of interspecific interactions, an invasion by a
   biased subset of individuals should have important ecological
   implications for native communities.
   Here, we tested the impact of phenotypic biases in dispersing
   individuals (relative to non-dispersers) on prey communities in
   experimental mesocosms.
   We show that dispersers reduce prey abundance more than do
   non-dispersers during the first 4 weeks after introduction, and that the
   disperser's social types are likely drivers of these differences. These
   differences in prey communities disappeared after 8 weeks suggesting
   prey community resilience against predation in these mesocosm
   ecosystems.
   Consequently, we call for the integration of non-random dispersal,
   dispersal syndromes and more generally intraspecific variation into
   studies predicting the impacts of invasions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to respond flexibly to environmental challenges, for
   instance by learning or by responding appropriately to novel stimuli,
   may be crucial for survival and reproductive success. Experiences made
   during early ontogeny can shape the degree of behavioural flexibility
   maintained by individuals during later life. In natural habitats,
   animals are exposed to a multitude of social and non-social ecological
   factors during early ontogeny, but their relative influences on future
   learning ability and behavioural flexibility are only poorly understood.
   In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we
   investigated whether early social and predator experiences shape the
   learning performance, flexibility, and response to novelty of adults.
   Fish were reared either with or without parents and helpers and with or
   without perceived predation risk in a full-factorial experiment. We
   investigated the influence of these treatments on learning performance
   and flexibility in a spatial acquisition and reversal learning task. To
   test for response to novelty, we performed a neophobia test. We found
   that fish reared with predator experience, but without the presence of
   older group members outperformed fish with other rearing backgrounds in
   reversal learning and that individuals, which had been reared in a
   socially more complex environment together with older group members
   responded less neophobic toward a novel object than individuals reared
   among siblings only. Comparative evidence from fish and rats suggests
   that these developmental effects may be driven by the cues of safety
   perceived in the presence of guarding parents.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitism is a consequence of complex interactions between host,
   parasite, and their shared environment, and host behavior can influence
   parasite risk. Animal personality (i.e., consistent behavioral
   differences that are repeatable across time and context) can influence
   parasitism with more explorative individuals typically hosting greater
   parasite loads. Host sociality is known to impact parasite risk with
   more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or
   transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We
   quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including
   repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these
   personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We
   measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified
   ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2years at a site in
   southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration
   were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least
   chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality. More
   exploratory individuals hosted a greater abundance of ectoparasites
   compared to less exploratory individuals. Our results are consistent
   with past studies implicating personality as a factor in host-parasite
   dynamics and suggest that exploration may be an important behavioral
   correlate of parasite acquisition.}},

   variety in dairy heifers}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{8-14}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Motivation to explore is believed to be widespread among animals, but
   exploratory behaviour varies within populations. Offering variety in
   feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to
   express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals' exploration of
   different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a
   balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested
   the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed
   vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying
   types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also
   investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by
   measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in
   preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was
   evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and
   novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the
   constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at
   varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0
   to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour
   trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake
   of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied
   flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel
   object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and
   exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits.
   These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule
   as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of
   enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects: a key component of the genetic architecture of
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic
   behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory
   predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while
   depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis
   may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires
   tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects
   (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish
   the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We
   tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of
   Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both
   exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that
   genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased
   aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the
   variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying
   that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary
   stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a
   non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in
   opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an
   important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of
   traits under selection.}},

Title = {{Personality assessment and model comparison with behavioral data: A

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Interest in quantifying consistent among-individual variation in primate
   behavior, also known as personality, has grown rapidly in recent
   decades. Although behavioral coding is the most frequently utilized
   method for assessing primate personality, limitations in current
   statistical practice prevent researchers' from utilizing the full
   potential of their coding datasets. These limitations include the use of
   extensive data aggregation, not modeling biologically relevant sources
   of individual variance during repeatability estimation, not partitioning
   between-individual (co)variance prior to modeling personality structure,
   the misuse of principal component analysis, and an over-reliance upon
   exploratory statistical techniques to compare personality models across
   populations, species, and data collection methods. In this paper, we
   propose a statistical framework for primate personality research
   designed to address these limitations. Our framework synthesizes
   recently developed mixed-effects modeling approaches for quantifying
   behavioral variation with an information-theoretic model selection
   paradigm for confirmatory personality research. After detailing a
   multi-step analytic procedure for personality assessment and model
   comparison, we employ this framework to evaluate seven models of
   personality structure in zoo-housed bonobos (Pan paniscus). We find that
   differences between sexes, ages, zoos, time of observation, and social
   group composition contributed to significant behavioral variance.
   Independently of these factors, however, personality nonetheless
   accounted for a moderate to high proportion of variance in average
   behavior across observational periods. A personality structure derived
   from past rating research receives the strongest support relative to our
   model set. This model suggests that personality variation across the
   measured behavioral traits is best described by two correlated but
   distinct dimensions reflecting individual differences in affiliation and
   sociability (Agreeableness) as well as activity level, social play, and
   neophilia toward non-threatening stimuli (Openness). These results
   underscore the utility of our framework for quantifying personality in
   primates and facilitating greater integration between the behavioral
   ecological and comparative psychological approaches to personality
   research.}},

   Behavior and Cognition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in the ability to modify previously learned
   behavior is an important dimension of trait correlations referred to as
   coping styles, behavioral syndromes or personality. These trait clusters
   have been shaped by natural selection, and underlying control mechanisms
   are often conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. In teleost fishes,
   behavioral flexibility and coping style have been studied in the high
   (HR) and low-responsive (LR) rainbow trout lines. Generally, proactive
   LR trout show a behavior guided by previously learned routines, while HR
   trout show a more flexible behavior relying on environmental cues. In
   mammals, routine dependent vs. flexible behavior has been connected to
   variation in limbic dopamine (DA) signaling. Here, we studied the link
   between limbic DA signaling and individual variation in flexibility in
   teleost fishes by a reversal learning approach. HR/LR trout were
   challenged by blocking a learned escape route, previously available
   during interaction with a large and aggressive conspecific. LR trout
   performed a higher number of failed escape attempts against the
   transparent blockage, while HR trout were more able to inhibit the now
   futile escape impulse. Regionally discrete changes in DA neurochemistry
   were observed in micro dissected limbic areas of the telencephalon. Most
   notably, DA utilization in the dorsomedial telencephalon (DM, a
   suggested amygdala equivalent) remained stable in HR trout in response
   to reversal learning under acute stress, while increasing from an
   initially lower level in LR trout. In summary, these results support the
   view that limbic homologs control individual differences in behavioral
   flexibility even in non-mammalian vertebrates.}},

Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Evidence for the transmission of non-genetic information
   from father to offspring is rapidly accumulating. While the impact of
   chemical and physical factors such as toxins or diet on the fitness of
   the parents and their offspring have been studied extensively, the
   importance of behavioural and social circumstances has only recently
   been recognised. Behavioural traits such as personality characteristics
   can be relatively stable, and partly comprise a genetic component but we
   know little about the non-genetic transmission of plastic behavioural
   traits from parents to offspring. We investigated the relative effect of
   personality and of social dominance as indicators at the opposite ends
   of the plasticity range on offspring behaviour in the zebrafish (Danio
   rerio). We assessed male boldness, a behavioural trait that has
   previously been shown previously to possess genetic underpinnings, and
   experimentally manipulated male social status to assess the association
   between the two types of behaviour and their correlation with offspring
   activity.
   Results: We found a clear interaction between the relatively stable and
   putative genetic effects based on inherited differences in personality
   and the experimentally induced epigenetic effects from changes in the
   social status of the father on offspring activity.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that offspring behaviour is determined by a
   combination of paternal personality traits and on-genetic effects
   derived from the social status of the father.}},

Title = {{Male great tits assort by personality during the breeding season}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities can influence social interactions among
   individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes
   and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the
   social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely
   focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here
   we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied
   personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great
   tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the
   exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the
   phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive
   breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that
   males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural
   phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities.
   This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest
   neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where
   neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further
   analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local
   environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more
   important than environmental variation in influencing male territory
   choice. This social organization during the breeding season has
   implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual
   selection on personality in wild animal populations. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Development of behavioural profile in the Northern common boa (Boa
   imperator): Repeatable independent traits or personality?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate
   causation and ecological and evolutionary significance in particular,
   but the question of its development was largely overlooked. The
   attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences
   in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency)
   and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by
   development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables
   measured in various tests with different contexts over several
   life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the
   Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and
   some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values
   are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality
   axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the
   other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the
   feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic
   behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar
   personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of
   behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results
   require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures
   resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied
   the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural
   characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress
   response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the
   agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the
   juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and
   the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it
   is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the
   structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour
   is differentially consistent, the structure can change.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying consistent differences in behaviour among individuals is
   vital to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of
   animal personality. To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of
   a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among
   individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are
   available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to
   estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the
   repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows
   for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon,
   enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively
   breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin
   Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different
   life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state
   could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the
   population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4
   behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object
   exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and
   narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer
   variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable
   behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation
   between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in
   other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately
   repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual
   correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object
   exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately
   heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance). This
   study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for
   selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird.}},

Title = {{Early social isolation impairs development, mate choice and grouping
   behaviour of predatory mites}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{15-21}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The social environment early in life is a key determinant of
   developmental, physiological and behavioural trajectories across
   vertebrate and invertebrate animals. One crucial variable is the
   presence/absence of conspecifics. For animals usually reared in groups,
   social isolation after birth or hatching can be a highly stressful
   circumstance, with potentially long-lasting consequences. Here, we
   assessed the effects of social deprivation (isolation) early in life,
   that is, absence of conspecifics, versus social enrichment, that is,
   presence of conspecifics, on developmental time, body size at maturity,
   mating behaviour and groupliving in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite
   Phytoseiulus persimilis. Socially deprived protonymphs developed more
   slowly and were less socially competent in grouping behaviour than
   socially enriched protonymphs. Compromised social competence in grouping
   behaviour was evident in decreased activity, fewer mutual encounters and
   larger interindividual distances, all of which may entail severe fitness
   costs. In female choice/male competition, socially deprived males mated
   earlier than socially enriched males; in male choice/female competition,
   socially deprived females were more likely to mate than socially
   enriched females. In neither mate choice situation did mating duration
   or body size at maturity differ between socially deprived and enriched
   mating opponents. Social isolation-induced shifts in mating behaviour
   may be interpreted as increased attractiveness or competitiveness or,
   more likely, as hastiness and reduced ability to assess mate quality.
   Overall, many of the social isolation-induced behavioural changes in P.
   persimilis are analogous to those observed in other animals such as
   cockroaches, fruit flies, fishes or rodents. We argue that, due to their
   profound and persistent effects, early social deprivation or enrichment
   may be important determinants in shaping animal personalities. (C) 2017

   differences in personality types}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{125-134}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities have been studied extensively in the last decade.
   It is still not entirely understood, however, how different
   personalities evolve and persist. The social niche specialization
   hypothesis suggests that in group-living animals the combination of
   social conflicts and alternative options on how to deal with them are of
   key importance for the development and evolution of animal personality.
   Here we predicted that, following the social niche specialization
   hypothesis, a more social species should have more pronounced
   personality differences. We tested this prediction using four species of
   shrews that differ in ecology and sociability. Three species (Neomys
   fodiens, Sorex araneus and Sorex minutus) are strictly solitary outside
   the breeding season; the fourth species (Neomys anomalus) is
   intraspecifically more tolerant and able to live in groups. These four
   species offer a good model to assess our questions as N. anomalus can,
   in many other respects (e.g. body size, habitat, foraging mode), be
   considered as an `inbetween' species. We tested individuals of all
   species for their solitary activity and their activity and agonistic
   behaviour in within- and between-species dyadic encounters. We found
   that individuals of N. anomalus, but not the other species tested,
   showed consistent behavioural variation in agonistic behaviour.
   Consistent individual differences in activity were, however, also
   present in other species and activity was further correlated between the
   different contexts in all tested species. Finding more pronounced
   personality differences in N. anomalus than in the other, less sociable

Abstract = {{In a fluctuating environment, the optimal level of exploratory behavior
   depends on the proportion of current risks and benefits. The exploratory
   behavior is, therefore, often subjected to heterogenous selection. In
   populations of commensal rodents living in close proximity of humans,
   this pressure is further increased by pest management. We hypothesize
   that the black rat (Rattus rattus) responds to this pressure by either
   high behavioral flexibility or by development of personality types. The
   aim of this study was to analyze exploratory behavior and boldness of
   wild black rats and its changes over time to determine whether
   exploratory behavior is a personality trait in black rats. Studies on
   animals with unreduced variability are necessary for determination of
   normal range of behaviors. The behavior in the open field and hole board
   tests yielded 1 multivariate variable representing exploratory behavior
   and 1 representing boldness. The hole board test additionally provided
   an axis representing exploratory behavior. Exploratory behavior showed
   moderate to high repeatability, even though we observed a considerable
   effect of habituation. Exploratory behavior was also strongly correlated
   across contexts; therefore, our results suggest that the black rat
   responds to heterogenous selection pressure by developing personality
   types. We also found a strong effect of litter identity on some aspects
   of the exploratory behavior. Boldness was less repeatable, which we
   interpret as high behavioral flexibility in this behavioral trait. In
   concordance with our hypothesis, the personality types in exploratory
   behavior, but not in boldness, are possibly maintained by heterogenous
   selection pressure created by human pest management.}},

Title = {{A behavioural syndrome, but less evidence for a relationship with
   cognitive traits in a spatial orientation context}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Animals show consistent individual behavioural differences
   in many species. Further, behavioural traits (personality traits) form
   behavioural syndromes, characterised by correlations between different
   behaviours. Mechanisms maintaining these correlations could be
   constrained due to underlying relationships with cognitive traits. There
   is growing evidence for the non-independence of animal personality and
   general cognitive abilities in animals, but so far, studies on the
   direction of the relationship between them revealed contradictory
   results. Still, it is hypothesised that individuals may exhibit
   consistent learning and decision styles. Fast behavioural types
   (consistently bolder and more active individuals) are expected to show
   faster learning styles. Slow behavioural types in contrast are assumed
   to learn slower but more accurately. This can be caused by a
   speed-accuracy trade-off that individuals face during decision making.
   We measured the repeatability of three personality and four spatial
   cognitive traits in adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We
   analysed correlations among personality traits (behavioural syndrome).
   We further investigated the relationships between personality and
   spatial cognitive traits as a first step exploring the potential
   connection between personality and cognition in this species.
   Results: Our results showed that exploration, activity and boldness were
   repeatable in adult mice. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was
   also significantly repeatable, as well as spatial learning performance
   and decision speed. We found no repeatability of decision accuracy.
   Harvest mice showed a behavioural syndrome as we observed strong
   positive correlations between personality traits. The speed-accuracy
   trade-off was not apparent within, nor between individuals.
   Nevertheless, we found weak evidence for a relationship between
   personality and spatial cognitive traits as fast behavioural types
   learned a spatial orientation task faster than slow types, and shyer
   harvest mice made decisions quicker than bolder mice.
   Conclusions: Given these correlations, our data provided some first
   insights into the relationship between personality and spatial cognitive
   traits in harvest mice and will hopefully stimulate more studies in this
   field.}},

Title = {{Stress response to handling is short lived but may reflect personalities
   in a wild, Critically Endangered tortoise species}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the acute stress response associated with animal
   personalities by measuring plasma glucocorticoids throughout handling
   and collected similar to 2 years of movement and behavioural data in a
   wild, Critically Endangered animal, Astrochelys radiata (radiated
   tortoise). To determine whether our standard, brief conscientious
   handling procedures induce a stress response in our target species, we
   applied a stressor by way of initial animal processing and deployment of
   telemetry equipment. During surveys and processing, we sampled animals
   immediately upon detection, again after completing transmitter
   attachment and processing, and a final time the following day. We then
   used radiotelemetry to follow a subset of the animals for 22 months
   while collecting behavioural, climatic and location data. We found that
   brief and conscientious handling did not illicit consistent changes in
   plasma concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) but
   did reveal tremendous individual variation in response. The CORT
   concentration ranged more than 200-fold after imposing the stressor and
   returned to near-baseline values by the following day. When we accounted
   for the wide variation by calculating the degree of each individual's
   stress response relative to its baseline over its processing time, we
   discovered two non-overlapping physiological response types; those in
   which CORT concentrations increased dramatically in response to handling
   (219 +/- 89.8 pg/ml/min) and those in which CORT varied only slightly
   (5.3 +/- 8.9 pg/ml/min). The response types (strong vs. mild) also
   predicted body condition, home range size, activity, and behavioural
   tendencies. The degree of the individual's stress response in this
   species may be one component of correlated physiological and behavioural
   traits (animal personalities), which have previously been obscured in
   other chelonian studies by the use of mean values and should be
   considered in future conservation management applications for chelonian
   species.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The presence of variation in behavior on the betweenindividual level is
   considered the hallmark of personality. In contrast, behavioral
   syndromes are commonly recognized when documented on the phenotypic
   level, which is a mix of between- individual and residual
   (within-individual) correlations. Phenotypic and between- individual
   correlations need not align, and investigations on different levels of
   the same syndrome may hence lead to opposite inferences.
   Between-individual correlations, arguably, provide stronger evidence for
   an intrinsically determined behavioral syndrome than phenotypic
   correlations. We compiled 109 literature estimates of between-
   individual and phenotypic correlations between behaviors from 30
   studies, performed on 22 species covering a wide range of taxa. Contrary
   to our expectation, the phenotypic correlation in behaviors was, on
   average, a reasonable predictor of the between- individual correlation
   in terms of magnitude and sign. Although our finding does not warrant
   the use of the phenotypic correlation as a suitable approximation of the
   between- individual correlation for any particular study, it does
   suggest that the phenotypic correlations used to infer the majority of
   behavioral syndromes to date have provided a reasonable characterization
   of syndrome associative strength.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent and correlated inter-individual differences in behaviours,
   the so-called `personalities', have been identified in many vertebrates.
   The ability to respond to stressful events is part of personalities and
   can have important fitness consequences, as it determines how
   individuals cope with environmental challenges. As a consequence of
   pleiotropic effects of genes involved in several functions,
   inter-individual differences in behavioural responses can be associated
   with phenotypic traits, like melanin-based plumage colouration in birds.
   We examined the association between three proxies of the behavioural
   stress response and breast plumage colouration in barn swallow (Hirundo
   rustica) nestlings. We found that nestling behavioural responses were
   consistent within individuals and similar among siblings, thus
   suggesting that these behaviours may contribute to define individual
   `personalities'. However, nestling behavioural stress response was not
   significantly predicted by variation in breast plumage colouration,
   indicating that in juveniles of this species melanin-based colouration
   does not convey to conspecifics reliable information on individual
   ability to cope with stressful events.}},

Abstract = {{Burmese pythons are established in the Everglades and are expanding
   their population in Florida to more urbanized and fragmented habitats.
   Understanding movement and dispersal behavior contributes to our
   knowledge of how landscape factors influence the persistence of pythons
   in Florida's habitat. Our goal was to examine personality-dependent
   dispersal in juvenile Burmese pythons by creating behavioral scenarios
   of risk-taking behavior on a shy-bold continuum using an
   individual-based model. We observed that a behaviorally plastic strategy
   best resembled empirically derived patterns of the Burmese python's
   expansion from the Everglades into the increasingly urbanized landscapes
   of Homestead and Miami, Florida. This result is consistent with the
   notion that animal personalities can be flexible in different situations
   and that animals must make decisions based on trade-offs while
   dispersing. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

   field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions,
   and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here
   we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally
   compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and
   the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a
   design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of
   sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the
   field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We
   analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including
   repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components.
   Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory
   and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across
   situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods
   of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this
   effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to
   laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was
   stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those
   that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that
   although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results
   like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of
   consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction
   between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals
   are observed. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{A Time to Wean? Impact of Weaning Age on Anxiety-Like Behaviour and
   Stability of Behavioural Traits in Full Adulthood}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In mammals, weaning constitutes an important phase in the progression to
   adulthood. It comprises the termination of suckling and is characterized
   by several changes in the behaviour of both mother and offspring.
   Furthermore, numerous studies in rodents have shown that the time point
   of weaning shapes the behavioural profile of the young. Most of these
   studies, however, have focused on `early weaning', while relatively
   little work has been done to study `late weaning' effects. The aim of
   the present study was therefore to explore behavioural effects of `late
   weaning', and furthermore to gain insights into modulating effects of
   weaning age on the consistency of behavioural expressions over time. In
   total, 25 male and 20 female C57BL/6J mice, weaned after three (W3) or
   four (W4) weeks of age, were subjected to a series of behavioural
   paradigms widely used to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploratory
   locomotion, and nest building performance. Behavioural testing took
   place with the mice reaching an age of 20 weeks and was repeated eight
   weeks later to investigate the stability of behavioural expressions over
   time. At the group level, W4 mice behaved less anxious and more
   explorative than W3 animals in the Open Field and Novel Cage, while
   anxiety-like behaviour on the Elevated Plus Maze was modulated by a
   weaning-age-by-sex interaction. Furthermore, weaning age shaped the
   degree of behavioural stability over time in a sex-specific way. While
   W3 females and W4 males displayed a remarkable degree of behavioural
   stability over time, no such patterns were observed in W3 males and W4
   females. Adding to the existing literature, we could thus confirm that
   effects of weaning age do indeed exist when prolonging this phase, and
   were furthermore able to provide first evidence for the impact of
   weaning age and sex on the consistency of behavioural expressions over
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to characterize stress coping styles of
   Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles and breeders and to
   select an operational behavioural screening test (OBST) that can be used
   by the aquaculture industry to classify and select between behavioural
   phenotypes in order to improve production indicators. A total of 61
   juveniles and 59 breeders were subjected to five individual behavioural
   tests and two grouping tests. At the end of the individual tests, all
   animals were blood sampled in order to measure cortisol, glucose and
   lactate. Three tests (restraining, new environment and confinement)
   characterized the stress coping style behaviour of Senegalese sole
   juveniles and breeders and demonstrated inter-individual consistency.
   Further, the tests when incorporated into a principal components
   analysis (PCA) (i) identified two principal axes of personality traits:
   `fearfulness-reactivity' and `activity-exploration', (ii) were
   representative of the physiological axis of stress coping style, and
   (iii) were validated by established group tests. This study proposed for
   the first time three individual coping style tests that reliably
   represented proactive and reactive personalities of Senegalese sole
   juveniles and breeders. In addition, the three proposed tests met some
   basic operational criteria (rapid testing, no special equipment and easy
   to apply and interpret) that could prove attractive for fish farmers to
   identify fish with a specific behaviour that gives advantages in the
   culture system and that could be used to establish selection-based
   breeding programmes to improve domestication and production.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals may vary consistently in their architectural makeup of the
   constructions they build, which might have tremendous implications for
   their ecology and fitness. In particular, the relationship between
   individual differences in architectural constructions and behavior
   (i.e., animal personalities) is largely unexplored. Individual black
   widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, build a 3D cobweb made up of
   distinctive components serving to support foraging (gumfooted lines) or
   antipredator protection (structural lines). To explore the relationship
   between individual differences in behavior and architectural
   constructions, we quantified 1) the level of consistent individual
   variation in several elements of web structure and 2) the level of
   consistent individual variation in foraging behavior and its
   relationship with web structure. We controlled for condition-dependent
   or environmental effects by satiating all spiders prior to assays and
   maintaining them in standardized conditions. Spiders exhibited
   consistent differences in the number of gumfooted lines they built for
   capturing preys and overall web weight, but not in the number of
   structural lines. Individuals also varied consistently in their tendency
   to attack a prey cue, despite all spiders being satiated. Finally,
   spiders producing more gumfooted lines exhibited a higher tendency to
   attack the prey cue. Our results suggest that the architectural
   constructions may impact the expression of individual behavioral
   differences (or animal personalities) and suggest that individual
   behavior and extended phenotype may be part of alternative foraging
   strategies in L. hesperus.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1533-1538}},

Abstract = {{Parasites often manipulate the behavior of their hosts to increase their
   transmission success. However, it is not known whether host manipulation
   affects the consistency of host personality traits or correlations
   between these traits. Here, using fish hosts and their eye-lens
   infecting parasite, we show that manipulative effects of parasites on
   host personalities are weak.Among the ecological factors acting on the
   evolution and expression of animal personalities and behavioral
   syndromes, parasitism has received comparatively little attention.
   However, infection and host behavior are often strongly intertwined,
   because host behavior can predict the risk of infection and can also be
   changed by an infection. We conducted a controlled experimental
   infection study to explore the effects of infection on host boldness,
   exploration and activity using rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and its
   trematode parasite Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, which infects a central
   sensory organ of the fish, the eye lens. Contrary to our expectation,
   infection did not change the within-individual consistency of the
   personality traits or the relationships between the traits, but infected
   individuals were less bold than uninfected control individuals. We also
   found no relationship between personality in uninfected fish and
   resistance against parasite infection, suggesting that behaviors which
   increase parasite encounter do not select for improved resistance. Thus,
   we found only weak support for parasite-mediated effects on animal
   personalities.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural phenotypes may provide a means for identifying individuals
   that disproportionally contribute to disease spread and epizootic
   outbreaks. For example, bolder phenotypes may experience greater
   exposure and susceptibility to pathogenic infection because of distinct
   interactions with conspecifics and their environment. We tested the
   value of behavioural phenotypes in larval amphibians for predicting
   ranavirus transmission in experimental trials. We found that behavioural
   phenotypes characterized by latency-to-food and swimming profiles were
   predictive of disease susceptibility and infectiousness defined as the
   capacity of an infected host to transmit an infection by contacts. While
   viral shedding rates were positively associated with transmission, we
   also found an inverse relationship between contacts and infections.
   Together these results suggest intrinsic traits that influence behaviour
   and the quantity of pathogens shed during conspecific interactions may
   be an important contributor to ranavirus transmission. These results
   suggest that behavioural phenotypes provide a means to identify
   individuals more likely to spread disease and thus give insights into
   disease outbreaks that threaten wildlife and humans.}},

Abstract = {{Bird populations exposed to different extrinsic conditions often differ
   in the responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
   and thus in corticosterone response that individuals mount when facing
   stressful events. However, the contribution of genetic variation to
   among-individual variability in HPA axis responsiveness across different
   environmental conditions is poorly understood. Melanin-based coloured
   types provide reliable phenotypic markers of alternative genotypes
   underlying stress coping styles. Large variations in melanin-based
   colouration are heritable in feral pigeons. We tested whether
   melanin-based colouration is associated with variation in corticosterone
   stress response in feral pigeons. To this end, we examined how
   corticosterone response varies both within and between differently
   coloured individuals across different environmental conditions.
   Differently coloured individuals produced different stress-induced
   corticosterone levels in relation to their environmental conditions:
   dark pigeons exhibited a higher corticosterone when originating from
   rural habitats, while this was not observed in pale pigeons. This
   suggests that among-population variation in stress response is higher in
   dark pigeons, this variation possibly reflecting adjustment and/or
   (epi)genetic adaptation to environmental conditions. In addition,
   corticosterone response increased with the degree of melanin-based
   colouration in pigeons originating from rural habitats but not in
   pigeons originating from more urbanized populations, resulting in the
   coexistence of alternative stress responses in some populations, but not
   in others. Our results suggest that species with melanin-based variation
   in differently urbanized populations along rural-urban gradients are
   potentially good candidate systems for studying stress coping styles
   under alternative selective regimes.}},

Title = {{Are personality traits consistent in fish?-The influence of social

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural and physiological responses to
   challenges are progressively accepted as adaptive variation and reveal a
   strong degree of evolutionary conservation throughout the vertebrate
   taxa. Previous studies in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) suggested
   that individual differences in behaviour reflect distinct coping styles
   or personality, contrasting consistent traits associations. One of the
   traits that have been shown to be consistent over time and across
   context is the escape response under a restraining test. Using this
   trait as a proxy of personality in seabream the influence of social
   context in the consistency of escape behaviour was investigated.
   Individually tagged juvenile seabream (n = 360; 70.18 +/- 11.44 g; mean
   +/- SD) were subjected to a restraining test that consisted of keeping
   each fish in an emerged net for one minute. Behaviours measured in the
   net (latency to escape; number of escape attempts and total time spent
   on escaping) were collapsed into first principal component scores using
   Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Using the PCA scores the
   individuals were distributed into homogeneous groups (n = 30 each group)
   of proactive, reactive and intermediate. Control groups consisted of
   mixed groups with 1/3 of each coping style. After one month the same
   individuals were exposed to the same test (restraining test) to assess
   consistency of behavioural responses. Results indicate that homogenous
   groups of proactive (p = 0.086) and reactive (p = 0.159) individuals did
   not exhibit consistent behavioural responses as opposed to the
   intermediate (p = 0.028) and control groups (p < 0.001). This study thus
   confirms that the social context in which fish are kept significantly
   influence personality traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the presence of predators, many prey species exhibit immediate
   behavioral responses like the avoidance of risky areas, which imposes
   opportunity costs, for instance, in the form of reduced foraging. Thus,
   prey species should be able to discriminate between different predator
   types and adjust their response to the imminent predation risk. In our
   current study, we evaluated the relative importance of innate versus
   learned components of predator recognition and avoidance in the guppy
   (Poecilia reticulata). We used a feral guppy population occurring in
   Germany and compared avoidance reactions of each focal individual
   towards both coevolved piscine predators from their original
   distribution range and novel, presently co-occurring predator species.
   Wild-caught, predator-experienced as well as laboratory-reared,
   predator-na < ve individuals showed strong avoidance responses towards
   all predator animations. Avoidance was stronger in small-bodied than in
   large-bodied individuals in both cohorts; however, this effect was
   significant only in predator-na < ve fish. Moreover, wild-caught
   individuals showed a significantly higher within-individual variance
   (across the six predator species) along with a lower among-individual
   variance in predator avoidance, which resulted in a lower behavioral
   repeatability in this cohort. Our results suggest that consistent
   individual differences in risk-taking behavior (also referred to as the
   personality trait `boldness') are modified by predator exposure and
   learning about predators.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial location within aggregations (i.e., periphery, central) is of
   biological significance to gregarious animals. Because these positions
   are a potential consequence of consistent individual behavioral
   differences, or personality, a better understanding of potential
   mechanisms concerning personality is central to predicting an
   individuals' location. To determine the effects of individual
   personality on the dynamic spatial positioning of Uca pugilator while
   herding, field data collection and agent-based modeling were employed.
   Individuals were assayed to establish their personalities and returned
   to the field for observation as a means of identifying location
   preference within selfish herds. There was a significant difference
   between the extreme personalities and the proportion of time spent on
   the edge of the herd. The active individuals were at the periphery
   similar to 50 \% more of the time than less active individuals. An
   individual-based model qualitatively replicated these field results by
   applying the mechanism of activity level as an indicator of individual
   personality. This suggests that differences in personality-dependent
   movement are sufficient to explain the spatial positioning of
   individuals within selfish herds. This study enhances our understanding
   of the possible mechanisms that govern group movement, and has
   implications for modeling population dynamics that can be influenced by
   individual personality.
   Animal personality influences the level of exploratory activity of
   individual animals, with some individuals being consistently more active
   and others consistently less active, and may therefore be used to
   mechanistically predict the location of individual animals within groups
   or herds. Here, we investigate the relationship between individual
   personality and location on the edge vs. in the center of foraging herds
   of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator. We combine observational testing
   of activity level in lab, observations of spatial positioning within
   herds in the field, and agent-based computer simulation modeling to
   demonstrate that differences in exploratory movement can sufficiently
   explain the spatial positioning of individuals within herds. Thus, the
   spatial positioning of individual animals within herds can be explained
   without relying on choices by individual animals.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},
Pages = {{1777-1793}},
Abstract = {{The field of animal personality has received considerable attention in
   past decades, yet few studies have examined personality in the wild.
   This study investigated docility, a measure of boldness, in two Port
   Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) populations using field
   tests, and if laterality differences explained docility levels. We
   developed a struggle test as an assay for docility, which is
   particularly amenable to field studies. The struggle test was effective,
   and repeatable inter-individual docility differences were observed. Sex,
   but not population, influenced docility scores, with male sharks being
   less docile than females. This difference is likely due to the
   contrasting role each sex plays during mating. We also found
   individualized lateralization. However, no individual-level relationship
   between lateralization and docility was detected. Despite reported links
   between laterality and some personality traits, the relationship between
   laterality and boldness remains inconclusive in sharks. Further studies
   will prove essential to clarify the mechanisms behind personality traits
   in vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes, that is correlated behaviours, may be a result
   from adaptive correlational selection, but in a new environmental
   setting, the trait correlation might act as an evolutionary constraint.
   However, knowledge about the quantitative genetic basis of behavioural
   syndromes, and the stability and evolvability of genetic correlations
   under different ecological conditions, is limited. We investigated the
   quantitative genetic basis of correlated behaviours in the freshwater
   isopod Asellus aquaticus. In some Swedish lakes, A.aquaticus has
   recently colonized a novel habitat and diverged into two ecotypes,
   presumably due to habitat-specific selection from predation. Using a
   common garden approach and animal model analyses, we estimated
   quantitative genetic parameters for behavioural traits and compared the
   genetic architecture between the ecotypes. We report that the genetic
   covariance structure of the behavioural traits has been altered in the
   novel ecotype, demonstrating divergence in behavioural correlations.
   Thus, our study confirms that genetic correlations behind behaviours can
   change rapidly in response to novel selective environments.}},

Abstract = {{Social-rearing environment has profound effects on behaviour, physiology
   and development. A complex social environment enhances an individual's
   social skills and competence in many animal taxa. Consequently, complete
   social deprivation seriously impairs various aspects of behaviour,
   development, brain function and hormone levels. Although sexual
   selection is a major evolutionary force, studies investigating the
   effects of social environment on the development of reproductive
   behaviour are scarce. Thus, we aimed to examine how long-term social
   deprivation influenced sexual behaviour in both sexes of Pelvicachromis
   taeniatus, a biparental cichlid fish with mutual mate choice. In
   particular, we focused on intersexual behaviour, i.e. courtship and
   intrasexual aggression of fish reared and maintained either in a group
   or in isolation. We found significant differences between socially
   deprived and group-reared fish. Males and females reared in isolation
   were less likely to perform courtship behaviour and showed less interest
   towards potential mates than group-reared fish. Intrasexual aggression
   of isolated fish was reduced as well in both sexes. Furthermore, in
   males we found positive behavioural correlations between inter-and
   intrasexual behaviour at the individual level independent from the
   social-rearing environment. In females, this correlation was only found
   in group-reared fish, indicating an effect of social environment on
   behavioural correlations. Consequently, our results suggest that
   long-term social isolation seriously impairs social competence of P.
   taeniatus in sexual selection. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Individual variation in how animals react to stress and environmental
   change has become a central topic in a wide range of biological
   disciplines, from evolutionary ecology to biomedicine. Such variation
   manifests phenotypically as correlated trait-clusters (referred to as
   coping styles, behavioral syndromes, shyness-boldness, or personality
   traits). Thresholds for switching from active coping (fight-flight) to
   inhibition and passive behavior when exposed to stress depend on
   experience and genetic factors. Comparative research has revealed a
   range of neuroendocrine-behavioral associations which are conserved
   throughout the vertebrate subphylum, including factors affecting
   perception, learning, and memory of stimuli and events. Here we review
   conserved aspects of the contribution of neurogenesis and other aspects
   of neural plasticity to stress coping. In teleost fish, brain cell
   proliferation and neurogenesis have received recent attention. This work
   reveals that brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis are associated
   with heritable variation in stress coping style, and they are also
   differentially affected by short-and long-term stress in a biphasic
   manner. Routine-dependent and inflexible behavior in proactive
   individuals is associated with limited neural plasticity. These
   evolutionarily conserved relationships hold the potential to illuminate
   the biological background for stress-related neurobiological disorders.

Abstract = {{Organisms can determine the environment they experience through the
   process of niche construction. This may have important evolutionary
   consequences by exposing them to new selection pressures, producing a
   faster response to selection, and building suites of co-adapted traits.
   Traits of the parasite which influence the likelihood of encountering
   different host environments, or which change the host environment, can
   be regarded as niche construction traits, as can traits of the host
   which influence the likelihood of the host being infected by parasites.
   A niche construction perspective may provide new insights into the
   evolution of host/parasite interactions; this is illustrated with
   several examples from the viewpoint of both parasite and host traits.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{238-248}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities (e.g. consistent across-context behavioural
   differences between individuals) can lead to differences in mate choice.
   However, evidence for this link remains limited. Pre-mating sexual
   cannibalism can be a behavioural syndrome (i.e. a suboptimal
   personality) in which adaptive female aggression towards heterospecific
   prey spills over on non-adaptive aggression towards courting males,
   independently of the female mating or feeding status (i.e. the
   aggressive spillover hypothesis', ASH). On the other hand, sexual
   cannibalism can also be a form of mate choice by which females
   selectively kill or mate with males depending on the male phenotype. We
   introduce the hypothesis that the most aggressive females in the
   population will not only attack males more frequently, but will be less
   likely to impose sexual selection on males through sexual cannibalism.
   Assuming that in a field common garden experiment in which females were
   fed ad libitum the rate of weight gain by a female may reflect her
   voracity or aggressiveness, we show that in the cannibalistic burrowing
   wolf spider Lycosa hispanica (formerly L.tarantula), voracity towards
   heterospecific prey predicts a female's tendency towards sexual
   cannibalism. Unmated females with higher weight gains were more
   cannibalistic and attacked males regardless of the male phenotype. On
   the other hand, females that were less voracious tended to be less
   cannibalistic, and when they did kill a male, they were selective,
   killing males in poorer condition and mating with those in better
   condition. Our results demonstrate that females with different
   phenotypes (growth rates) differently imposed selection on male
   condition, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that female aggression
   levels can spill over on sexual selection through sexual cannibalism.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies suggest that individuals with a high resting metabolic

   digestion under hypoxia than they do under normoxia due to their
   relatively high maintenance cost. To test this hypothesis, we measured
   the RMR and postprandial metabolic responses of juvenile southern
   catfish, Silurus meridionalis, under normoxia and moderate hypoxia. The
   results provided the first evidence that (1) both the RMR and
   postprandial metabolic rate showed repeatability across different water
   {[}O-2] conditions and (2) the correlation between the RMR and
   postprandial metabolic traits differs with changes in environmental
   factors (water {[}O-2]). These findings suggested that the digestive

Abstract = {{Despite a rapid increase in animal personality research, critical gaps
   remain. We have little knowledge of the long-term (as opposed to
   short-term) consistency of personality and the relationships between
   personality and behavioural flexibility in wild, free-living animals.
   This study investigates personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual
   differences in behaviour) and contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in
   behaviour between contexts) of these traits in the Nazca booby (Sula
   granti), a long-lived, free-living seabird. We tested birds for
   personality in the field, during incubation, using a human intruder
   test, two novel object tests, and a social stimulus test (mirror), and
   determined repeatability of behavioural traits both within-season
   (short-term) and between several years (long-term). We found high short-
   and long-term repeatability of aggressive and anxiety-related behaviours
   when confronted with a nest intruder and novel objects, but lower
   repeatability during social stimulation. Contextual plasticity was
   highly repeatable across years for aggressive behaviours, and low for
   anxiety-related behaviours. Plasticity did not correlate across
   behaviours into a `meta-personality' trait. Contextual plasticity in
   behavioural traits was highly correlated with the expression of those
   traits, suggesting that individuals are able to both react strongly and
   modify their behaviour depending on context, perhaps due to consistent
   differences in individual quality. Model selection exercises using
   structural equation models evaluated the relationships between
   personality factors, indicating a behavioural syndrome in which anxiety-
   or agitation-related behaviours covary strongly and positively, and both
   covary weakly and negatively with aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to measure consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e.
   animal personality) fall into two categories, subjective ratings and
   behavioral codings. Ratings are seldom used despite being potentially
   more efficient than codings. One potential limitation for the use of
   ratings is that it is assumed that long-term observers or experts in the
   field are required to score individuals. This can be problematic in many
   cases, especially for long-term ecological studies where there is high
   turnover in personnel. We tested whether raters who were unacquainted
   with subjects could produce reliable and valid personality assessments
   of yellow-bellied marmots Marmota flaviventris. Two raters, previously
   unacquainted with individuals and marmot behavior, scored 130 subjects
   on fifteen different adjectives in both open-field (OF) and mirror image
   stimulation (MIS) trials. Eight OF and nine MIS adjectives were reliable
   as indicated by both a high degree of intra-observer and inter-observer
   reliability. Additionally, some ratings were externally valid,
   correlating with behavioral codings. Our data suggest that
   activity/exploration and sociability can be a reliable and valid
   measurement of personality traits in studies where raters were
   unacquainted with subjects. These traits are observable with the
   personality tests we used; otherwise researchers using unacquainted
   raters should be cautious in the tests they employ}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior imply that individuals act
   in the same manner every time they encounter a situation while differing
   from others. While these differences occur in a variety of contexts in a
   wide range of organisms, how recent experience affects behavioral
   consistency remains underexplored. Male Siamese fighting fish exhibit
   consistent individual differences in behavior when both a male and a
   female are present. However, whether these responses can be shaped by
   immediate recent aggressive experience is unknown. In this study, males
   first were presented with paired dummy male and female conspecifics
   after they had been isolated to obtain a baseline, no-experience
   measure. Males then won and lost fights and were retested with the
   dummies after each fight. These three experience types (no, win, loss)
   occurred both when males did and did not have nests to determine the
   effects of nest presence, experience, and the interaction between these
   factors on behavioral consistency. Overall behavior did not change based
   on experience with the exception of male-directed tail beats.
   Repeatability values were affected more by having a nest than fight
   outcome. This study demonstrates that consistent individual differences
   in behavior to conflicting stimuli are fairly resistant to short-term
   aggressive experiential effects.}},

Abstract = {{Individual consistency over time in behavioral responses to challenging
   situations is usually regarded as an indication of the existence of
   animal personality types. Although such consistency has been found in a
   variety of species, information about long-term stability is scanty, in
   particular across different life history stages, for example
   reproductive and non-reproductive periods, which have the potential to
   affect substantially the behavioral responses of animals. In our study
   of adult female laboratory mice, we explored the stability of behavioral
   responses across a 43-day period by successively testing the animals on
   an elevated plus maze. We tested two groups, one group that had
   offspring during the first two tests but not during the last test, and
   another group that only had offspring during the last test. We found
   clear evidence of individual consistency over time by means of positive
   significant correlations across the different tests: animals that spent
   more time in the closed arms and those that entered the open arms more
   often during the first test also tended to do so during the second
   test-when still in the same reproductive state, and also during the
   third test-when in a different reproductive state. In addition, females
   of the two groups did not differ overall in their responses, although we
   found a significant increase in the frequency and duration of presumed
   anxiety-related behavior during the course of the experiment,
   contradicting the notion that habituation effects should attenuate the
   challenge of the test situation. In conclusion, our study strongly
   suggests the existence of stable personality types in female laboratory
   mice, even across different reproductive stages.}},

Abstract = {{Personality research has a long and fruitful history in psychology. In
   the past 15 years, this topic emerged as an important subfield in
   behavioral ecology as well. A large amount of empirical data has been
   gathered, and promising theoretical models have been developed. Despite
   all of this, there is almost no communication between personality
   research in humans and the behavioral ecology of animal personality. The
   aim of this article is to present contemporary research on animal
   personality and thus, to facilitate its integration into human
   personality psychology. We describe three major topics in the behavioral
   ecology of personality: the attempts to explain (a) individual
   differences in personality, (b) temporal stability of personality
   traits, and (c) the emergence and stability of behavioral syndromes
   (correlations between personality traits). In all three topics, we
   suggest how behavioral ecological research and its conceptual apparatus
   could be implemented in human personality psychology. We also highlight
   the importance of the empirical measuring of fitness indicators and the
   adequate translation of concepts from behavioral ecology to human
   personality psychology and vice versa. Our analysis shows that
   behavioral ecology represents a fruitful explanatory and empirical
   framework with high heuristic potential in explaining key problems of
   personality. The majority of hypotheses developed in this discipline can
   be tested in human personality psychology; however, some of them demand
   complex research designs.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency within and across behaviours (animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome, respectively) has been vigorously studied in
   the last decade, leading to the emergence of animal personality
   research. It has been proposed recently that not only mean behaviour
   (behavioural type), but the environmentally induced behavioural change
   (behavioural plasticity) might also differ between individuals within
   populations. While case studies presenting between-individual variation
   in behavioural plasticity have started to accumulate, the mechanisms
   behind its emergence are virtually unknown. We have recently
   demonstrated that ecologically relevant environmental stimuli during
   ontogeny are necessary for the development of animal personality and
   behavioural syndromes. However, it is unknown whether between-individual
   variation in behavioural plasticity is hard-wired or induced. Here, we
   tested whether experience with predation during development affected
   predator-induced behavioural plasticity in Rana dalmatina tadpoles. We
   ran a common garden experiment with two ontogenetic predation
   treatments: tadpoles developed from hatching in either the presence or
   absence of olfactory predator stimuli. Then, we assayed all tadpoles
   repeatedly for activity and risk-taking both in the absence and presence
   of olfactory predator stimuli. We found that (a) between-individual
   variation in predator-induced behavioural plasticity was present only in
   the group that developed in the presence of olfactory stimuli from
   predators and (b) previous experience with predatory stimuli resulted in
   lower plastic response at the group level. The latter pattern resulted
   from increased between-individual variation and not from universally
   lower individual responses. We also found that experience with predation
   during development increased the predictability (i.e. decreased the
   within-individual variation unrelated to environmental change) of
   activity, but not risk-taking. In line with this, tadpoles developing
   under perceived predatory risk expressed their activity with higher
   repeatability. We suggest that ecologically relevant environmental
   stimuli are not only fundamental for the development of animal
   personality and behavioural syndromes, but also for individual variation
   in behavioural plasticity. Thus, experience is of central importance for
   the emergence of individual behavioural variation at many levels.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral ecologists have hypothesized that among-individual
   differences in resting metabolic rate (RMR) may predict consistent
   individual differences in mean values for costly behaviors or for
   behaviors that affect energy intake rate. This hypothesis has empirical
   support and presently attracts considerable attention, but, notably, it
   does not provide predictions for individual differences in (a)
   behavioral plasticity or (b) unexplained variation (residual variation
   from mean individual behavior, here termed predictability). We outline
   how consideration of aerobic maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and
   particularly aerobic scope (= MMR - RMR) can be used to simultaneously
   make predictions about mean and among- and within-individual variation
   in behavior. We predict that while RMR should be proportional to an
   individual's mean level of sustained behavioral activity (one aspect of
   its personality), individuals with greater aerobic scope will also have
   greater scope to express behavioral plasticity and/or greater
   unpredictability in behavior (= greater residual variation). As a first
   step toward testing these predictions, we analyze existing activity data
   from selectively bred lines of mice that differ in both daily activity
   and aerobic scope. We find that replicate high-scope mice are more
   active on average and show greater among-individual variation in
   activity, greater among-individual variation in plasticity, and greater
   unpredictability. These data provide some tentative first support for
   our hypothesis, suggesting that further research on this topic would be
   valuable.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of individual differences in animal behavior
   and stress physiology are increasingly studied in wild animals, yet the
   possibility that stress physiology underlies individual variation in
   social behavior has received less attention. In this review, we bring
   together these study areas and focus on understanding how the activity
   of the vertebrate neuroendocrine stress axis (HPA-axis) may underlie
   individual differences in social behavior in wild animals. We first
   describe a continuum of vertebrate social behaviors spanning from
   initial social tendencies (proactive behavior) to social behavior
   occurring in reproductive contexts (parental care, sexual pair-bonding)
   and lastly to social behavior occurring in nonreproductive contexts
   (nonsexual bonding, group-level cooperation). We then perform a
   qualitative review of existing literature to address the correlative and
   causal association between measures of HPA-axis activity (glucocorticoid
   levels or GCs) and each of these types of social behavior. As expected,
   elevated HPA-axis activity can inhibit social behavior associated with
   initial social tendencies (approaching conspecifics) and reproduction.
   However, elevated HPA-axis activity may also enhance more elaborate
   social behavior outside of reproductive contexts, such as alloparental
   care behavior. In addition, the effect of GCs on social behavior can
   depend upon the sociality of the stressor (cause of increase in GCs) and
   the severity of stress (extent of increase in GCs). Our review shows
   that the while the associations between stress responses and sociality
   are diverse, the role of HPA-axis activity behind social behavior may
   shift toward more facilitating and less inhibiting in more social
   species, providing insight into how stress physiology and social systems

Abstract = {{In the animal kingdom, behavioral variation among individuals has often
   been reported. However, stable among-individual differences along a
   behavioral continuumreflective of personality variationhave only
   recently become a key target of research. While a vast body of
   descriptive literature exists on animal personality, hypothesis-driven
   quantitative studies are largely deficient. One of the main constraints
   to advance the field is the lack of suitable model organisms. Here, we
   explore whether N.furzeri could be a valuable model to bridge
   descriptive and hypothesis-driven research to further unravel the
   causes, function and evolution of animal personality. As a first step
   toward this end, we perform a common garden laboratory experiment to
   examine if behavioral variation in the turquoise killifish
   Nothobranchius furzeri reflects personality divergence. Furthermore, we
   explore if multiple behavioral traits are correlated. We deliver proof
   of principle of personality variation among N.furzeri individuals in
   multiple behavioral traits. Because of the vast body of available
   genomic and physiological information, the well-characterized ecological
   background and an exceptionally short life cycle, N.furzeri is an
   excellent model organism to further elucidate the causes and
   implications of behavioral variation in an eco-evolutionary context.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits are related to many aspects of one's life, including
   risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive
   substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and
   behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
   To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles:
   bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence
   test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and
   were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior)
   following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were
   0.0\%, 0.1\% and 0.5\% (v/v\%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters
   evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance
   traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or
   exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0\%
   alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish.
   However, 0.5\% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal,
   while both 0.1\% and 0.5\% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our
   results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected
   differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to
   behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish
   as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social
   behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens.}},

Title = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes in amphibians: a review of

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on
   individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that
   knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here
   we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental
   approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist
   with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field
   (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that
   frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral
   syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and
   activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic
   lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in
   morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable
   detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and
   ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make
   important contributions to our understanding of the development and
   proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some
   emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and
   state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered
   the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on
   a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we
   argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal
   personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a
   novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of
   captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally
   compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive
   potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral
   types for release.
   Significance statement
   Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in
   nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We
   summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and
   emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a
   model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological
   consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight
   that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation
   implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs.}},

Title = {{Inbreeding affects personality and fitness of a leaf beetle}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation, which are mostly anthropogenically
   caused, can lead to decreasing population sizes for many species.
   Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression
   can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in
   inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on
   fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon
   cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural
   phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by
   inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression
   both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice
   during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is,
   activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent
   across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles
   differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were
   affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age.
   Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment
   than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in
   specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they
   reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits,
   the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected
   by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and
   thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased
   fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals
   might affect the further development and survival of populations and
   thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the
   ecosystem. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the ways in which individuals cope with threats, respond
   to challenges, make use of opportunities and mediate the harmful effects
   of their surroundings is important for predicting their ability to
   function in a rapidly changing world. Perhaps one of the most essential
   drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced
   during their early-life development. Although the study of coping,
   defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges,
   has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has
   repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping
   behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this
   review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines
   of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours
   (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of
   coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2),
   which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating
   coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which
   influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4)
   and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of
   coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a
   fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents,
   habitat, nutrition, social group and stress are discussed using examples
   from empirical studies on mammals, fish, birds and other animals. In the
   discussion, we address important problems that arise when studying the
   development of coping behaviours and suggest solutions.}},

   American Cockroach (Blattodea: Blattidae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Positive thigmotactic behavior is associated with the ability to hide
   from predators and is important to explain aggregation and collective
   patterns in various animals. For example, this behavior has been
   observed in woodlice, domiciliary cockroaches, ants, and fish. Lately,
   research on different species is focused on the importance of animal
   personality for ecological and evolutionary processes, individual
   fitness and group cohesion. In fact, it is generally expected to find
   some degree of interindividual consistent differences for a behavior,
   unless specific circumstances, like predator attacks, hide the presence
   of personalities. In this research, we analyzed the individual
   thigmotactic preference of domiciliary cockroaches (Periplaneta
   americana (Linnaeus, 1758) (Blattodea: Blattidae)) and how it affected
   the fleeing behavior of isolated individuals inside a shelter after
   receiving a light stimulus. We notably highlight how isolated
   individuals show different consistent preferences regarding their
   position in the shelter, which is due to the individual thigmotaxis
   level, before the fleeing behavior. During the fleeing itself,
   cockroaches nearer to the wall, and therefore with more positive
   thigmotaxis, showed slower reaction lantencies to the stimulus. We
   propose that thigmotaxis homogenizes the interindividual differences
   among individuals and is important to explain the individual and
   collective fleeing behavior.}},

Abstract = {{An emergent field of animal personality necessitates a method for
   repeated high-throughput quantification of behavioral traits across
   contexts. In this study, we have developed an automated video stimulus
   approach to sequentially present different contexts relevant to five
   personality traits (exploration, boldness, neophobia, aggression, and
   sociability), successfully quantifying repeatable trait measurements in
   multiple individuals simultaneously. Although our method is designed to
   quantify personality traits in zebrafish, our approach can accommodate
   the quantification of other behaviors, and could be customized for other
   species. All digital materials and detailed protocols are publicly

Volume = {{285}},

Abstract = {{Variation in predation risk is a major driver of ecological and
   evolutionary change, and, in turn, of geographical variation in
   behaviour. While predation risk is rarely constant in natural
   populations, the extent to which variation in predation risk shapes
   individual behaviour in wild populations remains unclear. Here, we
   investigated individual differences in reproductive behaviour in 16
   Trinidadian guppy populations and related it to the observed variation
   in predator biomass each population experienced. Our results show that
   high heterogeneity in predator biomass is linked to individual
   behavioural diversification. Increased within-population heterogeneity
   in predator biomass is also associated with behavioural polymorphism.
   Some individuals adjust the frequency of consensual mating behaviour in
   response to differences in sex ratio context, while others display
   constantly at elevated frequencies. This pattern is analogous to a `live
   fast, die young' pace-of-life syndrome. Notably, both high and low mean
   differences in predator biomass led to a homogenization of individual
   frequency of consensual mating displays. Overall, our results
   demonstrate that individual behavioural variation is associated with
   heterogeneity in predator biomass, but not necessarily with changes in
   mean values of predator biomass. We suggest that heterogeneity in
   predator biomass is an informative predictor of adaptive responses to
   changes in biotic conditions.}},

Title = {{Consistently bolder turtles maintain higher body temperatures in the
   field but may experience greater predation risk}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral ecologists have assumed that animals will optimize behavior
   to match their current situation, yet studies reveal limited behavioral
   flexibility and extensive variation among individuals in their response
   to a similar stimulus. This phenomenon is referred to as ``animal
   personality,{''} and recent efforts seek to determine the implications
   of personality for interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment.
   Doing so promises to illuminate how selection is operating on behavioral
   traits and, consequently, how stable, among-individual variation in
   behavioral types is maintained evolutionarily. We examined a natural
   population of forest-dwelling eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina)
   to understand the effects of differences in levels of boldness on
   thermoregulatory behavior, injury history, and movement rates. Repeated
   behavioral trials revealed that individual turtles varied consistently
   and dramatically in boldness (latency to emerge from the shell or begin
   moving after handling and confinement). Behavioral differences were
   independent of phenotypic state or environmental conditions, suggesting
   the existence of personality in these turtles. Moreover, bolder turtles
   maintained higher body temperatures in the field and tended to have more
   damage to their shells, possibly indicative of more frequent predation
   attempts. Little work has been done on personality in terrestrial
   ectotherms, and this study enhances our understanding of this phenomenon
   by highlighting the potential trade-off between mortality and
   thermoregulation.
   Significance statement
   Animals often exhibit markedly different personality traits from each
   other. We sought to understand how personality traits affect
   interactions with the environment, and thus how natural selection may be
   acting upon and maintaining behavioral variation. We studied this in
   terrestrial ectotherms, box turtles, for whom the trade-off between
   basking and predation risk may be a significant factor. We found that
   individual turtles differed consistently in boldness (time spent hiding
   and immobile after handling) and that bolder turtles maintained higher
   body temperatures but tended to have more injuries on their shells. This
   suggests that being bold is beneficial for thermoregulation, which may
   enhance growth and fecundity, but could expose turtles to greater risk
   of predation. Variation in the expression of boldness may, therefore,
   serve to maintain behavioral variation in the population.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and
   maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population
   in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome)
   behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that
   behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition,
   gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through
   behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are
   labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to
   be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term
   environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood
   remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory
   experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time
   available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on
   activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green
   lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of
   behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency
   (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation
   for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean
   behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual
   behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments.
   Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found
   significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long
   basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but
   affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher
   in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size
   (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking
   treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when
   food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change
   can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect
   could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural
   predictability, but not in behavioural type.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat-specific selection pressures have been widely recognized, but
   whether selection favours different personality types in different
   habitats has rarely been evaluated. This study aimed to test whether
   personality-related differences in annual reproductive success differed
   between two populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) occupying
   different Mediterranean habitats (oakwood and pinewood). We measured
   exploration and parental provisioning behaviours and used a path
   analysis to ask how the interplay between these two behavioural traits
   affected reproductive success in each of these two habitats. We found
   that blue tits breeding in the pinewood were slow-exploring compared to
   blue tits breeding in the oakwood, suggesting the occurrence of
   personality-related differences in settlement, or behavioural plasticity
   in response to habitat. Exploration behaviour and feeding rates were
   positively associated, suggesting that they affect each other or that
   there is an environmental factor affecting both traits simultaneously.
   Finally, fast explorers were favoured in the pinewood, while there was
   no selection acting on exploration behaviour in the oak habitat. These
   findings emphasize the importance of integrating habitat selection,
   plasticity and personality in the study of behavioural evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers increasingly view animal personality traits as products of
   natural selection. We present data that describe the personalities of
   128 eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) currently
   living in or who lived their lives in the Kasekela and Mitumba
   communities of Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We obtained ratings on 24
   items from an established, reliable, well-validated questionnaire used
   to study personality in captive chimpanzee populations. Ratings were
   made by former and present Tanzanian field assistants who followed
   individual chimpanzees for years and collected detailed behavioral
   observations. Interrater reliabilities across items ranged from
   acceptable to good, but the personality dimensions they formed were not
   as interpretable as those from captive samples. However, the personality
   dimensions corresponded to ratings of 24 Kasekela chimpanzees on a
   different questionnaire in 1973 that assessed some similar traits. These
   correlations established the repeatability and construct validity of the
   present ratings, indicating that the present data can facilitate
   historical and prospective studies that will lead to better

Title = {{The multidimensional behavioural hypervolumes of two interacting species
   predict their space use and survival}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals differ consistently in their behaviour, thus
   impacting a wide variety of ecological outcomes. Recent advances in
   animal personality research have established the ecological importance
   of the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by individuals and
   by multispecies communities. Here, we examine the degree to which the
   multidimensional behavioural volume of a group predicts the outcome of
   both intra-and interspecific interactions. In particular, we test the
   hypothesis that a population of conspecifics will experience low
   intraspecific competition when the population occupies a large volume in
   behavioural space. We further hypothesize that populations of
   interacting species will exhibit greater interspecific competition when
   one or both species occupy large volumes in behavioural space. We
   evaluate these hypotheses by studying groups of katydids (Scudderia
   nymphs) and froghoppers (Philaenus spumarius), which compete for food
   and space on their shared host plant, Solidago canadensis. We found that
   individuals in single-species groups of katydids positioned themselves
   closer to one another, suggesting reduced competition, when groups
   occupied a large behavioural volume. When both species were placed
   together, we found that the survival of froghoppers was greatest when
   both froghoppers and katydids occupied a small volume in behavioural
   space, particularly at high froghopper densities. These results suggest
   that groups that occupy large behavioural volumes can have low
   intraspecific competition but high interspecific competition. Thus,
   behavioural hypervolumes appear to have ecological consequences at both
   the level of the population and the community and may help to predict
   the intensity of competition both within and across species. (C) 2017

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{147-153}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes (i.e. population-level behavioural correlations)
   arise when individuals, on average, maintain the same behavioural
   expression across different ecological contexts. Population-level
   syndromes can appear maladaptive, such as when prey remain active across
   the absence and presence of a sit-and-wait predator. Yet in nature,
   individuals often vary in syndrome adherence, exhibiting
   individual-level differences in behavioural plasticity. Here, I use an
   experiment to show that individual behavioural plasticity (a reduction
   in activity level in the presence of predation threat) increases a
   prey's likelihood of surviving predator exposure, and further predicts
   survival better than single-context activity level measures. In an
   additional experiment, I identify conditioning (nonlethal predator
   exposure) as a process that reduces prey activity level. This work
   demonstrates that although population-level behavioural syndromes can
   appear maladaptive, behavioural plasticity and conditioning could
   potentially ameliorate negative effects at the individual level. (C)

Title = {{Rapid divergence of animal personality and syndrome structure across an

Abstract = {{Intraspecific trait variation, including animal personalities and
   behavioural syndromes, affects how individual animals and populations
   interact with their environment. Within-species behavioural variation is
   widespread across animal taxa, which has substantial and unexplored
   implications for the ecological and evolutionary processes of animals.
   Accordingly, we sought to investigate individual behavioural
   characteristics in several populations of a desertdwelling fish, the
   Australian desert goby (Chlamydogobius eremius). We reared first
   generation offspring in a common garden to compare non-ontogenic
   divergence in behavioural phenotypes between genetically interconnected
   populations from contrasting habitats (isolated groundwater springs
   versus hydrologically variable river waterholes). Despite the genetic
   connectedness of populations, fish had divergent bold-exploratory traits
   associated with their source habitat. This demonstrates divergence in
   risk-taking traits as a rapid phenotypic response to ecological
   pressures in arid aquatic habitats: neophilia may be suppressed by
   increased predation pressure and elevated by high intraspecific
   competition. Correlations between personality traits also differed
   between spring and river fish. River populations showed correlations
   between dispersal and novel environment behaviours, revealing an
   adaptive behavioural syndrome (related to dispersal and exploration)
   that was not found in spring populations. This illustrates the adaptive
   significance of heritable behavioural variation within and between
   populations, and their importance to animals persisting across
   contrasting habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Conscientiousness is a fundamental aspect of human personality, one that
   is closely linked with various favorable life outcomes. Despite its
   importance in humans, conscientiousness has received little attention as
   to how it may have evolved, or whether it provides similar fitness
   benefits in other animals. To date, research in animal personality has
   found consistent support for the presence of all major dimensions of
   human personality in other animals except conscientiousness. In this
   review, we investigate conscientiousness at the level of traits and
   facets (clusters of closely related traits). A systematic review of the
   literature retrieved 876 relevant publications describing attributes of
   conscientiousness in other animal species. A factor analysis of citation
   counts revealed 2 major dimensions representing 9 distinct facets of
   conscientiousness in nonhumans. These facets, together with their
   underlying personality traits, exhibit individual variability, are
   generally known to be heritable, and often offer clear fitness benefits
   to individuals. Other facets of conscientiousness appear to be unique to
   humans. Publication biases, research biases, and anthropomorphism may
   all play a role in the structure of the evidence we report. We conclude
   by suggesting fruitful areas of future research to further elucidate the
   presence and functional roles of conscientiousness in animals.}},

Title = {{Individual differences are consistent across changes in mating status
   and mediated by biogenic amines}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although aspects of an individual's state are well-known to influence
   the expression of behavior, it is still unclear how elements of state
   affect consistent among-individual differences in behavior. With binary,
   irreversible elements of state, such as mating status, there may be
   optimal behavioral phenotypes before and after mating, with individuals
   often prioritizing mate acquisition before and resource acquisition
   after. Yet, limited plasticity may prevent optimal behavior in both
   contexts. Additionally, it remains largely unknown if some consistencies
   in neural or physiological traits may limit the ability of the organism
   to respond to state changes. In this study, we investigated how changes
   in a binary state variable, mating status, affected both the mean
   expression and amongindividual variation in behavior and web structure
   of the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti. Furthermore, we explored
   the role of biogenic amines in potentially mediating individual
   differences in behavior and web structure. We found that mated females
   were overall more aggressive than virgin females and also built webs
   structured primarily for capturing prey rather than safety. We also
   found that individual differences in behavior and web structure were
   maintained across mating statuses, which indicates the stability of
   these traits and may drive personality-specific state-dependent fitness
   trade-offs. Finally, we found that aggressive spiders had higher central
   nervous system dopamine levels. Interestingly, web structure was often
   correlated with a catabolite of tyramine (N-acetyltyramine), suggesting
   that variation in amine catabolism, and not the concentrations of the
   amines themselves, may drive individual differences in some traits.
   Significance statement
   Our results demonstrate that although individuals show plasticity in
   response to changes in state, specifically mating status, individuals
   also maintain among-individual differences across this state change.
   Thus, aggressive individuals before mating will tend to be aggressive
   after. This maintenance of individual differences across state may drive
   differential fitness benefits before and after mating for different
   behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that biogenic amines and
   their catabolites are related to individual differences, thus
   identifying a potential mechanism underlying consistent variation.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has explored links between cognition and personality,
   with prominent hypotheses proposing that personality drives consistent
   individual differences in cognitive function. These hypotheses
   particularly expect bolder individuals to be faster, but less accurate,
   as a trade-off in cognitive function. However, cognitive processes are
   typically interconnected and defined in more complex terms than simply
   speed and accuracy. Here, we present evidence that personality-based
   differences in learning rates are a result of differences in
   decision-making during training in a two-alternative forced-choice
   spatial memory task. This was examined in the mormyrid fish Gnathonemus
   petersii in the presence of light, where both vision and the electric
   sense are available, and in the dark, where visibility is limited and
   fish rely mostly on electrosensing. The species is adapted for the dark
   to avoid visual predators; thus, the presence of light can induce
   high-risk and the dark low-risk. We show that light conditions had
   little effect on learning, with bolder fish learning faster both in the
   light and in the dark conditions. Yet the relationship between learning
   rates and error rates indicates that the effect on learning is
   indirectly influenced by accuracy during training. Speed-accuracy
   trade-offs were not found in decision-making, with bolder individuals
   deciding faster and more accurately both in the light and in the dark.
   Only learning strategy was affected by light conditions, with
   significantly more fish preferring response to place learning in the
   dark than in the light, where distal cues were not visible. We conclude
   that other than effects from the integration of visual information,
   bolder individuals show a consistently greater tendency to explore and
   find food rewards during training. This affects their decision-making
   and in turn their learning performance. We highlight the complexity by
   which personality-based effects are exhibited in spatial associative
   learning.}},

Title = {{Determinants, selection and heritability of docility in wild eastern
   chipmunks (Tamias striatus)}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Many behavioural traits show important inter-individual phenotypic and
   genetic variation despite strong potential selection that should reduce
   this variability. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental
   conditions has been proposed to maintain such variation but empirical
   evidences supporting this hypothesis are still scarce for behavioural
   traits. Here, we analysed the repeatability and the ecological and
   individual factors that influence the expression of docility across
   different environmental contexts in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias
   striatus) studied over a period of 10 years. We also estimated the
   heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting
   on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately
   repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age,
   was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and
   decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at
   0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only,
   individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival.
   Our study confirms that docility is both phenotypically and genetically
   variables and that disruptive selection might maintain the variability
   in this trait.
   Significance statement
   Documenting the factors allowing the maintenance of phenotypic and
   genetic variation of behavioural traits within natural populations is a
   central objective in ecology and evolution. Here, we studied a wild
   eastern chipmunk population over 10 years and recorded docility, a
   personality trait, on both juveniles and adults. We showed that docility
   was repeatable and that it was also heritable and influenced by
   different individual and environmental factors. Importantly, we also
   found that disruptive viability selection was acting on adult docility
   independently of environmental variations. Our results show that
   docility is both phenotypically and genetically variable and that
   patterns of selection acting on this trait can maintain personality
   heterogeneity across temporally varying environmental conditions in the
   wild.}},

Title = {{Coping Style Modifies General and Affective Autonomic Reactions of
   Domestic Pigs in Different Behavioral Contexts}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Based on individual adaptive strategies (coping), animals may react
   differently to environmental challenges in terms of behavior and
   physiology according to their emotional perception. Emotional valence as
   well as arousal may be derived by measuring vagal and sympathetic tone
   of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). We investigated the
   situation-dependent autonomic response of 16 domestic pigs with either a
   reactive or a proactive coping style, previously selected according to
   the backtest which is accepted in piglets to assess escape behavior. At
   11 weeks of age, the pigs were equipped with an implantable telemetric
   device, and heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and their respective
   variabilities (HRV, BPV) were recorded for 1 h daily over a time period
   of 10 days and analyzed in four behavioral contexts (resting, feeding,
   idling, handling). Additionally, the first minute of feeding and
   handling was used for a short-term analysis of these parameters in 10-s
   intervals. Data from day 1-3 (period 1) and day 8-10 (period 2) were
   grouped into two separate periods. Our results revealed general
   differences between the coping styles during feeding, resting and
   handling, with proactive pigs showing higher HR compared to reactive
   pigs. This elevated HR was based on either lower vagal (resting) or
   elevated sympathetic activation (feeding, handling). The short-term
   analysis of the autonomic activation during feeding revealed a
   physiological anticipation reaction in proactive pigs in period 1,
   whereas reactive pigs showed this reaction only in period 2. Food intake
   was characterized by sympathetic arousal with concurrent vagal
   withdrawal, which was more pronounced in proactive pigs. In contrast,
   neither coping style resulted in an anticipation reaction to handling.
   Vagal activation increased in reactive pigs during handling, while
   proactive pigs showed an increase in sympathetically driven arousal in
   period 2. Our findings confirm significant context-related differences
   in the general autonomic reaction of pigs with different coping styles.
   Additionally, the two coping styles differ in their affective appraisal
   over the time course of the experiment, underlining the importance of
   taking individual differences into account when studying affect and
   emotion in humans and animals.}},

Title = {{Active and explorative individuals are often restless and excluded from
   studies measuring resting metabolic rate: Do alternative metabolic rate
   measures offer a solution?}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{It has often been proposed that bolder, more explorative or more active
   individuals also have a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR), indicating
   metabolic costs of these personality types. However, such individuals
   might often be restless and thus excluded from RMR datasets, leading to
   a significant sampling bias. We tested (1) whether such a bias occurs
   when animals are measured for a relatively common but short time period
   of 3 h, and if so, (2) whether alternative measures of metabolic rate,
   that allow the incorporation of non-resting individuals, would reveal
   associations between metabolism and personality. For this, we studied
   free-living individuals of the African striped mouse (Rhabdottlys
   pumilio) both during the moist season (N = 25 individuals) with high
   food availability and the dry season (N = 48 individuals) with low food
   availability. We assessed variation in the latency to explore a novel
   object, and the time spent active and time spent in the centre of a
   neutral arena. We examined links between personality and (i) RMR and
   (ii) four alternative metabolic rate (MR) metrics: average MR, highest
   MR, lowest MR and span of MR. Twenty-nine percent of the measured
   individuals had to be excluded from our RMR study because they remained
   restless during respirometry trials. Striped mice showed a behavioural
   syndrome where fast explorers also spent more time in centre and more
   time active than slow explorers. Individuals that did not rest during
   respirometry trials were faster explorers and in the moist season, they
   were also more active and spent more time in the centre than individuals
   that rested. We found no relationship between RMR and the behavioural
   syndrome, which might be due to the exclusion of individuals with a
   certain behavioural type, leaving a subset of compliant individuals. In
   the moist season, we found positive relationships between the
   behavioural syndrome and span of MR and lowest MR. In the dry season,
   low food availability may mask links between the behavioural syndrome
   and alternative MR measures due to reduced overall activity in striped
   mice. Our study demonstrated the importance to consider personality when
   measuring RMR and suggests that some alternative MRs may be useful to
   examine relationships between metabolism and personality when it is
   impossible to measure individuals over extended time periods. (C) 2017

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The existence of personality in nonhuman animals is widely accepted, but
   the development of valid and reliable methods to measure and interpret
   it is ongoing. Personality can be important in selecting horses for
   particular roles and has the potential to improve welfare and safety for
   riders and horses. This is especially important for challenging roles
   such as police work. A custom-made behavioral test protocol was trialed
   with the Belgian mounted police, aimed at complementing the existing
   subjective rating of potential new police horses by experienced mounted
   police officers. A sample of 48 active police horses was used to assess
   the feasibility of the protocol and to establish an initial reference
   population for future comparison. The protocol was a continuous program
   of 9 tests in an indoor arena, including tests of responses to solitary
   activity and sudden stimuli and interactions with humans and
   conspecifics. This program yielded 10 Likert scores and 115 continuous
   variables, including locomotory responses, rolling, whinnying, and
   distance categories where relevant and feasible. A first test for the
   discriminative power of the behavioral selection protocol was the
   comparison of the well-suited to the less-suited police horses in the
   sample. Only 6 of the 125 variables, divided over 4 of the 9 tests,
   showed a significant difference. Overall, this study showed that a
   custom-made behavioral testing protocol is feasible for a working
   mounted-police unit. Although it established an initial reference
   population, the protocol did not allow a clear distinction between the
   well-suited and less-suited police horses currently active. As such,
   this study represents the first phase of the development of a valid and
   reliable protocol to support selection of police horses with behavioral
   test results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Understanding repeatability and plasticity in multiple dimensions of the
   sociability of wild female kangaroos}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sociability, how individuals interact with conspecifics, is considered
   to be a key axis of animal personality. Consistent differences between
   individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some
   taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability
   across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious
   species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although
   repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both
   important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been
   studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple
   behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is
   still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of
   sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to
   determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two
   broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population
   of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to
   investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals'
   states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected
   each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed
   factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to
   reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different
   conspecifics with which individuals associated (their `choosiness' of
   social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were
   all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older
   dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more
   selective about group members when there was more food, and when they
   were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences
   exist among females in this population, and females' measures of
   sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long
   term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals'
   states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females'
   patterns of sociability over shorter periods. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{Finding a high quality territory is essential for many animals to
   reproduce successfully. Despite its importance for fitness, we know
   little about the process of territory prospecting in wild birds, and
   whether individual traits and behaviours, such as personality, co-vary
   with territory prospecting. Here, we use long-term data from a wild,
   insular house sparrow Passer domesticus population to test three
   hypotheses about territory fidelity and prospecting: 1) house sparrows
   show high territory fidelity between years and also during winter. 2)
   Individuals will prospect for a breeding territory during their first
   winter whereas older, more experienced individuals will keep a territory
   from previous years and will, therefore, show no or reduced winter
   territory prospecting. 3) More active behavioural types will prospect
   more than less active behavioural types. We use data from four winters
   from automatically, daily recorded nest-box visits of 188 birds of known
   age. The number of nest-boxes that each individual visited within each
   winter was used as a proxy of winter territory prospecting. We show that
   house sparrows visit multiple nest-boxes during their first winter,
   whereas older individuals keep territories year-round and, potentially
   because of this, indeed show reduced winter territory prospecting.
   Activity was not associated with the number of nest-boxes visited.
   Further research is needed to investigate whether time of territory and
   mate acquisition differs among individuals and the possible effect on
   lifetime fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization aims at combining valuable traits from two species into a
   single group. Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (NT) and Black-chinned
   tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (BCT) are respectively characterized
   by fast growth and water salinity tolerance which attract the breeders
   who could take advantage of both species. The first step is to
   characterize both species behavior in different contexts. The aim of
   this study was to compare the self-feeding behaviour between NT and BCT
   with a design allowing to reveal individual and group feed demand
   behaviour and then to identify the individual specialization that builds
   around the device and the Mod dispenser. The second objective was to
   estimate the links between the individual specialization and personality
   traits. To this aim, we recorded feed demand behaviour of both species
   using a computerized self-feeding device (two tanks for each species
   containing 20 PIT-tagged individuals with a male-female ratio of about
   47\%). Personality traits of all individuals were subsequently
   characterized with an open field test (OFT). The links between
   feed-demand and personality were then analyzed. Growth performances were
   not significantly different between NT and BCT but there was a strong
   tank effect. The individual specialization was similar in NT and BCT
   and,similar to that previously observed in sea bass i.e. 1-3 individuals
   responsible for most of the feed demand activity in the tanks. Most NT
   individuals stayed in the shelter during the open field test while most
   of BCT individuals moved out of it. Overall, NT were shyer than BCT or
   the OFT was not adapted to NT. Linking the results of the self-feeding
   experiment and OFT in BCT, we found a strong positive correlation
   between the triggering activity and females' shyness. Fish that spent
   more time inside than outside the shelter and which latency to emerge
   from shelter was longer, were characterized by a higher triggering
   activity (high-triggering fish). This study confirms the NT ability to
   use self-feeder devices and provides the first insight into the same
   ability in BCT and demonstrates links with personality traits. These
   results have a potential interest for the success of BCT and NT
   hybridization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The flexibility of organisms to respond plastically to their environment
   is fundamental to their fitness and evolutionary success. Social insects
   provide some of the most impressive examples of plasticity, with
   individuals exhibiting behavioral and sometimes morphological
   adaptations for their specific roles in the colony, such as large
   soldiers for nest defense. However, with the exception of the honey bee
   model organism, there has been little investigation of the nature and
   effects of environmental stimuli thought to instigate alternative
   phenotypes in social insects. Here, we investigate the effect of
   repeated threat disturbance over a prolonged (17 month) period on both
   behavioral and morphological phenotypes, using phenotypically plastic
   leaf-cutting ants (Atta colombica) as a model system. We found a rapid
   impact of threat disturbance on the behavioral phenotype of individuals
   within threat-disturbed colonies becoming more aggressive, threat
   responsive, and phototactic within as little as 2 weeks. We found no
   effect of threat disturbance on morphological phenotypes, potentially,
   because constraints such as resource limitation outweighed the benefit
   for colonies of producing larger individuals. The results suggest that
   plasticity in behavioral phenotypes can enable insect societies to
   respond to threats even when constraints prevent alteration of
   morphological phenotypes.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-93}},

Abstract = {{Sexual conflict over mating rate often implies that males persist at
   frequently harassing females to gain matings while females resist mating
   attempts. In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous
   pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of
   resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female
   resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used
   Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and
   the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance
   traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable
   and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past
   mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between
   these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment
   and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly
   repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured
   harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment
   and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide
   off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict
   intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding
   frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment
   endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is
   more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles.
   Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm
   that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic
   female resistance.}},

Title = {{Born to win or bred to lose: aggressive and submissive behavioural
   profiles in crickets}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{441-450}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aggression between conspecific males is widespread in the animal
   kingdom, as is the fact that some individuals are far more aggressive
   than others. Consistent interindividual differences in behavioural
   profiles are generally regarded as a hallmark for animal `personality'
   in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their proximate causes are
   poorly understood. While the social experiences of winning and losing
   are known to lead to heightened and depressed aggressiveness,
   respectively, and that different fighting experiences can lead to
   changes in other behaviours, the extent to which interindividual
   variation in aggression and correlated behaviours are determined alone
   by fighting experience, environmental factors or inherited
   predisposition is unclear. In this study, we video tracked individual,
   virgin adult male crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to quantify their
   general motility, exploratory behaviour and attraction to conspecific
   males after 48 h of social isolation, and compared this with their
   performances 24 h later, immediately after a fighting tournament that
   yielded cohorts of aggressive winners and submissive losers. Although
   all known behavioural effects of previous social experience in crickets
   last only a few hours at most, we found significant behavioural
   differences between the 48 h isolated future winners and losers, i.e.
   before the fight tournament. However, the experiences of winning and
   losing led to more pronounced and some additional changes in behaviour.
   We discuss whether these different behavioural profiles associated with
   the chances of winning and losing ('personalities') could arise from
   factors other than fighting experience, or possibly from dominance and
   subjugation experiences gathered under crowded culture conditions before
   social isolation with cumulative effects that may persist longer than
   those presently known. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{The African catfish Clarias gariepinus has a genetic sex determination
   system in which high temperature induces masculinization. The
   thermosensitive period for sex differentiation is short and occurs very
   early (from 6 to 8 days posthatching {[}dph]). As young juveniles can
   encounter high masculinizing temperature (36.5 degrees C) in African
   water points, we aimed to determine the thermal preference of sexually
   undifferentiated juveniles and investigate if they spontaneously move
   toward high masculinizing temperature. Experiments were carried out in
   an environmental continuum (28-28-28 degrees C and 28-32-36.5 degrees
   C)made up of three 50-L aquariums connected together. Four hundred
   larvae from 10 different full-sib progenies were reared successively
   from 2 to 14 dph in these facilities. Before and after thermal
   treatments, fish were reared at 28 degrees C until sex ratio
   determination at 70 dph. In the control continuum, fish were nearly
   equally distributed in the three compartments. Conversely, in the
   thermal continuum, compartment occupation significantly differed with
   progeny and period. During the highly thermosensitive period, two of
   five progenies significantly preferred (54.7\% and 39.8\% occupation)
   the 36.5 degrees C compartment. All tested progenies reared in thermal
   continuum and separated 36.5 degrees C aquarium showed a skewed sex
   ratio toward the male phenotype (78-100\%). Nevertheless, no correlation
   was found between 36.5 degrees C compartment occupation and sex ratio in
   thermal continuum groups. As masculinization temperature could be
   encountered in African water points during the spawning season, we
   discussed the adaptive advantage for the African catfish to display a
   sex differentiation process controlled by a temperature effect. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Personality traits and behavioural syndromes are often assumed to relate
   to life history strategies and lifetime fitness variation and hence may
   be generally under selection. Key in this regard is the, often untested,
   assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are
   maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we
   tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly
   assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of
   sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts
   (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a
   substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless
   of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and
   sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across
   seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability
   estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for
   significant between-individual correlations between the investigated
   traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our
   results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are
   personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term
   but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that
   personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study
   might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This
   long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have
   important implications for the social organization within complex social
   environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant
   processes. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The way how individuals respond to chronic challenges can vary
   tremendously, and such differences are closely linked to personality.
   The few available studies on individual differences in stress-related
   immunosuppression in non-human mammals have been mainly carried out with
   laboratory strains. We conducted a study in male mound-building mice
   (Mus spicilegus) of wild origin. We distinguished between high (HAN) and
   low anxious/ neophobic (LAN) personality types, quantified by subjects'
   consistent and associated behavioral responses in repeated elevated plus
   maze and novel object tests. After reaching maturity, parts of the
   subjects were regularly confronted to different resident pairs over a
   period of 5 days to provoke a condition of chronic social stress, while
   others were used as untreated controls. We measured fecal corticosteroid
   metabolite (FCM) concentrations and different cellular immune parameters
   from blood and spleen. Socially confronted HAN showed higher increases
   in FCM concentrations than LAN, indicating a more pronounced
   physiological stress response in the former personality type. HAN of the
   experimental group also showed lower percentages of effector T cells
   (Teff) and higher regulatory T cells (Treg) in the spleen; the latter
   are known for their immunosuppressive activity. Considering the ratio of
   Teff/Treg, animals with higher increases in FCM concentrations during
   the late period of the experiment showed a stronger shift towards Treg
   cells, supporting immunosuppressive effects of chronically elevated
   corticosteroid levels. Summarizing, our results strongly suggest that
   immunomodulatory effects of socially induced stress were altered by
   individual differences in anxiety/neophobia, emphasizing the
   significance of personality in shaping physiological responses to
   challenge. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Energy state affects exploratory behavior of tree sparrows in a group
   context under differential food-patch distributions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: When facing a novel situation, animals can retreat or leave
   to avoid risks, but will miss potential resources and opportunities.
   Alternatively they may reduce environmental uncertainty by exploration,
   while risking no energy rewards and exposure to hazards, and use the
   information retrieved for subsequent decision making. When exploring,
   however, animals may adopt different tactics according to individual
   states.
   Results: We tested that energy states will affect exploratory behavior
   by experimenting with wild-caught untrained Eurasian tree sparrows
   (Passer montanus) in fasted or fed states exploring in a novel space
   with hidden food supply in different patch distribution patterns. Our
   data revealed that fasted sparrows risked being earlier explorers more
   often, initiated more exploratory bouts before patches were found, and
   stayed longer on the ground under both patch patterns. Fasted sparrows
   discovered more patches and consumed more food than fed sparrows in
   dispersed, but not necessary so in clumped, patch patterns; whereas fed
   birds also increased patch finding to a certain level in dispersed
   patterns. Sparrows of both energy states, however, did not differ in
   feeding rates in either patch pattern.
   Conclusions: Exploratory behavior of tree sparrows is state-dependent,
   which supports our prediction that birds with an energy shortage will be
   risk-prone and explore more readily. Our study also indicates a game
   nature of tree sparrow exploratory behavior in a group context when
   explorers are in different energy states and are exposed to different
   patch distributions. Birds of lower energy state adopting an active
   exploring tactic may be favored by obtaining higher energy gains in
   dispersed patch patterns with lower patch richness. More satiated birds,
   however, achieved a similar feeding rate by lowered exposure time.}},

Title = {{Social context, but not individual personality, alters immigrant
   viability in a spider with mixed social structure}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{153-161}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Immigrant viability is a major determinant of the realized rate of gene
   flow across populations. For social organisms, the social context in
   which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have
   important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use
   social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group
   personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength
   of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending
   on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone,
   (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or
   (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of
   individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and
   not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign
   environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were
   transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates
   compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of
   whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as
   individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among
   populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed
   performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with
   resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results
   are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should
   generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social
   species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch
   in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in
   different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual
   personality traits. These results provide a first glimpse into the
   relative roles of individual personality and social context in mediating
   gene flow among populations from divergent environments. (C) 2016 The

   its original distribution to disturbed areas in the Atlantic Forest
   biome in response to anthropogenic impacts, acting as an invasive
   species (broad sense). In order to evaluate personality, we performed
   three behavioural assays as follows: open field, aversive open field and
   holeboard field. We extracted three personality domains-activity,
   exploration, and neophilia-using principal component analysis. There was
   significant positive correlation between these personality domains
   characterising a behavioural syndrome. We discussed the implications of

Abstract = {{Corvids (Family: CORVIDAE) are a clade of some 120 species widespread
   throughout much of the world that have attracted the interest of
   researchers due to their impressive cognitive abilities. The group is,
   however, also generally described as neophobic, a trait that increases
   the difficulty of undertaking such research. In Australia, Torresian
   crows (Corvus orru) have, like corvid species worldwide, thrived in
   urban environments, sharing this habitat with a number of other corvoid
   (Superfamily: CORVOIDEA) species. While each of these species has
   successfully colonised urban areas, the extent to which neophobia is
   present is not known. This study empirically tested the extent to which
   neophobia is exhibited in wild urban Torresian crows by measuring the
   delaying effect of a novel object to obtaining food and any changes in
   neophobic behaviours displayed. This was then compared with the other
   urban corvoid species that inhabit similar niches. This study confirmed
   that Torresian crows are significantly wary of a novel objects,
   displaying more neophobic behaviours and taking longer to attain the
   food. Crow behaviour provided evidence in support of both the dangerous
   niche hypothesis and the two-factor model of neophobia and neophilia.
   Crows also displayed these behaviours to a significantly greater extent
   than the three other corvoids studied. However, the individual variation
   in crow behaviours when exposed to a novel object was extensive. This
   variation may be attributed to differing behavioural types between
   individuals, or different experiences with novel objects or humans in
   the bird's past.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) varies
   in armour phenotype from fully armoured to non-armoured morphs.
   Aim: Investigate the connection between individual variation in
   behaviour and armour morphology within and across populations.
   Study organism and site: During the Spring of 2015, we assayed the
   behaviour of 250 sticklebacks from seven populations on the Scottish
   island of North Uist, located in the Outer Hebrides.
   Hypotheses: The `phenotypic compensation' hypothesis holds that
   individuals with poorer defences should behave more timidly. Yet the
   energetic costs associated with bearing armour should reduce both the
   activity and exploration behaviour of more heavily armoured individuals.
   Methods: We assayed individual stickleback for boldness, exploration,
   and activity. We then stained the fish with Alizarin red, which allowed
   the characterization of the armour phenotype of each fish.
   Results: Across populations, bold fish were less armoured than their shy
   counterparts and active fish were more armoured. Exploratory behaviour
   was not correlated with armour phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are under threat from
   biological invasions. The ``killer shrimp{''} Dikerogammarus villosus is
   a highly predatory amphipod that has spread readily across Central
   Europe and recently the UK and its arrival has been associated with the
   significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its
   behavioral ecology are sparse, even though its behavior may contribute
   to its invasion success. For the first time, we investigated
   antipredator ``fleeing{''} behavior in D. villosus and how this changed
   with water temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis.
   First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but
   consistent among-individual differences in behavior. These are driven by
   a combination of mean level among-individual differences and
   within-individual relative consistency in behavior, and provide the key
   marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were not
   influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all
   individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus,
   indicating a capacity for individual learning. We suggest that the
   antipredator behavior of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and
   that consistent among-individual differences in behavior may promote
   biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to
   changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous,
   particularly in an era of global climate change, where average
   temperatures could be elevated and less predictable.}},

Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{247-254}},

Abstract = {{Although one of the hallmarks of personality traits is their consistency
   over time, we might expect personality traits to change during life
   history shifts. Becoming a parent is a major life history event, when
   individuals undergo dramatic behavioural and physiological changes. Here
   we employ a longitudinal experiment to ask whether personality changes
   in response to the experience of parenting in male threespine
   sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Life history theory predicts that
   males should be less risk averse after successfully parenting, and the
   neuroendocrinology of parenting suggests that parenting could reorganize
   the hormonal landscape and behaviour of fathers. We randomly assigned
   males to either an experimental group (reproduced and parented) or a
   control group (did not reproduce and parent), and repeatedly measured a
   personality trait ('boldness') and 11-ketotestosterone levels (11-kT,
   the major androgen in fishes) in individual males. In the control group,
   males became bolder over time. However, in the experimental group,
   boldness did not change. Furthermore, 11-kT changed dramatically in the
   experimental group, and changes in 11-kT in parents were associated with
   boldness after parenting ceased. Our study is one of the first to assess
   proximate and ultimate explanations for changes in personality as a
   function of reproduction and parenting. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Personality affects how animals respond to challenging circumstances and
   may affect the success of conservation translocations. To assess
   personality in translocated Stephens' kangaroo rats we exposed animals
   to a mirror to simulate a conspecific and to predator scent. Observers
   made subjective ratings of animals using 16 traits and recorded
   behaviour. We assayed faecal cortisol at time of capture and during
   captivity. We identified three personality dimensions: Assertiveness,
   Excitability, and Persistence. Individuals received similar scores for
   these dimensions in the two tests, suggesting consistent differences
   across context. High-Assertiveness animals showed risky behaviour, and
   had lower baseline cortisol. Assertiveness corresponds to
   `proactive-reactive coping' described for other rodents.
   High-Excitability animals were scored as high for Anxious and Fearful;
   this dimension may correspond to `emotional-reactivity' described in
   rats. Considering personality in translocations may allow selection of
   individuals who better cope with stressors, and may identify individuals
   needing special care to survive translocation.}},

Title = {{Reactions of sheep towards three sets of emotional stimuli:
   (In)Consistency in respect to stimulus valence and sheep identity}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{51-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in affective states in applied animal
   behaviour science, because these states are thought to reflect welfare
   from the perspective of the animals. Also, it can be expected that
   individuals differ in how they consistently react to emotional
   challenges. Recently, we conducted three experiments in which the same
   sheep were repeatedly confronted with either physical, social or thermal
   stimuli that presumably varied in their valence. These sheep had been
   housed in either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable,
   stimulus-rich housing conditions in order to manipulate their long-term
   mood. When the sheep were exposed to the stimuli, we measured general
   activity, ear movements, ear postures and frontal cortical haemodynamic
   changes as indicator variables for their emotional reaction. In the
   meta-analysis presented here, we searched for effects of the presumed
   valence and mood state on the indicator variables. Furthermore, we
   investigated the unexplained between- versus within-subject variability
   as an indicator of personality. Deoxy- {[}HHb] and oxy-haemoglobin
   concentrations {[}O(2)Hb] as well as general activity showed weak linear
   relationships with presumed valence. Sheep from the unpredictable,
   stimulus-poor housing conditions were generally more active and showed
   more ear movements, higher absolute {[}HHb], more transverse ears and
   less left-forward ears than sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich
   housing conditions. However, these differences were small. The ratio of
   between- to within-individual variability was very low indicating little
   consistency in individual reactions. In conclusion, we found only weak
   evidence that presumed valence had a consistent effect on the indicator
   variables for emotional reactions in a given sheep, and these reactions
   were not modulated by presumed mood. Also, there was little indication
   that the sheep reacted in a way reflecting an individualised
   personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The optimal compromise between decision speed and accuracy may depend on
   cognitive ability, associated with the degree of encephalization: larger
   brain size may select for accurate but slow decision-making, beneficial
   under challenging conditions but costly under benign ones. How this
   brain size-dependent selection pressure shapes avian breeding phenology
   and reproductive performance remains largely unexplored. We predicted
   that (1) large-brained individuals have a delayed breeding schedule due
   to thorough nest-site selection and/or prolonged resource acquisition,
   (2) good condition facilitates early breeding independent of relative
   brain size, and (3) large brain size accrues benefits mainly to
   individuals challenged by environmental or intrinsic constraints. To
   test these predictions, we examined how the relative head volume of
   female eiders (Somateria mollissima) of variable body condition
   correlated with their breeding schedule, hatching success and offspring
   quality. The results were consistent with our predictions. First, large
   head size was associated with a progressively later onset of breeding
   with increasing breeding dispersal distance. Second, increasing body
   condition advanced the timing of breeding, but this effect was
   significantly weaker in large-brained females. Third, larger head volume
   was associated with increased hatching success mainly among late
   breeders and those in poor body condition, and duckling body condition
   was positively related to maternal head volume, but only in
   poor-condition mothers. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to
   demonstrate the presence of brain size-related differences in
   reproductive strategies within a single natural population.}},

Abstract = {{Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral
   plasticity, animals live in complex environments wherein multiple
   environmental factors vary simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether
   temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the
   boldness and feeding behavior of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis
   guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can
   behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely
   more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant
   temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred
   thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed
   individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food
   intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we
   demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on
   behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently
   affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these
   factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e.,
   multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert
   multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of
   individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food
   availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how
   animals respond to rapidly changing environments.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on animal behaviour have suggested a link between personality
   and energy expenditure. However, most models assume constant variation
   within individuals, even though individuals vary between observations.
   Such variation is called intraindividual variation in behaviour (IIV).
   We investigate if IIV in the duration of the startle response is
   associated with metabolic rates (MR) in the hermit crab Pagurus
   bernhardus. We repeatedly measured startle response durations and MR
   during each observation. We used double hierarchical generalized linear
   models to ask whether among and IIV in behaviour was underpinned by MR.
   We found no association between the mean duration of the startle
   responses and either routine MR orMR during startle response.
   Nevertheless, we found that IIV increased with MR during startle
   responses and decreased with routine MR. These results indicate that
   crabs with higher MR during startle responses behave less predictably,
   and that predictability is reduced during exposure to elevated
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Correlated suits of behaviors (behavioral syndrome) are commonly
   observed in both inter- and intraspecific studies. In order to
   understand the genetic basis of such a correlation between species, we
   compared ten behaviors classified into five categories (acclimation,
   feeding, normal swimming, reaction to a novel object and activity in a
   novel environment) between two pufferfish species, Takifugu rubripes and
   T. niphobles. The two species showed consistent differences in nine
   behaviors with a significant correlation among behaviors. Quantitative
   trait locus (QTL) analysis using second generation hybrids revealed that
   different sets of small effect QTL are associated with the observed
   interspecific behavioral disparity. This indicates that correlations in
   temperament traits between them are governed by many genes with small
   effects, and each behavior has been selected to form particular
   combination patterns. One of the QTL showing small pleiotropic effect
   includes the Drd4 gene known for its association with behavioral traits
   in some animal taxa including mammals.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{181-190}},

Abstract = {{Recently, carotenoid pigments have received considerable attention as
   modulators of animal health and performance. While studies show that
   elevated carotenoid intake and accumulation can influence activities
   like parental care and escape-flight performance, little is known of how
   carotenoid status influences the expression of animal personality
   traits, which can be energy-demanding and entail survival costs but also
   rewarding in the context of foraging and mating. We experimentally
   investigated the effects of carotenoid availability on exploratory
   behavior and activity level, using adult males and females of two
   species of waterfowl: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail
   (Anas acuta). We assessed behavior using a novel-environment test
   designed to measure an individual's response to novel objects and a
   potential predator threat (fox urine scent). We found that carotenoid
   availability was positively associated with some aspects of exploratory
   behavior: birds with higher concentrations of circulating carotenoids
   entered the test arena sooner and approached and entered
   predator-scented bedding material more frequently than birds with low
   carotenoid concentrations. These results suggest that the availability
   of carotenoid resources can influence personality traits in waterfowl,
   and we discuss putative physiological mechanisms underlying this effect.

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) forms cohesive groups
   despite using an extremely ephemeral roost, partly due to the use of two
   acoustic signals that help individuals locate roost sites and group
   members. While the calls that aid in group cohesion are commonly used,
   some bats rarely or never produce them. Here, we examine whether the
   differences observed in the contact calling behaviour of T. tricolor are
   repeatable; that is, whether individual differences are consistent. We
   recorded contact calls of individuals in the field and rates and
   patterns of vocalization. To determine whether measured variables were
   consistent within individuals, we estimated repeatability (R), which
   compares within-individual to among-individual variance in behavioural
   traits. Our results show that repeatability for call variables was
   moderate but significant, and that repeatability was highest for the
   average number of calls produced (R = 0.46-0.49). Our results
   demonstrate important individual differences in the contact calling
   behaviour of T. tricolor; we discuss how these could be the result of
   mechanisms such as frequency-dependent selection that favour groups
   composed of individuals with diverse vocal strategies. Future work
   should address whether changes in social environment, specifically group
   membership and social status, affect vocal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Intensively reared piglets may face many early life challenges and these
   may affect behavior. The objective of this study was to examine the
   relationship between piglets' early life circumstances and their
   behavioral response in a backtest. Here, 992 piglets of 14 d of age were
   subjected to a backtest, in which they were restrained for 1 min in a
   supine position. The number of struggles in the backtest was assessed in
   relation to data on ADG, BW, BW relative to litter mates, teat order,
   litter size, and health. Piglets that had a lower ADG from birth until
   the test day were struggling more (b = -2.4 g ADG/struggle; P = 0.03).
   Also, piglets with a lower BW at 14 d of age tended to respond more
   actively in the backtest (b = -0.03 kg/struggle; P = 0.08). The response
   to the backtest was unrelated to ADG from birth until weaning, birth
   weight, weaning weight, teat order, litter size, and health. ADG and BW
   were unrelated to the variation of backtest responses within the litter.
   The weak though significant relationship suggests that smaller,
   slower-growing piglets more actively respond to a challenge, either
   because piglets born with such a behavioral response were better able to
   survive, or because piglets adapted their behavioral response to their
   physical condition.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic correlations between behaviors underlying a behavioral syndrome
   may constrain the capacity of a population to respond to selection on
   these behaviors. Average autonomy quantifies the extent in which
   estimated genetic (co)variances constrain the rate of evolutionary
   change of behavioral traits forming a syndrome when these traits are
   under selections in all possible directions of multivariate trait-space.
   However, it is not clear whether a calculated average autonomy value of
   an observed syndrome constitutes a significant evolutionary constraint
   or not. I here outline an approach for testing evolutionary constraint
   in a syndrome, which is based on comparing the observed genetic
   (co)variance structure to the one where the genetic covariances are
   assumed to be zero and taking onboard the uncertainty in the
   (co)variances between behaviors into the calculations of average
   autonomy. The approach can be implemented in the context of parametric
   bootstrap or Bayesian statistics, and I provide a worked example of the
   latter. I further highlight that when genetic (co)variances are
   unattainable, the between-individual (co)variances act as an interesting
   proxy, which is within reach for many behavioral studies. I provide R
   code for all calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour ecology has become a popular research area, and its importance
   in understanding the evolution, ecology and diversity of life on Earth
   is now fully recognised. More recently, consistent differences between
   individuals (including personality traits) have become the target of
   animal studies, and such differences have been reported in a wide range
   of invertebrate and vertebrate taxa. The study of animal personality has
   expanded in the last decade, and it now benefits from a clear
   theoretical framework, supported by empirical evidence. Many studies
   report that personality traits influence individual fitness, but it is
   not clear how and why this happens. The present review explores this gap
   in the current knowledge and provides a comprehensive perspective of the
   main arguments put forward to explain why individuals' personality
   traits influence their fitness. Specifically, I investigate (a) how is
   personality associated with life-history and reproductive investment,
   (b) how personality traits can represent the basis of mate choice, and
   what are the implications of assortative mating based on personality,
   and (c) how personality can impact the amplitude and outcomes of
   intra-familial conflicts. Additionally, I aim to identify the main
   knowledge gaps on the subject and provide some general guidelines for
   future theoretical and empirical work, and also briefly highlight the
   broad impacts that personality research has for evolutionary biology and
   ecology, as well as for applied conservation.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the consequences of male and female explorative and
   risk-taking behaviors that are components of a behavioral syndrome, as
   well as basic demographic and physical characteristics of three measures
   of reproductive performance in Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri).
   Older individuals of both sexes performed slightly better in measures of
   annual reproductive performance. Age was also positively correlated
   within pairs. In some years, males in better winter body condition
   performed better, whereas higher-performing females were in worse
   condition. Because winter body condition was negatively correlated
   within pairs, males in better condition possibly enabled their mates to
   invest more in reproduction in a given year, losing more body mass than
   low-performing females. Overall, variation in individual male and female
   traits, especially behavioral traits, explained little of the variation
   in annual reproductive performance. That age was identified as the
   single most consistent factor, which was correlated within pairs,
   suggests that experience and compatibility may be more important than
   inherent individual traits. By contrast, when examining reproductive
   performance over multiple years, less explorative and risk-averse males
   produced more offspring over the 3-year study period; the direction of
   relationships of the four behavioral traits in the syndrome was highly
   consistent. This suggests an advantage for linkage of these traits in a
   syndrome, supporting the hypothesis that the combination of traits in
   behavioral syndromes may be a target for selection. Received 11 October

   fitness, individuals' propensities to take risk
   (risk-aversive/risk-prone strategies) have been relatively well studied
   as an individual trait in both vertebrates and a few invertebrates.
   However, very little is known of individual variations in response to
   predation threat in eusocial insects. Here, predation attempts by crab
   spiders (Thomisidae) were simulated and the responses of individual
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were analysed. Individual bees were found
   to vary widely in their response, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
   in ways very similar to the `flee/fight/freeze' fear responses observed
   in vertebrates. The individuals' responses were consistent through time,
   as were other features of their foraging behaviours. It was found that
   an individual's foraging behaviour was linked to its size (large bees
   tended to be `fast foragers and small bees tended to be `slow' foragers)
   and that Bombus terrestris foragers varied in their anti-predator
   strategies. The consequences of consistent individual differences in
   bumblebees for task-division and colony fitness are discussed.}},

Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},

Abstract = {{Among-individual variation in behaviour is a widespread phenomenon, with
   several frameworks developed to explain its existence. Maternal effects,
   which can have significant influence over evolutionary processes, are an
   understudied source of behavioural variation. Maternal effects are not
   necessarily static, however, since their importance can change over
   offspring ontogeny, typically declining with age relative to additive
   genetic effects. Here, using a quantitative genetics approach, we test
   the prediction that maternal effects will influence age-specific
   risk-taking behaviour in Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata.
   Individuals were subject to a single open-field trial as juveniles and
   up to four repeat trials as adults, with five traits indicative of
   risk-taking behaviour measured in each trial. We then partitioned
   phenotypic variance into additive genetic (V-A) and maternal identity
   (V-M) components, in addition to testing brood size and maternal weight
   as specific sources of maternal effects. We found that V-M had
   significant influence over juvenile traits, with very low V-A estimates.
   Whereas, in adults, all traits were significantly heritable, with little
   support for V-M. We also found a strong influence of maternal traits on
   juvenile behaviours as predicted, with significant, albeit smaller,
   effects found in adults. Maternal weight was heritable and itself
   subject to maternal effects. Thus, maternal weight is a likely source of
   maternal genetic effects that are expected to alter response to
   selection on personality in this system. More generally, our study
   highlights that while maternal effects can be an important source of
   personality variation, this varies over ontogeny of offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Urban environments impose novel challenges on animals and, as a result,
   the behaviors of urban wildlife are changing. In particular, high
   exploratory tendencies and an ability to gather more information from
   the environment may facilitate adoption of novel ecological
   opportunities. As of yet, very few studies have examined if urbanization
   predicts the way in which animals explore novel environments, or the
   extent of among-individual variation within these habitats. Here, we
   assess exploration and its temporal plasticity in blackcapped chickadees
   (Poecile atricapillus; N = 169 individuals, 14 sites) caught along an
   urban gradient to examine individual differences in exploration and
   changes in exploration over time and assays under a reaction-norm
   framework. As predicted, urban birds were significantly faster explorers
   in a novel environment (contacted more features and moved more), however
   urbanization did not predict individual differences in the change in
   exploration over time. Exploration score was moderately repeatable;
   interestingly, urban chickadees were more repeatable in their initial
   exploration behaviors, but seemed less repeatable in how they explored
   over time between assays in comparison to forest birds. Our results
   support the importance of high exploratory tendencies for urban animals,
   and suggest, for the first time, that individuals from urban and
   non-urban habitats differ in the amount of among-individual variation in
   exploration, and thus urban individuals may benefit from diverging more
   from one another in their behavior. Future work should examine the
   extent to which this variation in exploration and plasticity of
   exploration behaviors represent differences in how individuals gather
   information from their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Life history strategies for optimizing individual fitness fall on a
   spectrum between maximizing reproductive efforts and maintaining
   physical health over time. Strategies across this spectrum are viable
   and different suites of personality traits evolved to support these
   strategies. Using data from 538 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) we
   tested whether any of the dimensions of chimpanzee personality -
   agreeableness, conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, neuroticism,
   and openness - were associated with longevity, an attribute of slow life
   history strategies that is especially important in primates given their
   relatively long lives. We found that higher agreeableness was related to
   longevity in males, with weaker evidence suggesting that higher openness
   is related to longer life in females. Our results link the literature on
   human and nonhuman primate survival and suggest that, for males,
   evolution has favored the protective effects of low aggression and high
   quality social bonds.}},

Title = {{Temperature preference of cave and surface populations of Astyanax

Abstract = {{Little is known about the genetic basis of behavioral choice, such as
   temperature preference, especially in natural populations. Thermal
   preference can play a key role in habitat selection, for example in
   aquatic species. Examining this behavior on a genetic level requires
   access to individuals or populations of the same species that display
   distinct temperature preferences. Caves provide a uniquely advantageous
   setting to tackle this problem, as animals colonizing caves encounter an
   environment that generally has a different, and far more stable, annual
   temperature than what is encountered on the outside. Here, we focus on
   cave and surface populations of Astyanax mexicanus, the Mexican tetra,
   and examine temperature preference and strength of temperature
   preference (reflected in the percent of time spent at the optimal
   temperature). We used a tank with a stable temperature gradient and
   automated tracking software to follow individual fish from each
   population. We found that distinct populations of A. mexicanus display
   differences in both temperature preference and strength of preference.
   Hybrid crosses established that these are multigenic traits that
   segregate independently from one another. Temperature preference in many
   aquatic animals is known to shift towards warmer temperatures following
   infection with parasites (akin to a fever response in humans). While
   surface fish infected by the ectoparasite Gyrodactylus turnbulli (a gill
   fluke) displayed a strong fever response, cavefish showed a
   significantly attenuated fever response. This work establishes A.
   mexicanus as a genetically tractable system in which differences in
   temperature preference can be studied in naturally evolved populations.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality can affect individual fitness and the dynamics of
   populations. This study tested variation in risk-avoiding (emergence
   from shells) and risk-taking behaviors (abandoning shells) within a
   cohort of hermit crabs (Clibanarius vittatus) under a range of
   environmental stimuli. The startle response (SR) of individuals to
   predators (negative stimuli) and cues that signal new shells (positive
   stimuli) was measured under contrasting scenarios of shell condition
   (intact vs. damaged). The abandonment response (AR) of the same
   individuals was then measured following entrapment to further test
   consistency in individual behavior. SR varied according to stimuli and
   shell condition, with individuals showing a faster response to predators
   when inhabiting intact shells, than damaged shells that made them more
   vulnerable. Interestingly, the response to gastropod cues was faster
   when individuals were in damaged shells, possibly reflecting greater
   motivation to investigate new resources. When assessing the SR of
   individual subjects, strong correlations were observed across the
   different trial combinations (14 out of the 15), suggesting that the
   behavior of an individual under one set of treatment conditions, is a
   good predictor of its behavior under other conditions. AR similarly
   varied with shell condition, with crabs more likely to abandon damaged,
   rather than intact shells. Multivariate analysis linking these suites of
   behaviors (predator SR + gastropod SR + entrapment AR) highlighted
   consistent among individual variation in behavior driven by distinct
   responses to stimuli. Overall, we show that hermit crabs can exhibit
   unique personality traits that will influence their survival and fitness
   in environments where predation risk and resource availability vary over
   short spatial and temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental perspectives of animal personality enhance our
   understanding of how personality structure changes in relation to life
   stage. Clonal animals are ideal models for developmental studies because
   personality differences can be solely attributed to environmental
   factors. Here, I investigated the presence of personality within a
   species of clonal gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, at different
   developmental stages. For juveniles and adult geckos, I measured
   exploration (reaction to a novel situation) and boldness (risk-prone
   tendency) and evaluated repeatability and correlation of these
   behavioural traits. Each gecko exhibited different exploration and
   boldness with significant repeatability through time but no correlation
   between these behavioural traits. Small juveniles were composed of only
   bold and low explorative individuals but large juveniles and adults were
   composed of various personality type individuals. These results
   demonstrate that subject geckos have a similar personality structure
   across life stages and that exploration and boldness are independent
   personality without forming behavioural syndrome structure. Biased
   composition of personality type between life stages suggests that
   appearance of different personality type individuals during an early
   ontogenetic stage generates personality variation within the clonal
   population. This study provides developmental insight about personality
   structure and its composition in clonal animals living in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists use species traits to predict responses to environmental
   change and, ultimately, to understand the composition of biological
   communities. However, this ignores known and substantial intraspecific
   variation that can have important consequences for species interactions
   and community composition. This within-species variation results from
   two distinct sources: ontogeny and consistent individual differences.
   Ontogeny and consistent differences interact to produce phenotypes, but
   the community-level consequences of this interaction have not been
   studied. Using larval dragonfly communities, I investigate patterns of
   intraguild predation by manipulating (1) consistent individual
   differences in activity rate and (2) the ontogeny of the focal and
   interacting species. I show that activity rate is a consistent
   individual trait but that the effect of activity rate on intraguild
   predation depends on the functional role of an organism in the community
   (predator or prey). An organism's functional role itself varies across
   ontogeny of both the focal and interacting individuals. I suggest that
   ontogeny and consistent individual differences interact to produce
   intraspecific variation, with consequences for species interactions,
   communities, and eco-evolutionary dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in psychopathological research advocate a personality-centred
   model of common mental disorders (CMD). We tested four hypotheses to
   test such a model. First, personality relates to critical life events;
   second, both personality and critical life events relate to CMD; third,
   interaction effects between personality and critical life events relate
   to CMD; fourth, neuroticism explains the majority of variance in
   psychopathology. We analysed data (n = 453) based on seven
   semi-structured interviews from a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort
   study over 30 years spanning years 1979 (age 20) to 2008 (age 50). CMD
   and critical life events were assessed seven times between 1979 and 2008
   and personality domains of neuroticism, extraversion and aggressiveness
   in 1988 and 1993. Aggressiveness and neuroticism related to partnership
   rupture and job loss. Neuroticism related significantly to major
   depression, anxiety disorders, substance-use disorders (SUD) and
   severity of psychopathology. Both partnership rupture and job loss
   related to major depression and severity of psychopathology, but not to
   anxiety disorder or SUD. An interaction effect between neuroticism and
   partnership rupture pointed towards significantly increased SUD
   prevalence. All associations held when additionally adjusted for
   childhood adversity and familial socio-economic status. According to a
   pseudo-R (2), neuroticism explained 51\% of total variance in severity
   of psychopathology over time, while all three personality domains along
   with both partnership rupture and job loss explained 59\% of total
   variance. In conclusion, personality, especially neuroticism, relates
   consistently to repeated measures of psychopathology. These associations
   are independent of and more pervasive than the effects of partnership
   rupture and job loss. Partnership rupture in interaction with
   neuroticism may further increase the risk for SUD. We conclude that
   neuroticism is a fundamental aetiological factor for severe
   psychopathology, but further testing of this model in other longitudinal
   studies is required.}},

Abstract = {{Biologists now recognize that ecology can drive evolution, and that
   evolution in turn produces ecological patterns. I extend this thinking
   to include longer time scales, suggesting that macroevolutionary
   transitions can create phenotypic differences among species, which then
   have predictable impacts on species interactions, community assembly and
   ecosystem functioning. Repeated speciation can exacerbate these patterns
   by creating communities with similar phenotypes and hence ecological
   impacts. Here, I use several experiments to test these ideas in
   dragonfly larvae that occupy ponds with fish, ponds without fish, or
   both. I show that macroevolutionary transitions between habitats cause
   fishless pond species to be more active relative to fish pond
   specialists, reducing prey abundance, shifting prey community
   composition and creating stronger trophic cascades. These effects scale
   up to the community level with predictable consequences for ecosystem
   multi-functioning. I suggest that macroevolutionary history can have
   predictable impacts on phenotypic traits, with consequences for
   interacting species and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The precision and the extent of behavioral thermoregulation are likely
   to provide fitness benefits to ectotherms. Yet the factors driving
   variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its
   usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are
   still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related
   species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species
   level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as
   the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One
   factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles
   typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion.
   Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes
   in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if
   T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ.
   Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of
   36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed
   individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be
   more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not
   significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the
   highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range:
   0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on
   T-set did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the
   major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual
   variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of T-set
   considerably more plausible.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that brain serotonin (5-HT) is one of the central
   mediators of different types of animal personality. We tested this
   assumption infield crickets Gryllus integer using a selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Crickets were selected for slow and rapid
   development and tested for their coping styles under non-stressful
   conditions (time spent exploring a novel object). Resting metabolic
   rate, maximum metabolic rate and latency to resume activity were
   measured under stressful conditions (stress reactivity). Measurements
   were taken (i) before and (ii) during the SSRI treatment. Before the
   SSRI treatment, a strong negative correlation was observed between
   coping style and stress reactivity, which suggests the existence of a
   behavioral syndrome. After the SSRI treatment, the syndrome was no
   longer evident. The results of this study show that 5-HT may be involved
   in regulating behavior not only along a stress reactivity gradient but
   also along a coping styles axis. The relationship between personality
   and the strength and direction of 5-HT treatment on observed behaviors
   indicates trait-like individual differences in 5-HT signaling. Overall,
   these findings do not support recent ideas arising from the pace-of-life
   syndrome (POLS) hypothesis, which predict higher exploration and
   metabolic rates in rapidly developing bold animals.}},

Abstract = {{We tested if consistent individual differences (CIDs) in the behaviour
   of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) from the Laurentian Great Lakes
   could influence their vulnerability to trapping. The sea lamprey is
   invasive in the Upper Laurentian Great Lakes and the target of a
   binational control program. Trapping could be used for control if
   trapping efficiency is unbiased and effective. Our test involved
   comparing the behaviour of sea lamprey collected in the field from a
   trap (n = 42) at a barrier and electrofished (n = 9) downstream of the
   barrier. We quantified each individual's latency to exit an enclosure (a
   measure of exploration), proportion of time spent moving (a measure of
   general activity), and change in activity in response to a putative
   predator cue (a measure of boldness). CIDs were detected for each
   behaviour measured (intraclass correlations: 0.3-0.5). CIDs in behaviour
   also differed between trapped individuals and those collected downstream
   using electrofishing, irrespective of size, sex, and maturity status.
   Trapped individuals decreased their activity in response to a putative
   predator cue, while individuals collected using electrofishing increased
   their activity in response to the cue. Trapped individuals also tended
   to spend a greater proportion of time moving than individuals sampled
   downstream of the trap. However, the two samples of lamprey did not
   differ significantly in time taken to exit an enclosure. The behavioural
   differences between sea lamprey sampled from a trap and those sampled
   downstream of the trap suggest that CIDs in behaviour can influence an
   individual's vulnerability to trapping. (C) 2018 International

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been linked to individual variation in both
   stress physiology and social behaviors, but few studies have
   simultaneously examined covariation between personality traits, stress
   hormone levels, and behaviors in free-living animals. We investigated
   relationships between exploratory behavior (one aspect of animal
   personality), stress physiology, and social and foraging behaviors in
   wild house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). We conducted novel
   environment assays after collecting samples of baseline and
   stress-induced plasma corticosterone concentrations from a subset of
   house finches. We then fitted individuals with Passive Integrated
   Transponder tags and monitored feeder use and social interactions at
   radio-frequency identification equipped bird feeders. First, we found
   that individuals with higher baseline corticosterone concentrations
   exhibit more exploratory behaviors in a novel environment. Second, more
   exploratory individuals interacted with more unique conspecifics in the
   wild, though this result was stronger for female than for male house
   finches. Third, individuals that were quick to begin exploring
   interacted more frequently with conspecifics than slow-exploring
   individuals. Finally, exploratory behaviors were unrelated to foraging
   behaviors, including the amount of time spent on bird feeders, a
   behavior previously shown to be predictive of acquiring a bacterial
   disease that causes annual epidemics in house finches. Overall, our
   results indicate that individual differences in exploratory behavior are
   linked to variation in both stress physiology and social network traits
   in free-living house finches. Such covariation has important
   implications for house finch ecology, as both traits can contribute to
   fitness in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{This paper further develops a new way of modelling evolutionary game
   models with an emphasis on ecological realism, concerned with how
   ecological factors determine payoffs in evolutionary games. Our paper is
   focused on the impact of strategically neutral growth limiting factors
   and background fitness components on game dynamics and the form of the
   stability conditions for the rest points constituted by the
   intersections of the frequency and density nullclines. It is shown that
   for the density dependent case, that at the stationary state, the
   turnover coefficients (numbers of newborns per single dead adult) are
   equal for all strategies. In addition, the paper contains a derivation
   of the EESS (eco-evolutionarily stable states) conditions, describing
   evolutionary stability under limited population growth. We show that
   evolutionary stability depends on the local geometry (slopes) of the
   intersecting nullclines. The paper contains examples showing that
   density dependence induces behaviour which is not compatible with purely
   frequency dependent static game theoretic ESS stability conditions. We
   show that with the addition of density dependence, stable states can
   become unstable and unstable states can be stabilised. The stability or
   instability of the rest points can be explained by a mechanism of
   eco-evolutionary feedback. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests that within-individual plasticity of
   behavioural and physiological traits is limited, resulting in stable
   among-individual differences in these aspects of the phenotype.
   Furthermore, these traits often covary within individuals, resulting in
   a continuum of correlated phenotypic variation among individuals within
   populations and species. This heterogeneity, in turn, affects individual
   fitness and can have cross-generational effects. Patterns of trait
   covariation, among-individual differences, and subsequent fitness
   consequences have long been recognized in reptiles. Here, we provide a
   test of patterns of among-individual heterogeneity in behaviour and
   physiology and subsequent effects on reproduction and offspring fitness
   in the garter snake Thamnophis elegans. We find that measures of
   activity levels vary among individuals and are consistent within
   individuals in reproductive female snakes, indicating stable behavioural
   phenotypes. Blood hormone and glucose concentrations are not as stable
   within individuals, indicating that these traits do not describe
   consistent physiological phenotypes. Nonetheless, the major axes of
   variation in maternal traits describe behavioural and physiological
   phenotypes that interact to predict offspring body condition and mass at
   birth. This differential allocation of energy to offspring, in turn,
   strongly influences subsequent offspring growth and survival. This
   pattern suggests the potential for strong selection on phenotypes
   defined by behaviour-physiology interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In behavioral ecology, state-dependent models are frequently used for
   the explanation of inter-individual variance in personality traits.
   Environmental characteristics are one of the external states which could
   influence this variance. The model predicts that environmental harshness
   should be related to fast life-history personality traits and that these
   traits should be more beneficial for fitness-related behavior in a harsh
   environment. In order to test the state-dependent behavior models in
   humans, we explored the relations between environmental harshness
   (exposure to long-term inter-group conflict), HEXACO personality traits
   and mating success (N = 204). We found that exposure to conflict is
   related to a fast life-history personality profile: lower Honesty,
   Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, followed by higher Extraversion.
   Furthermore, interaction effects showed that high Extraversion and low
   Emotionality are related to higher mating success, but only in a harsh
   environment. All obtained results are in line with state-dependent
   models predictions. Research findings reveal the rich explanatory
   potential of behavioral ecological models in explaining key questions of
   human behavior, such as inter-individual variance in personality.}},

Journal = {{THEORY IN BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we are concerned with how aggregated outcomes of
   individual behaviours, during interactions with other individuals
   (games) or with environmental factors, determine the vital rates
   constituting the growth rate of the population. This approach needs
   additional elements, namely the rates of event occurrence (interaction
   rates). Interaction rates describe the distribution of the interaction
   events in time, which seriously affects the population dynamics, as is
   shown in this paper. This leads to the model of a population of
   individuals playing different games, where focal game affected by the
   considered trait can be extracted from the general model, and the impact
   on the dynamics of other events (which is not neutral) can be described
   by an average background fertility and mortality. This leads to a
   distinction between two types of background fitness, strategically
   neutral elements of the focal games (correlated with the focal game

Title = {{Plasticity in extended phenotype increases offspring defence despite
   individual variation in web structure and behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals actively defend their offspring using a range of behaviours
   from calling and mobbing in birds, to physical grappling in crustaceans,
   and the expression of these behaviours positively scale with offspring
   value. While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very
   little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of
   architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to
   offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent
   individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely
   unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We
   addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti,
   by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour
   and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative
   reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web
   structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of
   web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase.
   Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g.
   eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the
   variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of
   individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation
   drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits,
   suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in
   defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended
   phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in
   some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest
   that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some
   individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and
   vice versa. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Abstract = {{The environment in which animals develop can have important consequences
   for their phenotype. In reptiles, incubation temperature is a critical
   aspect of the early developmental environment. Incubation temperature
   influences morphology, physiology, and behavior of non-avian reptiles,
   however, little is known about how incubation temperature influences
   offspring phenotype and behaviors important to avian survival. To
   investigate whether incubation temperature influences avian behaviors,
   we collected wood duck (Aix sponsa) eggs from the field and incubated
   them at three naturally occurring incubation temperatures (35.0, 35.8,
   and 37.0 degrees C). We conducted multiple repeated behavioral trials on
   individual ducklings between 5 and 15 days post-hatch to assess
   activity, exploratory, and boldness behaviors, classified along a
   proactive-reactive continuum. We measured growth rates and circulating
   levels of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels to
   investigate possible physiological correlates of behavior. Ducklings
   incubated at the lowest temperature displayed more proactive behaviors
   than those incubated at the two higher temperatures. We also found that
   younger ducklings exhibited more proactive behavior than older ducklings
   and males exhibited more proactive behavior than females. Further,
   duckling behaviors were repeatable across time and contexts, indicative
   of a proactive-reactive continuum of behavioral tendencies. However,
   neither corticosterone levels nor growth rates were related to behavior.
   This provides some of the first evidence that incubation temperature, a
   critical parental effect, influences avian offspring behaviors that may
   be important for survival. Our results identify incubation temperature
   as a mechanism that contributes to the development of behavioral traits
   and, in part, explains how multiple behavioral types may be maintained
   within populations.}},

Title = {{Integrating thermal physiology within a syndrome: Locomotion,

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{970-981}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Physiology and temperature can both have a profound influence on
   behaviour and metabolism. Despite this, thermal physiology has rarely
   been considered within the animal personality framework, but could be an
   inherent mechanism maintaining consistent individual differences in
   behaviour, particularly in species that need to thermoregulate (i.e.
   ectotherms).
   Here, we present evidence for a thermal-behavioural syndrome and detail
   how it is linked to variation in habitat selection in an Australian
   lizard, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata.
   We predicted that individuals would occur along a cold-hot
   continuumanalogues to the slow-fast continuum proposed by the
   pace-of-life hypothesiswhereby an individual's placement along a thermal
   physiological axis will correspond with their placement along a
   personality axis. We first tested the thermal-behavioural syndrome by
   measuring the thermal preferences and optimal performance temperature of
   individual skinks and linking it to their activity, exploratory, social
   and boldness behaviours.
   In line with our predictions, we found that individuals with a hot
   thermal type performed optimally at higher temperatures, had faster
   sprint speeds and were more active, explorative and bold relative to
   ``cold{''} thermal types.
   We then monitored each individual's habitat selection within an
   artificial environment containing three microhabitats differing in their
   thermal characteristics.
   We found that an individual's thermal type mediated their use of
   habitat, in which hot individuals utilized a hotter microhabitat more
   regularly than both ``cold{''} and ``intermediate{''} thermal types,
   suggesting that the thermal-behavioural syndrome could drive ecological
   niche partitioning in this species.
   We envisage that the thermal-behavioural syndrome concept is likely to
   extend to other study systems, particularly to ectothermic organisms
   that rely heavily on behavioural thermoregulation to maintain optimal
   body temperature.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{109-121}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social
   environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of
   behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects
   that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male
   Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the
   effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual
   signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness,
   activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation.
   Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic
   sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and
   explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted
   in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of
   changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that
   mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The
   effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were
   far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social
   environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between
   behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the
   average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets
   were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets
   becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the
   nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations
   between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social
   environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our
   current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on
   behaviour. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The neural constraint hypothesis is central to understanding
   decision-making by foraging herbivorous insects which make decisions
   less efficiently when they face multiple choices for numerous resource
   types and/or at high densities instead of a fewer choices. Previous
   studies have also shown the relationship between personality type and
   decision-making style. How personality types correlate with foraging
   efficiency among herbivores is however, largely untested. To answer this
   question, we used a widespread, polyphagous, floriphilic katydid,
   Phaneroptera brevis (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) and two naturalised,
   Asteraceae, food plants, Bidens pilosa and Sphagneticola trilobata, as
   model systems. After we determined each katydid's exploration and
   boldness levels, we examined its foraging efficiency across different
   combinations of floral resource choice and density. We showed: (1) For
   the first time within the Tettigonioidea lineage that this katydid
   exhibits different personality types in exploration and boldness. (2)
   Contrary to our prediction, we did not find any support for the neural
   constraint hypothesis because more floral resource choice at a high
   density did not reduce foraging efficiency. (3) Surprisingly, bold
   katydids tend to be less efficient foragers than shy ones. Our findings
   have enhanced understanding of herbivore behavioural ecology and
   knowledge to better deal with potential pest herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality traits emerge developmentally from the interaction of
   genetic and early environmental factors. Maternal hormones, such as
   androgens (testosterone, T and androstenedione, A4), transferred to
   embryos and egg yolks may simultaneously organize multiple behavioural
   and physiological traits. Although previous studies demonstrated an
   association between the mother's personality and yolk androgen levels,
   the independent effects of the male partner's personality and pair
   combination remains unknown. We test this association using an
   ecological model species for personality research, the great tit (Parus
   major) using multiple approaches: (1) a wild population, (2) a randomly
   mated captive population and (3) an experimental study with
   (dis)assortatively mated pairs from lines selected for fast
   exploration/boldness or slow exploration/shyness. Egg androgen
   concentrations were associated with variation in female personality
   traits, and the experimental data suggested that this is independent of
   male personality: Experimental females from the slow-shy line tended to
   have higher egg T concentrations than females from the fast-bold line,
   with no effect of male personality. Shy females from the wild population
   had higher egg A4 concentration than bold females. However, in the
   correlative data yolk hormones were linked with male personality, as
   well as the interaction between female and male traits: Male handling
   responsiveness correlated negatively with egg A4 concentration in wild
   birds. In randomly mated birds, pairs that were mated assortatively for
   personality had lower egg T concentrations than disassortatively mated
   pairs. Given that egg androgens are known mediators of avian
   personality, our results suggest that maternal hormones might contribute
   to the heritability of personality, may be sensitive to the social
   context of mating, and act as key drivers of individual differences.}},

Abstract = {{Research on animal personality explains the coexistence of distinct
   behavioural phenotypes within a species and demonstrates limits to
   individual plasticity. However, the mechanisms guiding the lifelong
   development of personality should receive more attention, because many
   elements of personality are emergent properties of interactions between
   the environment and an individual's genetic background. In these
   interactions, mechanisms (e.g. genetic regulatory networks, epigenetic
   processes and neuroendocrine regulation) influencing personality may be
   modified. An approach integrating proximate mechanisms with a view of
   lifelong personality development will crucially improve understanding
   stability, plasticity and inter-individual variability of personalities
   and clarify the effects of selection on the phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of individual variation in behavior are often not well
   understood, and potential underlying mechanisms include both intrinsic
   and extrinsic factors, such as early environmental, physiological, and
   genetic differences. In an exploratory laboratory study, we raised
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) under 4 different
   environmental conditions (simulated predator environment, complex
   environment, variable social environment, and control). We investigated
   how these manipulations related to behavior, brain physiology, and gene
   expression later in life, with focus on brain dopamine and serotonin
   levels, turnover rates, and gene expression. The different rearing
   environments influenced behavior and gene expression, but did not alter
   monoamine levels or metabolites. Specifically, compared to control fish,
   fish exposed to a simulated predator environment tended to be less
   aggressive, more exploratory, and more neophobic; and fish raised in
   both complex and variable social environments tended to be less
   neophobic. Exposure to a simulated predator environment tended to lower
   expression of dopamine receptor DRD4A, a complex environment increased
   expression of dopamine receptor DRD1B, while a variable social
   environment tended to increase serotonin receptor 5-HTR2B and serotonin
   transporter SLC6A4A expression. Despite both behavior and gene
   expression varying with early environment, there was no evidence that
   gene expression mediated the relationship between early environment and
   behavior. Our results confirm that environmental conditions early in
   life can affect phenotypic variation. However, the mechanistic pathway
   of the monoaminergic systems translating early environmental variation
   into observed behavioral responses was not detected. (C) 2018 S. Karger

Abstract = {{Utilisation of animal personality has potential benefit for conservation
   management. Due to logistics of robust behavioural evaluation in situ,
   the majority of studies on wild animals involve taking animals into
   captivity for testing, potentially compromising results. Three in situ
   tests for evaluation of boldness in San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis
   mutica) were developed (ENOT: extended novel object test; RNOT: rapid
   novel object test; TH: trap/handling test). Each test successfully
   identified variation in boldness within its target age class(es). The TH
   test was suitable for use across all age classes. Tests were assessed
   for in situ suitability and for quantity/quality of data yielded. ENOT
   was rated as requiring high levels of time, cost and labour with greater
   likelihood of failure. However, it was rated highly for data
   quantity/quality. The TH test was rated as requiring little time, labour
   and cost, but yielding lower quality data. RNOT was rated in the middle.
   Each test had merit and could be adapted to suit project or species
   constraints. We recommend field-based evaluation of personality,
   reducing removal of animals from the wild and facilitating routine
   incorporation of personality assessment into conservation projects.}},

Abstract = {{Using social information can benefit individuals in many ways.
   Responding to alarm signals can, for instance, maximize survival under
   predation risk. However, foraging individuals should consider the
   reliability of such risk-based information to balance antipredator
   behavior and resource acquisition. Receiver decisions could depend on
   personality effects, as individual variation in risk-taking tendencies
   (i.e., boldness) could not only affect receiver perception of the
   signaled threat but also signaler reliability. Recent theoretical models
   support the possibility of coevolution between personality and
   communication strategies. Using a playback experiment, we show that wild
   eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) respond to alarm calls according to
   their own boldness level (measured as consistent individual differences
   in basal vigilance) and that they increase their vigilance response to
   bolder callers potentially considered as more reliable. Further,
   receivers respond to the callers' boldness regardless of their own
   boldness and independently of their familiarity level with callers,
   therefore decoding this information from vocalizations. Such effects of
   individual behavioral variation on the perception and interpretation of
   social information could apply to signals used in a variety of
   ecological contexts.}},

Title = {{Social conformity in solitary crabs, Carcinus maenas, is driven by
   individual differences in behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{131-137}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Group living is widespread in the animal kingdom and recent studies into
   the mechanisms underlying group cohesion and behavioural synchrony have
   highlighted the importance of between-individual behavioural differences
   ('animal personality'). In group-living animals, social conformity
   occurs when animals compromise their own behaviour to the level of a
   certain behaviour displayed by another individual or a group, and the
   degree to which individuals conform can depend upon interindividual
   differences in behavioural types. Social conformity can increase group
   cohesion and ultimately predator avoidance and/or resource acquisition
   for group-living individuals. However, it remains unclear whether
   similar conformity effects exist in solitary species, many of which form
   temporary aggregations and, if so, whether changes in behaviour in the
   presence of conspecifics are dependent on individuals' personalities in
   solitary contexts. We studied the effects of social context (i.e. the
   presence of a conspecific) on behaviour in solitary shore crabs, using
   automated video tracking. Individuals differed consistently in their
   activity levels within and across contexts and were significantly more
   active in solitary than dyadic contexts. No differences in activity
   between same- and opposite-sex dyads were found. Crabs' activity levels
   were more similar when tested together than when tested alone,
   indicating a social conformity effect. Furthermore, more active
   behavioural types decreased their activity to a greater extent when
   paired with a conspecific. The sex composition of the dyad had no effect
   on changes in activity. Overall, our findings suggest that social
   conformity is moderated by individual behavioural differences in a
   solitary organism. It is often presumed that, over evolutionary time,
   the social structure of animal populations has important consequences
   for the evolution of personalities and vice versa. We suggest that
   studying solitary or facultatively social organisms may allow
   researchers to tease out causality between personality differences and
   socioecological dynamics. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{236-243}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence for consistent among-individual variation in
   individual sociability (e.g., tendency to be sociable) in a number of
   species. However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well
   as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate
   into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not
   yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons
   (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual
   variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of
   sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree,
   centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of
   preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences
   in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether
   observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social
   environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in
   social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in
   3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of
   time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found
   that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics
   of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of
   sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers
   of social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{How has evolution led to the variation in behavioural phenotypes
   (personalities) in a population? Knowledge of whether personality is
   heritable, and to what degree it is influenced by the social
   environment, is crucial to understanding its evolutionary significance,
   yet few estimates are available from natural populations. We tracked
   three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a
   pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative
   genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and
   in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in
   adult boldness. We did not detect maternal effects on any traits, but we
   did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness,
   exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a
   behavioural syndrome, suggesting that selection could act independently
   on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no
   consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work
   shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that
   social context influences personality traits. Future efforts could
   separate whether personality traits differ in heritability because they
   have served specific functional roles in the evolution of the phenotype
   or because our concept of personality and the stability of behaviour
   needs to be revised.}},

Title = {{Intraindividual Behavioral Variability Predicts Foraging Outcome in a
   Beach-dwelling Jumping Spider}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent differences between
   individuals in behavior, has been the subject of hundreds if not
   thousands of papers. However, little work explores the fitness
   consequences of variation in behavior within individuals, or
   intraindividual variability (IIV). We probe the effects of behavioral
   IIV on predator-prey interaction outcomes in beach-dwelling jumping
   spiders (Terralonus californicus). Prior studies have found that spiders
   with higher body condition (body mass relative to size) behave more
   variably. Thus, we hypothesized that jumping spider activity level IIV
   would relate positively to foraging performance. To address this, we
   tested for associations between activity IIV, average activity level,
   and two measures of foraging success in laboratory mesocosms: change in
   spider mass and the number of prey killed. Activity IIV positively
   correlated with the mass that spiders gained from prey, but not with the
   number of prey killed. This suggests that spiders with high IIV consumed
   a greater proportion of their prey or used less energy. Interestingly,
   average activity level (personality) predicted neither metric of
   foraging success, indicating that behavioral IIV can predict metrics of
   success that personality does not. Therefore, our findings suggest that
   IIV should be considered alongside personality in studies of
   predator-prey interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Learning is a change in state resulting from new experiences enabling
   behavioural responses to be adjusted in alignment with external cues.
   Individuals differ in the speed and accuracy at which they learn.
   Personality has been postulated as being a major influence on learning
   ability in terms of attention and encounter rates of environmental cues.
   This link forms the basis of the cognitive style hypothesis (CSH),
   predicting that an individual's cognitive style will occur along a
   fast-slow behavioural gradient. Fast types are characterised as being
   active, neophilic, and bold individuals who sample their environment
   rapidly, yet superficially, enabling learning to occur at a higher
   speed, but at the cost of accuracy. Slow types have the opposite suite
   of personality traits resulting in them being more accurate flexible
   learners. Greater level of learning flexibility is thought to help
   promote invasions success. Here, we test the predictions of the CSH in
   an invasive lizard (Lampropholis delicata) to determine if personality
   dictates learning performance in a two-phase associative task. Results
   indicated that the delicate skink was capable of learning an associative
   task but only provided partial support for the CSH. Personality was
   found to influence learning accuracy, however, the direction of that
   relationship was opposite to that predicted. Instead, fast lizards made
   fewer mistakes when learning to associate a colour to a goal. These
   findings highlight the need to further investigate the CSH across taxa
   and consider its potential as an underlying mechanism of the invasion
   process.}},

Title = {{Smaller and bolder prey snails have higher survival in staged encounters

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{633-638}},

Abstract = {{Temporally consistent individual differences in behavior, also known as
   animal personality, can have large impacts on individual fitness. Here,
   we explore the degree to which individual differences in anti-predator
   response (or boldness) influence survival rates in groups of snails
   Chlorostoma funebralis when they encounter a predatory sea star Pisaster
   giganteus. The snail C. funebralis shows consistent individual variation
   in predator response where some fearful snails actively flee bodies of
   water occupied by predators whereas bolder snails consistently do not.
   We show here that bold snails are significantly more likely to survive
   encounters with a predatory sea star and, somewhat counterintuitively,
   fearful snails actually suffer higher mortality rates. We also found
   that smaller snails and those occurring at higher experimental densities
   experienced higher per capita survival rates. Positive effects of prey
   boldness on survival are not uncommonly reported in the animal
   personality literature; however, such results are inconsistent with
   classic animal personality theory borrowed from the optimal foraging
   literature. The findings herein add to the growing body of evidence that
   consistent individual differences in behavior can impact predator-prey
   interactions and that boldness is potentially under positive
   predator-driven selection in some systems.}},

Title = {{Uncontrollable chronic stress reduces growth disparities in farmed
   Atlantic salmon}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{246-252}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Individual variation in behavior and physiological traits in a wide
   variety of animals has been the focus of numerous studies in recent
   years. In this context, early life experiences shape responses that
   individuals have to subsequent environments, i.e. developmental
   plasticity. In this experiment, we subjected 10-month old fish to an
   unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) regime or no stress (control) for 3
   weeks. These individuals then underwent the parr-smolt transformation,
   when salmonids become adapted for the seawater environment, and were
   subsequently transferred into seawater before the final sampling.
   Biometric data was collected at the end of each period. Sampling on the
   final day was conducted in order to analyze basal monoaminergic activity
   in the brain stem and hypothalamus, as well as gene expression of target
   genes in the telencephalon. We found that post-hoc sorting of
   individuals by their serotonergic activity (high and low) resulted in
   the elucidation of growth and gene expression differences. UCS groups
   were found to have less growth disparities throughout the experiment,
   compared to control fish. Furthermore, we found brain serotonergic
   signaling and corticotropic releasing factor binding protein expression
   were positively associated with brain stem serotonergic activity, which
   is consistent with fish showing a stress reactivity neurophysiological
   profile. In conclusion, we here submit evidence that sorting individuals
   by their basal serotonergic activity levels may be a useful tool in the
   study of developmental plasticity. These results may thus apply directly
   to improving husbandry practices in aquaculture and elucidating neural
   mechanisms for coping behavior.}},

Title = {{Chronic social defeat induces long-term behavioral depression of
   aggressive motivation in an invertebrate model system}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Losing a fight against a conspecific male (social defeat) induces a
   period of suppressed aggressiveness and general behaviour, often with
   symptoms common to human psychiatric disorders. Agonistic experience is
   also discussed as a potential cause of consistent, behavioral
   differences between individuals (animal ``personality{''}). In
   non-mammals, however, the impact of single agonistic encounters
   typically last only hours, but then again studies of repeated
   intermittent defeat (chronic social defeat) are seldom. We report the
   effect of chronic social defeat in adult male crickets (Gryllus
   bimaculatus), for which all known behavioral effects of defeat last only
   3 h. Firstly, after 48 h social isolation, crickets that experienced 5
   defeats at 24 h intervals against the same, weight-matched opponent
   exhibited suppressed aggressiveness lasting > 24 h, which was still
   evident when the animals were matched against an unfamiliar opponent at
   the last trial. Secondly, this longer-term depression of aggression also
   occurred in 48 h isolated crickets that lost 6 fights at 1 h intervals
   against unfamiliar opponents at each trial. Thirdly, crickets isolated
   as larvae until adult maturity (> 16 days) were significantly more
   aggressive, and less variable in their aggressiveness at their very
   first fight than 48 h isolates, and also significantly more resilient to
   the effects of chronic social defeat. We conclude that losing an
   aggressive encounter in crickets has a residual effect, lasting at least
   24 h, that accumulates when repeated defeats are experienced, and leads
   to a prolonged depression of aggressive motivation in subordinates.
   Furthermore, our data indicate that social interactions between young
   adults and possibly larvae can have even longer, possibly lifelong
   influences on subsequent behavior. Social subjugation is thus likely to
   be a prime determinant of inter-individual behavioral differences in
   crickets. Our work also opens new avenues for investigating proximate
   mechanisms underlying depression-like phenomena.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{84-90}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Work on the repeatability of reproductive behaviour has mainly focused
   on the consistency of female preferences. We characterised the
   consistency of individual male Drosophila melanogaster reproductive
   behaviour in two experiments. In the first experiment, we allowed males
   to interact with a pair of live females that differed in body size. We
   then controlled female behaviour in a second experiment by examining the
   courtship behaviour of individual males interacting with a pair of
   decapitated females that varied in body size. In both experiments, we
   examined the consistency of individual male reproductive behaviour
   across two repeated trials on the same day. Males did not exhibit a
   courtship preference for the larger female in either experiment, but, in
   experiment 1, males did exhibit post-copulatory choice by copulating for
   longer durations with the large female, and males that mated with the
   same type of female in both trials exhibited repeatable behaviour. In
   general, we found weak evidence of consistent male courtship behaviour
   in the presence of behaving females. However, when female behaviour was
   controlled in experiment 2, we found that male courtship behaviour was
   highly repeatable. These results indicate that individual male D.
   melanogaster exhibit consistent reproductive behaviour and demonstrate
   the importance of controlling female behaviour when attempting to
   characterise the repeatability of male reproductive behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{An animal's life history, physiology, and behaviour can be shaped by
   selection in a manner that favours strong associations among these
   aspects of an integrated phenotype. Recent work combining animal
   personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster
   life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive
   rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels
   relative to those with slower life history strategies, but empirical
   tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter
   snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history
   strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick
   rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a
   measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly
   positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials.
   Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence
   of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of
   activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors,
   such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select
   for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to
   facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges. Thus, we offer
   evidence that behaviour is an important component of co-evolved suites
   of traits forming a general pace -of-life continuum in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have evaluated whether habitat disturbance affects
   behavioral consistency and plasticity. We measured shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance for the first time in naked-footed mice
   (Peromyscus nudipes) in two adjacent habitats with differing level of
   disturbance in Costa Rica. Each habitat was measured in different,
   consecutive years. With these data, we explored the possibility of
   habitat differences in individual- and population-level behavioral
   plasticity, magnitude of behavior, and consistency. Mice in both
   habitats behaved consistently across time with high repeatability (i.e.,
   showed personality). The strength of consistency of shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance over time was higher in the disturbed habitat, and
   individuals in the undisturbed habitat were bolder and less exploratory.
   Behaviors were correlated with each other in both habitats, indicating
   that behavioral syndromes do not always break down in disturbed areas.
   Mice changed the magnitude of their response the second time they were
   tested, indicating population-level plasticity. There was also greater
   individual plasticity among mice in the undisturbed habitat. Our study
   suggests the possibility that habitat disturbance can affect behavioral
   plasticity and personality and that shyer/more exploratory individuals
   might colonize and/or persist in disturbed habitats. These results are
   preliminary and exploratory because we did not control for temporal
   differences between habitats.}},

Abstract = {{One of the triumphs of evolutionary biology is the discovery of robust
   mechanisms that promote the evolution of cooperative behaviors even when
   cooperation reduces the fertility or survival of cooperators. These
   mechanisms include, kin selection, reciprocity, and direct benefits to
   cooperation that are often nonlinear. Though they have been extensively
   studied separately, investigating the joint action of these mechanisms
   has been more difficult. Moreover, how these mechanisms shape variation
   in cooperation is not well known. Such variation is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of behavioral syndromes and animal
   personality. Here, I use the tools of kin selection and evolutionary
   game theory to build a framework that integrates these mechanisms for
   pairwise social interactions. Using relatedness as a measure of the
   strength of kin selection, responsiveness as a measure of reciprocity,
   and synergy as a measure of payoff nonlinearity, I show how different
   combinations of these three parameters produce directional selection for
   or against cooperation or variation in levels of cooperation via
   stabilizing or diversifying selection. Moreover, each of these outcomes
   maps uniquely to one of four classic games from evolutionary game
   theory, which means that modulating relatedness, responsiveness, and
   synergy effectively transforms the payoff matrix from one the
   evolutionary game to another. Assuming that cooperation exacts a
   fertility cost on cooperators and provides a fertility benefit to social
   partners, a prisoner's dilemma game and directional selection against
   cooperation occur when relatedness and responsiveness are low and
   synergy is not too positive. Enough positive synergy in these conditions
   generates a stag-hunt game and diversifying selection. High levels of
   relatedness or responsiveness turn cooperation from a fitness cost into
   a fitness benefit, which produces a mutualism game and directional
   selection for cooperation when synergy is not too negative. Sufficiently
   negative synergy in this case creates a hawk-dove game and stabilizing
   selection for cooperation. I extend the results with relatedness and
   synergy to social groups and show that how group size changes the effect
   of relatedness and synergy on selection for cooperation depends on how
   the per capita benefit of cooperation changes with group size. Together,
   these results provide a general framework with which to generate
   comparative predictions that can be tested using quantitative genetic
   techniques and experimental techniques that manipulate investment in
   cooperation. These predictions will help us understand both
   interspecific variation in cooperation as well as within-population and
   within-group variation in cooperation related to behavioral syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting a quality mate can involve acquiring and accessing large
   amounts of information; information that can be obtained either
   independently or socially. One means of learning about mates socially is
   to attend to other members of one's sex and copy their mate choices. It
   is possible however that not all individuals of a species benefit
   equally from, or are equally effective at, copying. We examined whether
   female guppies copied the mate choices of other females. Then, in a
   separate context we measured each female's `sociability': their
   proclivity to affiliate with other guppies. In the mate-choice copying
   procedure, `focal' females chose to spend time near two putative mates.
   Next, focals observed another (model) female interact with the focal's
   non-preferred male. Finally, the focal again chose between the same two
   males. For sociability, we examined the time focal females spent near a
   trio of other guppies. Females did indeed mate copy: they spent more
   time with their non-preferred male when a model female had been seen
   interacting with that male. The effect however was highly variable.
   Sociability significantly predicted the intensity of mate-choice
   copying. Results suggest that individuals vary consistently in the types
   of information they use when making mating decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) hiding time depends on individual and
   state}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{The decisions animals make to adjust their antipredator behavior to
   rapidly changing conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses
   in plants are an antipredator behavior that acts on a longer time scale,
   but sensitive plants, Mimosa pudica, have a much more rapid antipredator
   response; they temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time
   they remain closed is defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in
   sensitive plants and found that individual plants differed significantly
   in their hiding times. We then showed that the effect of individual
   explained substantial variation in hiding time on a short time scale.
   Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality persisted but the amount
   of variation attributed to individual decreased. We hypothesized that
   variation in plant condition might explain this change. We therefore
   manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time. When
   deprived of light for 6 h, sensitive plants significantly shortened
   their hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light,
   hiding times on the deprived half and light exposed half were not
   significantly different. This suggests that overall condition best
   explains variation in sensitive plant antipredator behavior. Just like
   in animals, sensitive plant antipredator behavior is condition
   dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial amount of the
   remaining variation is explained by individual differences between
   plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior
   may be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms,
   including plants.}},

Title = {{To be so bold: boldness is repeatable and related to within individual
   behavioural variability in North Island robins}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{144-149}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural research traditionally focusses on the mean responses of a
   group of individuals rather than variation in behaviour around the mean
   or among individuals. However, examining the variation in behaviour
   among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the
   evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most
   commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural
   research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations
   that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual
   variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of
   within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be
   important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of
   conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of
   the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this
   experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island
   robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and
   examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk),
   (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant
   relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found
   that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV
   in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness
   and IN in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of
   repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant
   differences in IIV among different individuals within the population.
   Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IW in their
   boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces
   behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results
   definitively demonstrate that IN itself varies across individuals and is
   linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of
   future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for
   behavioural interactions.}},

Title = {{An experimental test of state-behaviour feedbacks: gizzard mass and
   foraging behaviour in red knots}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1111-1121}},

Abstract = {{1. Animals frequently exhibit consistent among-individual differences in
   behavioural and physiological traits that are inherently flexible. Why
   should individuals differ consistently in their expression of labile
   traits? Recently, positive feedbacks between state and behaviour have
   been proposed as a possible explanation for the maintenance of
   consistent among-individual differences in both state and behaviour. If
   state affects behaviour, and behaviour reciprocally affects state, then
   differences in either state or behaviour that arise among individuals
   even by chance could be maintained over extended periods of time.
   2. We tested for positive feedbacks experimentally using wild-caught red
   knots (Calidris canutus islandica). In the wild, knots exhibit
   consistent among-individual differences in digestive physiology (the
   mass of the muscular part of the stomach, the gizzard) and foraging
   behaviour (diet), two inherently labile traits.
   3. Experimentally manipulated diet quality had a large effect on gizzard
   mass. Experimentally manipulated gizzard mass reciprocally influenced
   total food eaten during adlibitum trials.
   4. The effect of gizzard mass on diet choice, though in the predicted
   direction, was not statistically significant. Individuals exhibited
   consistent differences in foraging behaviour of unknown origin
   independent of current gizzard mass, as well as large residual
   unexplained variance in foraging behaviour. These two sources of
   variation in foraging behaviour overruled the gizzard mass-dependent
   foraging behaviour and hence eroded the treatment-related differences in
   gizzard mass.
   5. We conclude that positive feedbacks between diet choice and gizzard
   mass play at best a limited role in maintaining among-individual
   variation in gizzard mass in red knots. Furthermore, we suggest that
   many models of state-behaviour feedbacks likely overestimate their
   potential importance in maintaining long-term among-individual variation
   in labile traits because most models of state-behaviour feedbacks fail
   to account for the effects of additional factors that may act to disrupt
   the feedback loops.
   6. The among-individual differences in diet choice observed during
   solitary foraging trials eroded the consistent among-individual
   differences in gizzard mass observed following periods of staple diet
   treatments in which knots foraged in social groups. Social foraging
   interactions may play an important role determining the expression of
   foraging behaviours such as intake rate that in turn influence gizzard
   mass. Further studies are needed to experimentally test the role of
   social interactions as a mechanism generating consistent
   among-individual differences in foraging behaviours and gizzard mass.}},

   hoverflies}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many animals differ consistently in the way they behave across time and
   context. This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life
   history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the
   relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration.
   This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in
   which only part of a population migrates while the other remains
   resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and
   stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two
   partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva
   selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent
   behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within
   species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species.
   Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the
   phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and
   overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S.
   selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus.
   The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently
   across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between
   migratory and resident flies. They also provide evidence for the
   possible role of behavioural differences in influencing partial
   migration decisions within populations. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Abstract = {{There has been extensive game-theoretic modelling of conditions leading
   to equilibria of producer-scrounger dichotomies in groups. However there
   is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations.
   Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of
   birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a
   bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas,
   with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization
   persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory
   personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the
   foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to
   adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also
   important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher
   social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within
   subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and
   be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare
   example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger
   tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple
   scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the
   frequency of scroungers increases with group size.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{145-151}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Modern life history theory hypothesizes that pace of life is a strong
   predictor of life history traits. Recently, the notion that life history
   studies should integrate animal behaviour has emerged, because
   between-individual differences in behaviour are often coupled with
   fitness differences. So far, studies have mainly focused on interspecies
   or interpopulation perspectives, and research on the effects of life
   history differences on individual behaviour remain scarce. In the
   present study we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how pace of
   life is related to consistent individual behaviour. We investigated the
   relationship between developmental speed and consistent behaviour of the
   field wolf spider, Pardosa agrestis. In this species, individuals
   originating from the same clutch can typically follow either a slow or a
   rapid developmental pathway, characterized by a developmental time of
   about 10 or 3 months, respectively. We found that spiders, regardless of
   their developmental speed, behaved consistently in most of the tests.
   Our results also show that individuals developing rapidly were
   significantly more active during exploration and more successful in
   prey-catching tests than slowly developing spiders. Although rapidly
   developing spiders were bolder in one of the tests, this difference did
   not persist over the repeated measurements. Our work seems to support
   the notion that pace of life and animal personality are correlated, and
   pace of life might predict the behavioural types of individuals. (C)

Title = {{Important tools for Amazon Parrot reintroduction programs}},
Journal = {{REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Anti-predator behavior and personality have important consequences for
   the survival of captive-bred animals after reintroduction in the wild.
   The personality of an animal can be defined as low within-individual
   variation in behavior relative to between-individual variation in
   behavior. Mortality caused by predation is the main reason for
   reintroduction failure, and training captive-born animals to avoid
   predators can solve this problem. However, how anti-predator training
   affects the personality of animals is uncertain. The objective of this
   study was to test the behavioral responses of captive Amazon Parrots
   (Amazona aestiva, Psittacidae) submitted to an anti-predator
   conditioning protocol, and to evaluate if anti-predator training affects
   parrot personalities. Twenty-six parrots were trained against predators
   using taxidermized models; their personalities were evaluated by
   calculating boldness scores before and after anti-predator training
   sessions. Parrots increased the expression of anti-predator behaviors
   when tested with all models; control groups behaved in a more relaxed
   way. The anti-predator responses persisted for 60 days after the end of
   the training sessions. Boldness scores increased in 50\% of cases after
   anti-predator training sessions, and in only 33\% of cases did parrots
   become shyer after anti-predator training. The tendency of parrots to
   exhibit bold behaviors in the personality tests, even after the training
   sessions, may be explained by their early experiences, low behavioral
   plasticity or high cognitive ability. Training naive parrots was an
   effective tool to enhance behavioral responses against predators before
   reintroduction. The study of personality is of great importance in
   reintroduction and translocation programs to determine the position of
   each individual in the shy-bold continuum and to help select individuals
   more suited for reintroduction.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary theory predicts that when intrasexual competition is
   intense, risky behaviors can evolve if they enhance reproductive
   success. Here we tested the idea that polygynous males exhibit
   predictable variation in risk-taking during intense competition for
   mates. We conducted an observational study of a village weaverbird
   (Ploceus cucullatus) breeding colony, and video recorded synchronous
   fleeing events, a common predator avoidance behavior. Males adjusted
   their flight from the colony according to the amplitude (loudness) and
   Wiener entropy (harshness) of conspecific alarm calls during a perceived
   threat. Males also varied in how often they fled the colony.
   Specifically, in line with predictions based on the value of a male's
   territory, males with more nesting females were less likely to flee, and
   returned sooner if they did flee, compared to males with fewer nesting
   females. Males with a nest under construction also returned to their
   nests sooner than males without constructions in progress, consistent
   with predictions based on nest sabotage by conspecifics. These results
   suggest that male weavers perform a cost-benefit analysis in real time
   in order to decide how to respond to a perceived threat, with
   self-protection trading off with the security of one's territory and
   mates.}},

Journal = {{DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{237-244}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing interest, the behavioural ecology of deep-sea organisms
   is largely unknown. Much of this scarcity in knowledge can be attributed
   to deepwater animals being secretive or comparatively `rare', as well as
   technical difficulties associated with accessing such remote habitats.
   Here we tested whether two species of giant marine isopod (Bathynomus
   giganteus, Booralana tricarinata) captured from 653 to 875 m in the
   Caribbean Sea near Eleuthera, The Bahamas, exhibited an activity
   behavioural syndrome across two environmental contexts (presence/absence
   of food stimulus) and further whether this syndrome carried over
   consistently between sexes. We also measured routine metabolic rate and
   oxygen consumption in response to a food stimulus in B. giganteus to
   assess whether these variables are related to individual differences in
   personality. We found that both species show an activity syndrome across
   environmental contexts, but the underlying mechanistic basis of this
   syndrome, particularly in B. giganteus, is unclear. Contrary to our
   initial predictions, neither B. giganteus nor B. tricarinata showed any
   differences between mean expression of behavioural traits between sexes.
   Both sexes of B. tricarinata showed strong evidence of an activity
   syndrome underlying movement and foraging ecology, whereas only male B.
   giganteus showed evidence of an activity syndrome. Generally,
   individuals that were more active and bolder, in a standard open arena
   test were also more active when a food stimulus was present.
   Interestingly, individual differences in metabolism were not related to
   individual differences in behaviour based on present data. Our study
   provides the first measurements of behavioural syndromes and metabolism
   in giant deep-sea isopods.}},

Abstract = {{Although the field of animal personality research is growing,
   information on sea lion personality is lacking. This is surprising as
   sea lions are charismatic, cognitively advanced, and relatively
   accessible for research. In addition, their presence in captivity and
   frequent interactions with humans allow for them to be closely observed
   in various contexts. These interactions provide a valuable and unique
   opportunity to assess dimensions of their personality. This study
   created a personality survey for captive California sea lions (Zalophus
   californianus) using a 3-step approach that balances comprehensiveness
   and comparability to other species. Zookeepers (N = 43) at 5 zoological
   parks rated sea lions (N = 16) on 52 personality traits and 7 training
   traits. A principal components analysis and regularized exploratory
   factor analysis revealed 3 dimensions (Extraversion/Impulsivity,
   Dominance/Confidence, and Reactivity/Undependability). Each dimension
   was significantly correlated with at least 1 training trait. Pups and
   juveniles scored significantly higher on Extraversion/Impulsivity than
   adults. No other age or sex effects were present on this or any other
   dimension. Sea lions are cognitively complex marine mammals that
   represent a valuable addition to the group of species in which
   personality structure and function have been studied. The unique
   behavioral and ecological characteristics of sea lions offer another
   vantage point for understanding how personality varies between disparate
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Natural animal populations are increasingly exposed to human impacts on
   the environment, which could have consequences for their behaviour.
   Among these impacts is exposure to anthropogenic contaminants. Any
   environmental variable that influences internal state could impact
   behaviour across a number of levels: at the sample mean, at the level of
   among-individual differences in behaviour ('animal personality') and at
   the level of within-individual variation in behaviour (intra-individual
   variation, `IIV'). Here we examined the effect of exposure to
   seawater-borne copper on the startle response behaviour of European
   hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus across these levels. Copper exposure
   rapidly led to longer startle responses on average, but did not lead to
   any change in repeatability indicating that individual differences were
   present and equally consistent in the presence and absence of copper.
   There was no strong evidence that copper exposure led to changes in IIV.
   Our data show that exposure to copper for 1 week produces sample mean
   level changes in the behaviour of hermit crabs. However, there is no
   evidence that this exposure led to changes in repeatability through
   feedback loops.}},

Abstract = {{Using long-term maternal pedigree data, microsatellite analysis, and
   behavioral tests, we examined whether personality differences in wild
   Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) are associated with additive genetic
   effects, maternal influences, or belonging to a particular social group.
   Behaviors elicited by novel-object tests were defined by a component
   related to caution around novel-objects (Ob-PC1) and behaviors elicited
   by novel food-tests were defined by correlated components related to
   consummatory responses (Fo-PC1) and caution around novel foods (Fo-PC2).
   The repeatability of Ob-PC1 was modest and not significant; the
   repeatabilities of Fo-PC1 and Fo-PC2 were moderate and significant.
   Linear mixed effects models found that sex, age, sex x age,
   provisioning, trial number, date, time of day, season, and distance to
   the closest monkey were not related to personality. Linear mixed effects
   models of females older than 2 years found that high rank was associated
   with greater caution around novel objects. Linear models were used to
   determine whether sex, age, group membership, maternal kinship, or
   relatedness had independent effects on the personality similarity of
   dyads. These analyses found that pairs of macaques that lived in the
   same group were less similar in their caution around novel objects, more
   closely related pairs of macaques were more similar in their tendency to
   eat novel food, and that pairs of macaques in the same group were more
   similar in how cautious they were around novel foods. Together, these
   findings suggest that personality in this population of wild monkeys was
   driven by rank, genetic effects, and group effects, the latter possibly
   including the need to exploit different niches in the environment.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory measures of personality traits are often used to answer both
   evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations
   in the wild within and between populations. However, little is known
   about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with
   behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different
   context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour
   trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the
   activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different
   exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two
   different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test
   and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight
   large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of
   individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration.
   We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in
   activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found
   no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not
   capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or
   activity. We conclude that in our study population, the classic
   exploration behaviour test seems context specific, rather than
   constituting a general exploration strategy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In many animal taxa, behavior varies both among individuals (animal
   ``personalities{''}) and within individuals ({''}plasticity{''}).
   Personality and plasticity may co-vary if individuals differ in
   responsiveness to changes in their environment ({''}I x E{''}
   interaction). The nature and fitness implications of individual
   differences in behavioral plasticity in the wild are poorly understood.
   In territorial animals, fitness depends fundamentally on
   resource-defense behavior-their response to various threats from
   conspecific competitors. Such systems thus offer an ideal opportunity to
   investigate individual differences in behavioral plasticity. We used
   male superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) to test for individual
   differences in the intensity and plasticity of territorial defense
   behavior. Using captive assays, we identified behavioral types on the
   basis of fast versus slow exploration of a novel environment (the
   ``proactive-reactive{''} axis of behavior). Then we simulated
   territorial intrusions in the wild, using playback of experimentally
   manipulated songs that differed in trill length in a pair-wise design.
   Although previous work suggests that proactive individuals are more
   aggressive and less responsive than reactive individuals, we found no
   support for these differences in the context of territorial defense in
   the wild. Fast explorers (proactive) and slow explorers (reactive)
   responded equally aggressively to a simulated territorial intrusion
   overall. Furthermore, although fast explorers responded equally strongly
   to the two different playback stimuli, there was little evidence that
   slow explorers differentiated between the two stimuli, and this ``I x
   E{''} interaction was not statistically significant. Further work is
   needed to determine the prevalence in the wild of personality-related
   differences in behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in personality traits should be
   favoured when those traits contribute to consistent individual fitness
   differences. However, how variations in behaviours are related to
   productivity remains scarcely explored in social species, particularly
   in insects. Here, we investigated whether exploratory, boldness, and
   brood rescue behaviours expressed at the colony-level are associated
   with group productivity that is, colony growth, queen and worker
   production, and larvae survival in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster senilis.
   We found that group-level exploratory activity, boldness, and brood
   rescue efficiency were highly correlated. Furthermore, both exploratory
   activity and brood rescue efficiency were significantly consistent
   across 11 weeks. Finally, differences in brood rescue efficiency
   correlated positively with colony growth, queen and worker production,
   and larvae survival. These results show that colony-level personality
   may be linked with differences in colony life-history strategy, which
   may promote the emergence and maintenance of personality traits in
   group-living species.
   Significance statement
   When groups of individuals show variation in a series of behaviours that
   are related to exploratory activity and parental care, is it related to
   differences in groups' productivity? This is a key question to
   understand the process underlying the evolution and maintenance of
   consistent behavioural differences in a population. Here, we
   investigated whether exploratory, boldness, and brood rescue behaviours
   expressed at the colony-level are associated with group productivity
   that is, colony growth, queen and worker production, and larvae survival
   in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster senilis. Overall, this experiment reveals
   that behaviours in group-living species are linked with group
   productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The individual animal is currently a major focus of behavioural research
   and an increasing number of studies raise the question of how
   between-individual behavioural consistency and behavioural plasticity
   interact. Applying the reaction norm concept on groups, our study
   addresses both of these aspects in one framework and within an animal's
   natural social environment. Risk-taking behaviour in 1-year-old perch
   Perca fluviatilis was assayed in aquarium experiments before and after
   the fish were subjected to the presence or absence of a piscivorous
   predator for 3weeks. To analyse the inter-individual behavioural
   variation across the repeated measurements, we dissected the behavioural
   change across the predator treatment into individual constant and
   plastic components using hierarchical mixed-effects models. During the
   predator treatment, juvenile perch increased in boldness and decreased
   in vigilance, the magnitude of these behavioural changes was influenced
   by group composition. However, the behavioural changes were not
   influenced by the presence of a predator, indicating the difficulties in
   generating realistic long-term predation pressure in the laboratory.
   Individuals differed in the relative increase in boldness across the
   predator treatment and, thus, varied in the shape of their reaction
   norms. In accordance, the best linear unbiased predictors, extracted
   from the random effects of separate linear mixed-effects models for the
   data before and after the predator treatment were only weakly
   correlated. Hence, between-individual variation seems to change under
   laboratory conditions and therewith not necessarily represents the
   initially present natural' variation, giving important implications for
   the conduction and interpretation of behavioural experiments.}},

Title = {{Geometrical envelopes: Extending graphical contemporary niche theory to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{271-289}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary niche theory is a powerful structuring framework in
   theoretical ecology. First developed in the context of resource
   competition, it has been extended to encompass other types of regulating
   factors such as shared predators, parasites or inhibitors. A central
   component of contemporary niche theory is a graphical approach
   popularized by Tilman that illustrates the different outcomes of
   competition along environmental gradients, like coexistence and
   competitive exclusion. These food web modules have been used to address
   species sorting in community ecology, as well as adaptation and
   coexistence on eco-evolutionary time scales in adaptive dynamics. Yet,
   the associated graphical approach has been underused so far in the
   evolutionary context. In this paper, we provide a rigorous approach to
   extend this graphical method to a continuum of interacting strategies,
   using the geometrical concept of the envelope. Not only does this
   approach provide community and eco-evolutionary bifurcation diagrams
   along environmental gradients, it also sheds light on the similarities
   and differences between those two perspectives. Adaptive dynamics
   naturally merges with this ecological framework, with a close
   correspondence between the classification of singular strategies and the
   geometrical properties of the envelope. Finally, this approach provides
   an integrative tool to study adaptation between levels of organization,
   from the individual to the ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Behavioral differences between native and introduced species may
   contribute to the invasiveness of certain species. This includes
   differences at the species level, consistent variation among individuals
   ({''}personality{''}) and within-individual variation (e.g., behavioral
   plasticity). Here, we investigated swimming activity of individuals from
   four different amphipod species occurring in the river Rhine system,
   three of which were native or naturalized (> 100 years present) while
   one is a recent invader (Dikerogammarus villosus, < 25 years present).
   At the species level, D. villosus did not show higher average swimming
   activity than the three non-invasive species. However, the non-invasive
   species, on average, changed their behavior predictably over the course
   of the experiment ({''}average behavioral plasticity{''}), while D.
   villosus did not exhibit any consistent change in activity. At the
   individual level, D. villosus exhibited greater among- and
   within-individual variation in activity levels than all non-invasive
   species. The non-invasive species further showed significant individual
   differences in plasticity, that is, individuals of these species
   differed consistently in how they changed their activity over time. The
   high within-individual variation in D. villosus translated into a lack
   of consistent individual differences in plasticity in this species. We
   hypothesize that the highly variable and unpredictable patterns of
   individual activity variation in D. villosus might help this successful
   invader to cope with new environmental conditions encountered in the

Abstract = {{An animal's personality may be an adaptive behavioral response of
   individuals to consistent differences in physiology and life-history.
   Studying the relationship between behavior and other fitness-related
   traits within the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) framework, which explains
   the integration of different traits using the concept of a fast-slow
   life-history continuum, may thus be a useful approach to understanding
   the evolution and maintenance of animal personality. According to the
   POLS hypothesis, for example, fast individuals should be behaviorally
   more active, bolder or less sociable, and potentially invest more in
   reproduction than slow individuals. Here, we examined whether the
   sociability of juvenile sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is linked
   with their key reproductive traits, carotenoid-based nuptial coloration
   of males and egg production of females. We also tested whether
   experimental manipulation of environmental conditions (control vs. warm
   winter) can change pace-of-life and the link between behavioral and
   reproductive traits. Male sticklebacks prone to shoaling expressed lower
   peak red coloration at the reproductive stage, during which they were
   solitary and territorial. In females, fecundity was not correlated with
   early social behavior. Experimental sticklebacks reared in warm winter
   conditions decreased their investment in reproduction, but the negative
   relationship between sociability and sexual signal of males was
   maintained. Our results suggest that the POLS could partly explain the
   maintenance of personality under predation pressure or severe mating
   competition. In natural environments, any benefit to sociable male
   sticklebacks may be counterbalanced by the cost of growing less
   attractive.
   Why do animals vary in personality, and how is such variation maintained
   within a population? An interesting approach for understanding this is
   studying how personality traits are correlated with other
   fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life framework. For the first
   time, our results show the link between sociability at the juvenile
   stage and the expression of sexual ornament during reproduction in male
   three-spined sticklebacks. Sociable juveniles may benefit from reduced
   predation risk, but they grow less attractive and this may reduce their
   mating success during reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between survival
   and reproduction may contribute to the maintenance of among-individual
   variation in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative mating behaviour, personality traits and morphological
   characters are predicted to be correlated. Bolder, larger and more
   colourful males are expected to preferentially court females, while shy,
   small and drab-coloured individuals are predicted to sneak copulations.
   We used males of Endler's guppy, Poecilia wingei, to test this
   association over a long temporal period (hence including ontogenetic
   changes) and under two social environments (male-biased and
   female-biased). We found that personality traits (exploration, boldness,
   activity) of P.wingei males were highly repeatable across long time
   spans, but they were not correlated (formed no behavioural syndrome).
   Male age and social environment had no effect on any personality trait,
   despite their effects on alternative mating behaviour. Young males with
   higher activity levels were more likely to attempt sneaking. In older
   fish, there was an association between orange coloration, courtship and
   boldness, but this was not observed in young males. Our results suggest
   that alternative mating behaviour is more flexible than personality
   traits and is independent of them. Non-colour-based morphological traits
   (gonopodium length, body length, caudal straps length, dorsal fin
   length) were not correlated with any particular mating behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Behavior varies among individuals and is flexible within individuals.
   However, studies of behavioral syndromes and animal personality have
   demonstrated that animals can show consistency in their behavior and as
   such may be restricted in their behavioral responses. Like any other
   trait, including morphology, performance, or physiology, personality is
   now considered an important component of ecology and may have fitness
   consequences. Moreover, in some species personality correlates with
   other traits, as predicted in the context of a recent theoretical
   framework postulating that individual differences in growth and body
   size can affect behavior through effects on growth-mortality tradeoffs.
   This ``pace of life{''} hypothesis predicts that animals that explore
   more should be larger and have higher growth rates than those that
   explore less. We tested for associations between morphology and a
   behavioral trait in a captive colony of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus). We used open-field tests to evaluate exploration behavior and
   measured a series of morphological traits in 72 individuals (32 males
   and 40 females). Our results show that the latency to start exploring
   correlates positively with adult body size and body weight at birth.
   These data provide evidence for a link between morphology and behavior
   in this species, thus supporting predictions of dispersal models but
   diverging from the predictions of the ``pace of life{''} model.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent inter-individual behavioral differences in animals, or animal
   personalities, are increasingly recognized as an important component of
   sexual selection. Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated
   effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the
   link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in
   species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the
   non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality
   traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated
   effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model
   species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using
   competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability
   to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting
   sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female
   choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus
   independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals
   better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning
   decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male
   competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent
   between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males
   with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits
   of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition
   in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas
   female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of
   male personality.
   Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species
   with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish
   where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until
   hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits
   promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted
   nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality
   had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating
   preferences. Instead, females agreed remarkably well in their mating
   decisions and consistently favored large males with elaborate nests. Our
   results show that male personality is important for nest allocation,
   which is crucial in environments where nesting sites are rare.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness reflects consistent individual differences in risk-taking
   behavior across various contexts. However, evaluating this basic
   assumption has largely been neglected in birds. In a captive monk
   parakeet population (Myiopsitta monachus; N = 33), we undertook an
   analysis of 7 measures across 3 commonly used boldness assays (i.e.,
   novel object, emergence, and predator-exposure tests). Using principal
   component analysis, we derived 3 components (PCs). PC-2 loaded strongly
   with measures from emergence and predator-exposure tests; we interpreted
   it as the closest approximation of boldness. PC-1 and PC-3 described
   different aspects of feeding such as foraging activity and rate,
   respectively. Finally, we assessed the predictive power of each measure
   that loaded significantly on the boldness axis. We found that no single
   metric explained even \%55 of the variation in PC-2, nor could more than
   \% 50 individuals at the extremes of the spectrum be predicted. Our
   results demonstrate the utility of an inclusive approach in personality
   research.}},

Title = {{Effective field-based methods to quantify personality in brushtail

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{332-340}},
Abstract = {{Context There is growing recognition of the importance of animal
   personality in wildlife ecology and management. Individuals that differ
   consistently in their behaviours from others of the same population are
   considered to exhibit different personalities. Personality can be easily
   quantified with repeat tests on animals held in captivity. However,
   captive-based tests may not always be possible for logistical reasons
   and tests conducted in captivity can alter naturally occurring
   behaviours. Development of methods to assess personality in the field
   over short-term capture is an important alternative to long-term captive
   tests.
   Aims To develop and refine field-based tests that can be used to easily
   define personality traits of wild common brushtail possum (Trichosurus
   vulpecula), eliminating the need to bring individuals into captivity for
   an extended period of time.
   Methods We developed a series of short-term capture protocols to
   quantify personality traits of the common brushtail possum in the field,
   using handling-bag tests, modified open-field tests, trap-behaviour
   tests and release tests.
   Key results Personality traits of brushtail possums could be measured in
   several different ways, but refining methods was crucial to reveal
   traits efficiently. Behaviours related to several personality traits
   (boldness, docility and activity/exploration) could be measured rapidly
   in the field with our methods, and were repeatable over time.
   Conclusions Rapid, reliable and easy-to-perform quantification of
   personality of brushtail possums in the field is possible. This may
   sometimes be the only available option, and has advantages over long
   captive trials in terms of animal welfare and cost.
   Implications The present study provides a baseline for future research
   on the personality of common brushtail possums and its application to
   management and control strategies for the species.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-individual differences in behaviour, termed `animal personality',
   are often consistent over time and across contexts and can be
   significantly related to fitness. However, most studies of animal
   personality are conducted in the laboratory or involve experimental
   protocols. Here, we used longitudinal scan and all-occurrence data
   collected under naturalistic conditions over 21 years to study boldness,
   aggressiveness, and sociability in a wild population of spotted hyenas
   (Crocuta crocuta). We found significant variation among individual
   hyenas in all three traits; however, whereas both sexes exhibited
   consistent inter-individual differences in aggressiveness and
   sociability, males were less consistent than females in their boldness.
   Heritability and maternal effects were small but significant for both
   boldness and sociability. A large proportion of the variation in
   aggressiveness could be attributed to genetic and maternal effects,
   supporting previous research linking hormone exposure in utero to
   aggressive behaviour later in life. All three traits were correlated
   with at least one measure of fitness. Particularly aggressive females
   were more successful in raising their offspring to reproductive maturity
   than less aggressive females. Interestingly, the reproductive benefits
   of sociability depended on social rank; for low-ranking hyenas, gaining
   feeding tolerance via sociability may significantly enhance reproductive
   success. Both boldness and sociability were linked to survival, but
   these traits affected longevity in different ways; highly social hyenas
   lived longer than those that were less social, but selection on boldness
   was stabilizing, favoring hyenas with intermediate boldness values that
   balance the benefits of risky behaviour against risks of injury and
   death.}},

Title = {{Integrating molecular mechanisms into quantitative genetics to
   understand consistent individual differences in behavior}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{111-114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is now well appreciated that individual animals behave differently
   from one another and that individual differences in behaviors -
   personality differences - are maintained through time and across
   situations. Quantitative genetics has emerged as a conceptual basis for
   understanding the key ingredients of personality: (co) variation and
   plasticity. However, the results from quantitative genetic analyses are
   often divorced from underlying molecular or other proximate mechanisms.
   This disconnect has the potential to impede an integrated understanding
   of behavior and is a disconnect present throughout evolutionary ecology.
   Here we discuss some of the main conceptual connections between
   personality and quantitative genetics, the relationship of both with
   genomic tools, and areas that require integration. With its
   consideration of both trait variation and plasticity, the study of
   animal personality offers new opportunities to incorporate molecular
   mechanisms into both the trait partitioning and reaction norm frameworks
   provided by quantitative genetics.}},

Title = {{Testing the Effects of Biogenic Amines and Alternative Topical Solvent
   Types on the Behavioral Repertoire of Two Web-Building Spiders}},

Abstract = {{Investigating the proximate mechanism underlying behavior has long been
   a primary goal of ethologists. With the recent focus on behavioral
   correlations (e.g., behavioral syndromes), a fundamental question arises
   regarding what mechanisms may drive positive relationships between
   functionally distinct behaviors. Understanding these mechanisms can
   inform critical questions, such as why distinct behaviors are often
   correlated, and can also lend insights into how behavioral similarities
   are conserved across species. Arthropods provide an idea system to study
   these questions as the biogenic amines, such as octopamine and
   serotonin, have long been known to mediate a large number of behaviors
   such as aggression, dominance, escape behavior, and others. Behaviorists
   have several ways in which they can manipulate these biogenic amines
   invivo, including injection, feeding, and topical application. Topical
   application is potentially an optimal method for manipulating amine
   concentrations, given that it is minimally invasive and relatively
   precise. Here, we investigate the role of biogenic amines, octopamine,
   and serotonin, in mediating a range of similar and often correlated
   behaviors in two distantly related species of spiders, the western black
   widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the funnel-web spider, Agelenopsis
   pennsylvanica. Additionally, we investigate the behavioral effects
   associated with three commonly used carrier solvents: dimethylformamide
   (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetone. We demonstrate that
   biogenic amines are involved both in mediating several behaviors, and
   also potentially the links between different behaviors. We also show
   that the same behaviors in different species are not affected by
   biogenic amines in the same manner, suggesting differences in the
   underlying neurophysiological mechanisms governing behavior.
   Furthermore, we discovered large and pervasive effects associated with
   both carrier solvents, thus calling into question the potential
   usefulness and interpretability of topical application methods in
   behavioral research.}},
