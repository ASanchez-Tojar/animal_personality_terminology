X.ISI.000466289700004,"Plasticity, state-dependency, and individual consistency in Canada goose nest defense behavior","Clermont, Jeanne and Reale, Denis and Lindsay, Mari-Eve and Giroux, Jean-Francois",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,0340-5443,73,5,NA,2019,SPRINGER,10.1007/s00265-019-2681-0,"Animals are thought to adjust the intensity of their parental defense to fitness benefits associated with their current reproduction. They should be more defensive when they breed early in the season, when they produce more young, or as their young get older. Beyond these plastic changes, associations among traits could be explained by consistent among-individual differences. Separating the mechanisms at the origin of behavioral phenotypic variation is essential to understand the determinants and evolution of parental care. During four breeding seasons, we investigated whether variation in Canada goose (Branta canadensis) nest defense resulted from individual short-term plastic adjustments to reproductive stage within breeding seasons, plastic adjustments to brood value across breeding seasons, or from long-term among-individual differences. We thus estimated the among- and within-individual relationships between nest defense, clutch size, and laying date. Female and male nest defense behaviors were highly repeatable in time (R=0.72 and 0.67 on the short term). At the among-individual level, we found no significant association between female nest defense and life history traits, but the more defensive males were mated with the more fecund females. Female and male nest defense was not adjusted to annual variation in laying date nor in clutch size. However, females adjusted their nest defense within each breeding season and became more defensive when approaching egg hatching. Thus, Canada goose nest defense behavior is partly explained by plastic adjustments, but also by consistent among-individual differences which indicate the evolutionary potential of nest defense behavior.Significance statementAn association between traits at the phenotypic level can be partitioned into association at the among- and within-individual levels. This allows to better understand covariation of traits resulting from both among-individual differences and phenotypic plasticity. We observed 141 Canada goose pairs to identify what affected the intensity of their nest defense behavior. We found that geese were very consistent in their nest defense behavior and that female fecundity was related to male personality. Females also became more defensive as their young got older. Analyzing different sources of variation in parental behaviors enables a better understanding of their evolution. Our study also demonstrates the importance of studying nest defense in both sexes even in species where only females incubate eggs, as both sexes can invest in nest defense."

Here, I investigated the relationship between personality and microhabitat use in a free-living population of the clonal gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris. The study site is a small beachfront forest facing two environments with contrasting levels of human disturbance. I conducted a mark-recapture survey to assess the geckos' spacing pattern and evaluated their boldness and exploration scores in the laboratory. The geckos exhibited a small range of movement and a high consistency in their perch height. Boldness was related to two microhabitat features, but exploration was not. Relatively shy geckos were found in trees near the roadside and on low branches, whereas relatively bold geckos were found on both the beachside and the roadside and on low to high branches. These patterns suggest that geckos in high-disturbance microhabitats may have frequently experienced artificial stimuli and become shy. However, the present results cannot exclude the possibility that individual differences are caused by other factors and that different personality types prefer and settle in different microhabitats. Although the actual mechanisms are unclear, my findings highlight that behaviour-related habitat use emerges even in clonal animals.Significance statementIndividuals within conspecifics show different spacing patterns and different behavioural tendencies. If clonal animals live in a spatially diverse environment, it is predicted that different microhabitats may gradually shape different personality types through developmental plasticity. Here, I investigated the association between the personality of clonal geckos and their microhabitat use in different levels of human disturbance. In contrast to the prediction, both juveniles and adults showed a similar pattern of boldness-related microhabitats; relatively shy individuals were found in putatively high-disturbance sites. This result suggests that the association between boldness and microhabitats is not gradually formed through a long-time scale but is likely generated within their early ontogenetic stage."

In passerines, aggression during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care. This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice, they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality. We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further investigation.Significance statementMale songbirds, when attracting mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate. This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the breeding season does not carry information for females about what to expect from potential mates in terms of parental care."

Seed management by these animals has been traditionally approached at the population level: the patterns documented in the field are assumed to be similar for all individuals of the population and the variability within the population is considered to be random noise. However, little is known about to what extent this variability responds to different and consistent behaviours between individuals. The aim of this study was to analyse the individual variation and consistency in behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents within a population. As our model we used the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a key disperser of holm oak acorns, Quercus ilex, which, in turn, suffers high predation pressure by the common genet, Genetta genetta. In two sets of laboratory experiments, we compared the variance and consistency in behaviours and acorn management due to individual differences with that due to manipulation, using genet scents, of the perceived predation risk. Genet scents reduced the activity (i.e. time out of the refuge) in all wood mice, but the differences and consistency in activity between individuals accounted for most of the variance. Also, mice showed different and consistent stress or relaxed behaviours. Most of the variance in seed management variables, such as dispersal distance and seed size selection, was explained by consistent differences between individuals across scent treatments. The increase in stress behaviours and decrease in relaxed behaviours were positively related to dispersal ability (i.e. longer distances and larger acorns). Our study highlights the importance of considering the individual component of behaviour in scatter-hoarding rodents. This fine-scale level, largely overlooked in the ecological framework, will help to increase our understanding of seed management by scatter-hoarding animals.

Such a link can arise when traits under ecologically based selection are also used as cues for mating ('magic traits') or as a by-product of habitat choice when mating takes place within habitats. Here, we propose that behavioural syndromes may also constitute such a link. We illustrate this mechanism in the butter hamlet, Hypoplectrus unicolor, a reef fish from the wider Caribbean, with aggressive mimicry as the focal ecological trait. Aggressive mimicry is of particular interest in hamlets since it has been proposed to play a key role in the radiation of Hypoplectrus. Individuals from a natural population in Bocas del Toro, Panama, were tagged and their diurnal and spawning behaviours observed over 2 years. The results indicate that aggressive mimicry behaviour differed consistently between individuals and formed two discrete behavioural types that also differed with respect to territoriality. Differences in territoriality between the two behavioural types translated into different use of space in spawning contexts, which generated a tendency for assortative mating by behavioural type. This case study illustrates how behavioural syndromes may form a link between ecologically relevant behavioural traits and mate choice, suggesting that they might play an underappreciated role in the early stages of speciation.

M.",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,1045-2249,30,2,393-401,2019,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,10.1093/beheco/ary178,"A key goal in the study of animal personalities is to determine their adaptive potential and importance for behavioral evolution. Behavioral syndromes are evolutionarily intriguing because they suggest that an adaptive change in one behavior requires a concomitant shift in another. Within species, behavioral syndromes might be evolutionarily constrained by intrinsic mechanisms that restrict behaviors from evolving independently. Alternatively, behavioral correlations might easily be decoupled over short evolutionary time scales due to variation in selective pressures between environments. In this regard, comparative studies that explore differences in diverse aspects of personality between geographically distinct populations can provide valuable insights into the evolutionary processes acting on different behavioral tendencies. Accordingly, we investigated how behavioral types and behavioral syndromes differed across four geographically distinct populations of the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. We found strong evidence of mean trait-level variation in activity, exploration, and boldness across populations, suggesting adaptation to local environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that within-population correlations involving boldness varied substantially between populations. However, we did find a consistent within- and among-population correlation between activity and exploration, suggesting that this behavioral syndrome is relatively stable and could explain behavioral divergence in activity and exploration between populations. We suggest that there may be thermal physiological mechanisms that could be limiting the adaptive potential of an activity-exploration correlation in the delicate skink. Broadly, we argue that some behavioral correlations may be more adaptive than others, and that this should be more regularly considered within the animal personality framework."

Chadwick and Dornhaus, Anna",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,1045-2249,30,2,455-464,2019,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,10.1093/beheco/ary185,"Developmental plasticity is known to influence the mean behavioral phenotype of a population. Yet, studies on how developmental plasticity shapes patterns of variation within populations are comparatively rare and often focus on a subset of developmental cues (e.g., nutrition). One potentially important but understudied developmental experience is social experience, as it is explicitly hypothesized to increase variation among individuals as a way to promote social niches. To test this, we exposed juvenile black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) to the silk of conspecifics by transplanting them onto conspecific webs for 48 h once a week until adulthood. We also utilized an untouched control group as well as a disturbed group. This latter group was removed from their web at the same time points as the social treatment, but was immediately placed back on their own web. After repeatedly measuring adult behavior and web structure, we found that social rearing drove higher or significant levels of repeatability relative to the other treatments. Repeatability in the social treatment also decreased in some traits, paralleling the decreases observed in the disturbed treatments. Thus, repeated juvenile disturbance may decrease among-individual differences in adult spiders. Yet, social rearing appeared to override the effect of disturbance in some traits, suggesting a prioritization effect. The resulting individual differences were maintained over at least one-third of the adult lifespan and thus appear to represent stable, canalized developmental effects and not temporal state differences. These results provide proximate insight into how a broader range of developmental experiences shape trait variation."

Against this background, the overall idea of the present review is to transfer the personality concept from behavioural ecology to animal welfare science, to discuss the role of the individual in different research approaches and to pave new grounds for a more individual-tailored assessment and treatment of welfare-related problems. Moreover, we will explicitly refer to welfare issues ``beyond the average{''}, thereby addressing problems that are not entirely covered by simply studying personality traits in animal welfare research. By combining two different fields, we hope to stimulate more theoretical and empirical work on this topic to find new ways of improving the welfare of animals in human hands even at the individual level."

Personality types including boldness and aggression have been recently reported as important determinants of collective task performance, task specialisation and task proficiency in social spiders. These studies were performed in subadult and adult spiders and over the short term (3-15days). Therefore, the ontogeny of these personality types and its persistence over timescales relevant to the lifespan of any social spider species remains unknown. In the social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum, we investigated 1) if early instar juveniles exhibited consistent and repeatable personality types, 2) if personality types persisted over the long term in subadults and 3) if personality types are influenced by subadult body condition. Juveniles (3rd and 4th instars) showed consistent inter-individual differences and repeatability in boldness and aggression (across 21days). Subadults showed consistency in boldness and aggression over a duration of 51days, which covers a significant part of the subadult stage. However, repeatability of these traits declined over the long term. Moreover, boldness and aggression were not influenced by body condition (nutritional state) of subadults. Thus, we hypothesise that the early ontogeny of personality and its long-term persistence can influence behavioural propensities and task partitioning through later life stages in social spider colonies.Significance statementPersonalities have been demonstrated in a number of animal species. In animal societies, individuals with different personality types are known to engage in different activities within the group, leading to overall efficiency. Personalities have recently been shown to exist in social spiders. For example, aggressive spiders have a greater tendency to hunt prey than less aggressive individuals. However, for most animals, it remains unknown whether personality types manifest in very young individuals. Here, we show for the first time in social spiders that juveniles have personalities just as in adults. We also show that personality types persist over significant portions of individuals' life spans. These findings show that stable personality types can be important in collective tasks such as capturing prey."

In Nile tilapia, the thermosensitive period was reported from 10 to 30 days post fertilization. In their natural environment, juveniles may encounter high temperatures that are above the optimal temperature for growth (27-30 degrees C). The relevance of the thermal sex reversal mechanism in a natural context remains unclear. The main objective of our study is to determine whether sexually undifferentiated juveniles spontaneously prefer higher, unfavorable temperatures and whether this choice skews the sex ratio toward males. Five full-sib progenies (from 100\% XX crosses) were subjected to (1) a horizontal three-compartment thermal step gradient (thermal continuum 28 degrees C-32 degrees C-36.5 degrees C) during the thermosensitive period, (2) a control continuum (28 degrees C-28 degrees C-28 degrees C) and (3) a thermal control tank (36.5 degrees C). During the first days of the treatment, up to an average of 20\% of the population preferred the masculinizing compartment of the thermal continuum (36.5 degrees C) compared to the control continuum. During the second part of the treatment, juveniles preferred the lower, nonmasculinizing 32 degrees C temperature. This short exposure to higher temperatures was sufficient to significantly skew the sex ratio toward males, compared to congeners raised at 28 degrees C (from 5.0 +/- 6.7\% to 15.6 +/- 16.5\% of males). The proportion of males was significantly different in the thermal continuum, thermal control tank and control continuum, and it was positively correlated among populations. Our study shows for the first time that Nile tilapia juveniles can choose a masculinizing temperature during a short period of time. This preference is sufficient to induce sex reversal to males within a population. For the first time, behavior is reported as a potential player in the sex determination mechanism of this species."

Recently, it has been suggested that differences in the efficacy with which animals make a decision relate closely to individual behavioural differences. In this paper, we tested this hypothesis in a unique unicellular organism, the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We first confirmed that slime moulds differed consistently in their exploratory behaviour from `fast' to `slow' explorers. Second, we showed that slow explorers made more accurate decisions than fast explorers. Third, we demonstrated that slime moulds integrated food cues in time and achieved higher accuracy when sampling time was longer. Lastly, we showed that in a competition context, fast explorers excelled when a single food source was offered, while slow explorers excelled when two food sources varying in quality were offered. Our results revealed that individual differences in accuracy were partly driven by differences in exploratory behaviour. These findings support the hypothesis that decision-making abilities are associated with behavioural types, even in unicellular organisms."

We tested whether wild bat-eared foxes Otocyon megalotis differ in a risk-taking behavior (tameness) and whether this trait correlated with appetitive association learning performance. While our result shows that individuals differed in their tameness, we found no association between this personality trait and learning the appetitive association. This result does not support the framework that differences in cognition are associated with differences in personality; however, our small sample size does not allow us to assert that personality cannot be associated with cognition in this system. This study highlights that measuring cognition and personality in wild systems presents added difficulty and that correlations found in captive animals may not be evident in their wild counterparts."

For example, diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e. as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other traits, remains unclear. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design crossing life stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means or on the expression of an activity-antipredator response syndrome, suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during development also mediated the links between maturation time and exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life history and behavioural traits later in life.

However, behavioural plasticity in traits linked to reproduction has received surprisingly limited attention, especially in species exhibiting alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). In this study, we explored how behavioural plasticity in ARTs varies in response to social conditions in male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, an internally fertilizing fish in which males can switch between two ARTs to achieve matings. Males can either court receptive females using elaborate mating displays (courtship), or attempt forced copulations without prior display or female cooperation (sneaking). Although males have a genetic predisposition to engage predominantly in one tactic over the other, the extent to which social experience shapes individual plasticity in these tactics is unknown. We observed that between-individual variation in mating effort and preferred ARTs was repeatable over time and largely explained by variation in body size and coloration between individuals. Moreover, we showed experimentally that males exposed to social cues rapidly developed a preference towards either sneaking or courting, resulting in a rapid decline in individual plasticity compared to their socially deprived counterparts. These findings accord with the theoretical predictions that behavioural plasticity should decline as individuals incrementally adjust to local environmental conditions and, thus, when environmental uncertainty is reduced.

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild, free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest. Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency."

Scientific observations that support this view include the presence of individual differences in social behavior and that they are relatively stable throughout life. Consequently, individuals are constrained in their behavioral flexibility when dealing with various environmental challenges. Still, the variation among individuals during development suggests that the environment influences how primates behave. Research in fields including psychology, behavior genetics, and behavioral ecology have tried to identify the mechanisms responsible for this interplay of behavioral stability and change. In this review, we integrate theories and findings from research on humans and nonhuman primates that highlight how and to what extent genetic and environmental contributions shape the development of social behavior. To do so, we first provide an overview and define what is meant by mean-level and rank-order change of behavior. We then review explanations of behavioral stability and change, focusing on the role of genetic effects, how environmental circumstances influence behavioral variation throughout development, and how genetic and environmental influences may interact to produce this variation. Finally, we point to future research directions that could help us to further understand the development of social behavior in primates from within a behavior genetics framework."

In pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), naive dispersers (immigrants) had a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates compared with philopatric birds, but we found no difference in level of aggression. Males with more generalist diet fledged more young. This suggests that learning or early imprinting affects individual food and settlement choices and that dispersers adopt different life-history strategies. Abstract Dispersal is an essential process for most animal populations to persist in changing environments. Dispersers are often a nonrandom sample of the population, and differ consistently from nondispersers in a suite of correlated phenotypic traits (dispersal syndromes). This phenotypic integration is thought to be adaptive. Here, we investigate whether dispersal tendency of individual pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) covaries with a set of repeatable behaviors that should confer advantages for surviving and reproducing in novel environments. We specifically focus on the link between dispersal, foraging behavior, and aggressiveness because selection on foraging tactics or social behaviors likely differs between individuals staying in familiar or dispersing to novel environments. Using repeated measures of nestling provisioning data of pied flycatcher parents in 1 year, we tested if immigrants and philopatric individuals (local recruits and experienced breeders) differed in diet specialization, provisioning rates, levels of aggression, and reproductive success. Results show that individuals differed consistently in their foraging behavior, with immigrants having a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates than philopatric birds, but not in aggressiveness. More generalist males fledged more young. Our findings suggest that prior local knowledge facilitates diet specialization, and that more generalist diets could be adaptive for immigrants breeding in unknown environments. Aggressiveness was not part of the dispersal syndrome in our population, perhaps because high aggression levels are too costly to maintain in high density populations. Understanding the proximate causes and ultimate consequences of variation in dispersal syndromes requires now experimental manipulations of individual dispersal decisions."

Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is, however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46 adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness: diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed model revealed significant positive correlations between travel distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an activity-exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were uncorrelated with the activity-exploration syndrome and with each other, albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours. We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and human-wildlife coexistence.

These changes may relate to temperature regulation, torpor use, basal metabolic rate, body mass or behaviour, all acting in concert to ensure the best adjustment to the environmental challenges. As winter approaches, many small mammals develop a winter phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a summer one. However, there is a significant within-population polymorphism in winter phenotype. We hypothesized that winter phenotype is correlated with consistent between-individual differences in animal behaviour, i.e. animal personality, and energy metabolism. We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) and behavioural traits in three winter phenotypes of Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, which were acclimated to summer-like and then to winter-like conditions: fully responding, nonresponding and partially responding to a short photoperiod. We found no differences in behavioural traits between hamsters of different winter phenotypes, but the seasonal increase in activity was lowest in full responders indicating their lower behavioural flexibility than partial responders and nonresponders. The same was true for BMR. While nonresponders and partial responders increased their BMR from summer to winter, full responders did not change it. We argue that different winter phenotypes are maintained in the population because they could be beneficial under different environmental conditions. We also suggest that within a population there is a continuum of winter phenotypes, which is not related to differences in animal personalities. This continuum allows for population maintenance despite environmental conditions changing over short and long timescales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Research on animal personality has therefore received considerable attention, yet some methodological issues remain unresolved. We tested whether assessing personality by coding common behaviours is as time-consuming method as some researchers believe it to be. Altogether, 300 hours of observation were collected on 20 captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). We first examined the repeatability of behavioural indices that represented the behavioural repertoire of cotton-top tamarins. We then compared the personality structures, based on different lengths of observation time, of these behavioural indices. The minimum observational time necessary to obtain a stable personality structure was 5 to 7 hours per individual. This stable structure included two components: Extraversion and Confidence, which were similar to those described in great apes, Old World monkeys, and other New World monkeys. Our findings suggest that, at least in the case of cotton-top tamarins, behavioural coding over relatively short periods of time can be used to assess personality and that longer observation periods may yield diminishing returns."

We conducted laboratory experiments to analyze individual responses to different artificial conditions that could suit specific male and female personalities in the endangered seahorse, Hippocampus reidi. Our experiments with H. reidi evaluated individual responses to a new habitat, novel objects, level of inactivity and social interactions. We demonstrate that approximately half of the seahorses have a bold personality, readily inspecting new habitats and objects and sporadically presenting social approaches. The remaining shy individuals had high levels of inactivity and did not check novelties in their habitats. Although we expected that males would have shyer personalities when compared with females, due to their ecological role in the provision of parental care, we found no statistical difference between the sexes in terms of these aspects of personality. The similar frequency of both types of personality in males and females suggests that these features may be balanced and evolutionarily stable in the sampled population."

These individual differences are likely to have evolutionary and ecological significance, and it is therefore important to understand the precise nature of how environmental and physiological factors affect animal personalities. One factor which may affect personality is disease, but while the effects of disease on many aspects of host behaviour are well known, the effects on animal personalities have been little studied. Here we show that wood ants, Formica rufa, exhibit consistent individual differences in three personality traits: boldness, sociability and aggressiveness. However, experimental exposure to a virulent fungal parasite, Metarhizium pingshaense, had surprisingly little effect on the personality traits. Parasite-challenged ants showed marginal changes in sociability at high doses of parasite but no change in boldness or aggressiveness even when close to death. There was similarly little effect of other physiological stresses on ant personalities. The results suggest that individual personality in ants can be remarkably resilient to physiological stress, such as that caused by parasite infection. Future studies are needed to determine whether there is a similar resilience in solitary animals, as well as in other social species."

At the center of this new framework are behavioral syndromes or consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies. Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified the evolutionary mechanisms and ecological implications of behavioral syndromes. However, the persistence of behavioral syndromes over ontogeny remains an open question. Species with complex life cycles present an interesting system in which to test the persistence of behavioral syndromes, because such life histories are thought to evolve when correlations between life stages are costly. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that behavioral tendencies of species with complex life histories are consistent within a life stage (before or after metamorphosis) but not between life stages. We experimentally assayed the activity, boldness, and exploration of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) before and after metamorphosis. We found most behaviors to be at least moderately repeatable. Additionally, there was support for a behavioral syndrome within the larval stage as well as between larval behaviors and juvenile boldness. Our results reject the adaptive decoupling hypothesis and instead suggest that behavioral syndromes in species with complex life cycles can be maintained over metamorphosis.Significance statementA central prediction of behavioral syndromes is that individual behavioral consistency should be maintained over the life of an organism. However, in species with complex life cycles, evolution is thought to act independently on each stage, leading to the prediction that behavioral syndromes should not persist over metamorphosis. We tested for behavioral correlations over metamorphosis by assaying salamander activity, boldness, and exploration in larval and juvenile salamanders. We found support for behavioral syndromes within and between life stages. These findings contradict the predictions of complex life cycle evolution and instead suggest that behavioral syndromes may span metamorphosis. However, because support for the persistence of syndromes over metamorphosis varies between taxa, we caution researchers against extrapolating inferences from the larval stage to the juvenile stage."

Farmerfish (Stegastes nigricans) live in social groups and collectively defend gardens of palatable algae. These gardens also serve as settlement and nursery habitats for corals because farmerfish mob corallivores that attempt to forage on corals within these gardens. We detected large among-colony differences in farmerfish collective aggression towards intruder fish that persisted across years. We further found that the territories of aggressive groups and territories containing larger farmerfish provided greater protection to corals: territories of aggressive groups naturally harbored more branching corals than nonaggressive groups, and experimentally outplanted branching corals experienced 80\% less skeletal loss and grew larger over 25 weeks in aggressive territories than in nonaggressive territories. These findings hint that factors that increase farmerfish group aggressiveness (e.g., higher temperatures) could enhance the protective value of farmerfish territories for the replenishment of coral populations."

In particular, high exploratory tendencies and an ability to gather more information from the environment may facilitate adoption of novel ecological opportunities. As of yet, very few studies have examined if urbanization predicts the way in which animals explore novel environments, or the extent of among-individual variation within these habitats. Here, we assess exploration and its temporal plasticity in blackcapped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; N = 169 individuals, 14 sites) caught along an urban gradient to examine individual differences in exploration and changes in exploration over time and assays under a reaction-norm framework. As predicted, urban birds were significantly faster explorers in a novel environment (contacted more features and moved more), however urbanization did not predict individual differences in the change in exploration over time. Exploration score was moderately repeatable; interestingly, urban chickadees were more repeatable in their initial exploration behaviors, but seemed less repeatable in how they explored over time between assays in comparison to forest birds. Our results support the importance of high exploratory tendencies for urban animals, and suggest, for the first time, that individuals from urban and non-urban habitats differ in the amount of among-individual variation in exploration, and thus urban individuals may benefit from diverging more from one another in their behavior. Future work should examine the extent to which this variation in exploration and plasticity of exploration behaviors represent differences in how individuals gather information from their environment."

Such individual differences in ``personality{''} have been shown to be heritable, suggesting that selection maintains variation in personality. However, survival selection on a major personality trait, antipredator behavior, and its sex-dependency, has been seldom measured in the wild. Here, we found that yearling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) showed consistency in agitation upon repeated exposure to a restraint-handling protocol, probably reflecting antipredator behavior, and that males were more agitated than females. Females that exhibited larger antipredator behavior were more likely to survive until the next breeding season with no variation among 3 study years nor across 7 breeding colonies, suggesting that variation in antipredator behavior is not maintained by spatiotemporal variation in viability selection on antipredator behavior. In both sexes, the intensity of melanin-based ventral plumage coloration positively covaried with antipredator behavior, consistent with previous observations from diverse vertebrate species. In some barn swallow populations, male coloration is targeted by directional intersexual selection, suggesting that melanization signals antipredator behavior to prospecting females and that sexual selection for antipredator behavior, or other correlated personality traits, can drive the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in barn swallows. Thus, we showed that viability selection occurs on antipredator behavior and that spatiotemporal variation in selection has no major role in promoting variation in antipredator behavior. More melanized individuals were more agitated, implying that melanization may signal personality in a sexual communication context in a species where male coloration is an epigamic trait."

More recently, the hypothesis that such behavioral variation may also correlate to life-history traits, such as investment in current or future reproduction, has been proposed as a potential explanation for why variation is maintained among and within populations. A continual challenge in measuring the integration of these traits, or the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS), is to find a reliable and quantifiable proxy for energy allocation between reproduction and self-maintenance. Here, I address this challenge using the eusocial insects, Temnothorax ants, in a common garden experiment to directly quantify energy allocation by tracking the number of sterile workers (somatic effort) and winged reproductive ants (reproductive effort) produced across years. I use colonies collected from populations previously demonstrated to show significant differences in a risk-tolerance behavioral syndrome. I provide an empirical test of the POLS hypothesis between 2 populations of Temnothorax ants over three years. I find strong evidence for a POLS between populations and weaker, but present support for a within population POLS. More risk-tolerant populations also allocate more energy towards reproduction and grow faster across years. This study then emphasizes the value of a more holistic study of among-individual variation. Additionally, it suggests more research is needed on understanding how and why traits may correlate in some populations, but remain independent in others."

Parasite infection can have pervasive effects on hosts, including altering host behaviour, and may thus contribute to differences in host personality. We investigated the relationship between the three-spined stickleback and its common parasite Glugea anomala, with focus on differences in host personality. Naturally infected and uninfected individuals were assayed for the five personality traits activity, exploration, boldness, sociability, and aggression. If infected fish behaved differently from uninfected, to benefit this parasite with horizontal transmission, we predicted behaviour increasing interactions with other sticklebacks to increase. Infection status explained differences in host personality. Specifically, Glugea-infected individuals were more social than uninfected fish. This confirms a link between parasite infection and host behaviour, and a relationship which may improve the horizontal transmission of Glugea. However, future studies need to establish the consequences of this for the parasite, and the causality of the parasite-host personality relationship. Significance statement Parasite infection that alters host behaviour could be a possible avenue of research into the causes of animal personality. We studied the link between infection and personality using the three-spined stickleback and its parasite Glugea anomala. We predicted that infected individuals would be more prone to interact with other sticklebacks, since this would improve transmission of this parasite. The personality of uninfected and naturally infected fish was measured and we observed that Glugea-infected sticklebacks were more social. Our results confirm a link between parasitism and variation in host personality."

More and more studies have investigated correlations between behaviour(s) and other phenotypic traits, thereby seeking to understand among-individual variation in behaviour from either a proximate or an ultimate perspective. Statistically, such studies require the estimation of among-individual correlations, necessitating study designs where suites of labile traits are repeatedly assayed. Most published studies, by contrast, instead assume that among-individual correlations can be approximated using data of suites of phenotypic traits measured only once. Such studies take an `individual gambit' as they assume that phenotypic correlations between two traits measured once match among-individual correlations. A literature survey shows that this assumption was made in 62\% of empirical studies; this is a worrying trend as a mismatch between the research question and the study (or statistical) design can lead to biased conclusions about biological patterns. In this paper we use a visual approach to illustrate these concerns for a broad audience, thereby complementing previous papers using a jargon more suitable for the statistically oriented. We thereby seek to reiterate the notion that reliable answers to any scientific question require specific types of data. While this commentary underlines the importance of spelling out key assumptions in discussions of (suboptimal) data in scientific papers on individuality, our main message is that researchers should typically be able to avoid publishing studies with conclusions heavily hinging on unverifiable assumptions. This is because researchers normally have the freedom to decide a priori to focus their research towards questions for which appropriate data can arguably be collected. Doing so would greatly facilitate our ability to robustly address key questions of biological interest, such as the ecology and evolution of individuality.

Based on a sample of 25 animals, 143 h of behavioural data collection and 518 faecal samples, principal component analyses indicated the existence of four components that characterize the individuals' Genus Normative Behaviour (GNB) (KMO = 0.531, X-2 = 127.672, p < 0.001): `Feeding', `Sociability', `Exploration', and `Activity'. Other four components are related to stress coping styles (based on Behaviour Potentially Indicative of Stress - BPIS) (KMO = 0.550, X-2 = 329.303, p < 0.001): `Self-directed'; `Restless', `Ingestion/Self-Scratching', and `Stereotyped'. More active individuals exhibit rapid stress-related behaviours (r = 0.443; p = 0.044) while less active individuals exhibit more stationary stress-related behaviours (r = -0.519; p = 0.013). Akaike information criteria indicated that the best linear regression model to predict the physiological profile (Faecal Glucocorticoid Metabolites - FGM) included three GNB and three BPIS components. `Sociability' (p < 0.05), `Exploration' (p < 0.05), and `Ingestion/Self-scratching' (p < 0.05) predicted lower FGM levels. `Activity' (p < 0.05), `Self-directed' (p < 0.05), and `Stereotyped' (p < 0.05) predicted higher FGM levels. `Feeding' and `Restless' factors were not included in the models. Our results support previous studies indicating that animals within the same population differ in the way they behave and react to stressful conditions, and these are correlated to different physiological profiles. Mapping inter-individual differences in stress coping strategies may help clarify the long-term reported incongruity between behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare in captive animals, supporting better management practices and assisting translational models of the development of psychopathologies."

More exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% CI: 0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity."

However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s = 0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P = 0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day situations."

Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after 2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability; however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality research."

Nevertheless, research on individual variation in animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further investigation of the causality and dynamics of this relationship.Significance statementIn the ancestor of today's chickens, the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in another (i.e., there were no overall smarter birds). Exploration correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females, learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can differ depending on task and age of the animal."

Individuals of certain species have also been shown to differ in their rate of behavioural innovation in arriving at novel solutions to new and existing problems (e.g., mazes, novel foods). Here, we investigate whether behaviours traditionally studied in personality research are correlated with individual rates of innovation as part of a wider behavioural syndrome. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) of both sexes from three different wild population sources were assessed: (a) exploration of an open area; (b) speed through a three-dimensional maze; (c) investigation of a novel object; and (d) attraction to a novel food. The covariance structure (syndrome structure) was examined using structural equation modelling. The best model separated behaviours relating to activity in all contexts from rates of exploration/investigation and innovation. Innovative behaviour (utilizing new food and moving through a novel area) in these fish therefore forms part of the same syndrome as the traditional shy-bold continuum (exploration of an open area and investigation of a novel object) found in many animal personality studies. There were no clear differences in innovation or syndrome structure between the sexes, or between the three different populations. However, body size was implicated as part of the behavioural syndrome structure, and because body size is highly correlated with age in guppies, this suggests that individual behavioural differences in personality/innovation in guppies may largely be driven by developmental state."

A significant body of research has explored many of pertinent ecological and biological aspects that can be affected by them and their impact upon fitness. Currently little is known about how both factors interact and their effect on reproductive success. In this study, we evaluated two major parameters contributing to the fitness of the species: reproduction and offspring survival. We selected two different phenotypes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) selected by their colouration patterns: phenotype 1) named Wild type, UAB line (WT-UAB) with a homogeneous colouration pattern (clear and defined lateral stripes) and phenotype 2) Wild type indefinite (WT-I) had a heterogeneous colouration pattern and different degrees of lateral stripe definition. All animals were also screened for personality. We then compared their reproductive success (spawning rate) and offspring survival at different stages, from egg to larvae, and for 2 successive generations (parental generation was G0; First and second generations were G1 and G2 respectively). Our results show that personality traits were the main source of variability between the fitness components measured: both personalities had similar total numbers of eggs spawned but proactive animals, for both colour phenotypes, had higher reproductive success. This was reflected in a higher percentage of spawning viability at 1day post fertilization (dpf), higher total survival and growth rates at larval stages. Proactive phenotypes from WT-UAB population had a higher overall fitness in comparison to the other phenotypes studied. Our findings imply that fitness of this species when kept under similar husbandry conditions is significantly influenced by parental personality and not by their external appearance. Under these conditions the reproductive success is enhanced. The implications of this study are important for zebrafish breeding and husbandry in captivity and are relevant toward understanding the underlying drivers of trait selection in natural environments."

This adaptation is directly associated with the quality of the environment and to the possibility of expressing natural behaviours. Horses kept in stables often display a range of abnormal behaviours related to lack of control over their environment, which can lead to behavioural and health problems. An individual's personality also plays an important role in its susceptibility and resilience to the development of diseases and abnormal behaviour; thus, an evaluation of horses' personalities could be crucial to selecting individuals best able to cope with different work activities. This study aimed to assess the well-being of police horses maintained in a semi-confinement regime in Brazil by associating their personalities to the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and disease. Using a non-invasive approach, different tests were performed to investigate the horses' behaviour, personality and welfare. A frustration test and a novel object test were conducted with 46 horses and the individuals' personalities were assessed using questionnaires and behaviour tests. In addition, we evaluated their physical health through a survey of their veterinary records. The data for horses were evaluated individually. The results demonstrated the occurrence of multiple abnormal behaviours motivated by factors such as diet and lack of social contact. Moreover, the personality tests indicated this is an important component when evaluating welfare, since correlations were found between personality traits and abnormal behaviour expression, and between personality traits and health problems. According to our results, passive, stubborn, and confident horses are better suited to be selected as police horses. The ability to classify horses according to their personalities could help in selecting horses most suitable for patrolling, thereby helping to reduce behavioural problems and increasing animal well-being."

Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological traits using an invasive species-Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura island-as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of A. getulus. Significance statement Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients, has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes have higher survival chances than their counterparts."

Parental care can vary consistently between individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that, depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent, suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking parenting styles to fitness in swallow species."

The asset protection principle predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour.

Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Removal of individuals with particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk, and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status, with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance. Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.

Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls, produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the relevance of more vocal individuals for the group. Our work represents a step in understanding the importance of communication and individual vocal behaviour in group formation and stability in gregarious animals.

Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types. Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes. Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems."

We ran individual roach (Rutilus rutilus), a common freshwater fish, through a standard refuge emergence protocol to characterize their boldness, a key animal personality trait. We then paired a bold and a shy roach and exposed the pair to one of two predator species that have contrasting hunting modes to ascertain how personality traits shaped their survival during predator encounters. When a paired bold and shy prey fish interacted with a perch predator (active foraging mode), bold and shy prey were consumed in almost equal numbers. However, pike predators (ambush foraging mode) selectively consumed more shy prey, and prey body size and boldness score both contributed significantly to which prey fish was eaten. Our findings support the idea that multiple predators with different foraging modes, and hence differential selection on prey personality, could contribute to maintaining variation in personality in prey populations. Furthermore, for social species, including shoaling fish, the ultimate consequences of an individual's personality may depend upon the personality of its nearby conspecifics. Animals of the same species often look similar, but individuals show differences in their behavior that can have important consequences, for instance when these individuals interact with predators. The common roach is a freshwater fish that shows inter-individual variation in its propensity to take risks, a key personality trait often termed boldness. Variation in boldness may affect the outcome when roach interact with predators, i.e., if they get eaten or survive. However, we found the impact of roachs' personality type depends on what species of predatory fish they face. When we put a shy and a bold roach together with predatory perch, the roachs' personality did not significantly affect which individual was eaten. But when the predator was a pike, the predators selectively ate more shy roach, and the likelihood an individual would be eaten depended on their body size."

We encourage researchers to test additional sites to assess the generality of our results. Boldness decreased with crab size at the less disturbed sites, while no relationship between size and boldness was found at the disturbed site. Boldness increased with habitat disturbance, perhaps because bolder crabs succeed in exploiting food around people. Repeatability and plasticity were similar across sites. We hypothesize that population differences may be the result of developmental plasticity when aquatic larvae settle on a beach or selection for boldness at the disturbed site acting on each new generation."

I extend this thinking to include longer time scales, suggesting that macroevolutionary transitions can create phenotypic differences among species, which then have predictable impacts on species interactions, community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Repeated speciation can exacerbate these patterns by creating communities with similar phenotypes and hence ecological impacts. Here, I use several experiments to test these ideas in dragonfly larvae that occupy ponds with fish, ponds without fish, or both. I show that macroevolutionary transitions between habitats cause fishless pond species to be more active relative to fish pond specialists, reducing prey abundance, shifting prey community composition and creating stronger trophic cascades. These effects scale up to the community level with predictable consequences for ecosystem multi-functioning. I suggest that macroevolutionary history can have predictable impacts on phenotypic traits, with consequences for interacting species and ecosystems."

However, in social groups inflexible behavioral phenotypes might be favored as this could lead to more predictable social interactions. Two hypotheses seek to describe the optimal distribution of personality types within groups. The social niche specialization hypothesis states that individuals within groups should partition social roles, like personality types, to avoid conflict; whereas the conformity hypothesis states that individuals should assort with conspecifics of similar personality. However, no research so far has compared these hypotheses using data from wild animal systems. We tested boldness in the wild on 2 species with different social systems, the Mexican Jay and California Scrub-Jay. We found support for the conformity hypothesis over the social niche specialization hypothesis because individuals within groups of the social species had more similar personalities, and consequently there was a statistically significant group effect.

We then let each turtle choose between environments simulating both rearing conditions in a novel enclosure to evaluate the hypothesis that rearing environment influences habitat selection. Preference for the enriched environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.62-0.98) turtles.

Preference for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior experience.

This hypothesis predicts that life history, behavioral, and physiological traits will covary under clearly defined conditions. Empirical tests are equivocal and suggest that the conditions necessary for the POLS to emerge are not always met. We nuance and expand the POLS hypothesis to consider alternative relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history. These relationships will vary with the nature of predation risk, the challenges posed by resource acquisition, and the energy management strategies of organisms. We also discuss how the plastic response of behavior, physiology, and life history to changes in ecological conditions and variation in resource acquisition among individuals determine our ability to detect a fast-slow pace of life in the first place or associations among these traits. Future empirical studies will provide most insights on the coevolution among behavior, physiology, and life history by investigating these traits both at the genetic and phenotypic levels in varying types of predation regimes and levels of resource abundance. We revisit the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, suggesting that behaviors involving a risk of death or injury should coevolve with higher metabolic rates, higher fecundity, faster growth, and heightened mortality rates. Empirical support for this hypothesis is mixed. We show how relaxing some of the assumptions underlying the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis allows us to consider alternative relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history, and why we fail to meet the predictions posed by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis in some populations.

We investigated the development of two innate (titers of natural antibodies and complement) and one adaptive (immunoglobulin G) immune effectors across multiple life stages. In addition, we tested if three behaviors, indicating risk-taking and stress-coping, differed between seasons. Finally, we tested if behaviors and immune traits correlate with each other as predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. The season of birth influenced average trait expression of both immunity and behavior. Boldness, indicating risk-taking behavior, correlated positively with the titers of natural antibodies, fitting the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS). However, fearlessness, indicating how an individual copes with a stressful situation, correlated positively with immunoglobulin G concentrations, against the predictions of the POLS. Together, our results show that behaviors and immune traits react to differences in expected life histories, but do not show the predicted covariation. We conclude that proximate mechanisms and different functions of traits need to be considered to predict the nature of behavior-immune associations. Individual life histories, behavior, and immunity are strongly influenced by the environment individual's experience during early life. Recent theory predicts correlations between behavior and immunity to arise as a consequence of different life histories. By simulating different birth seasons, we induced different life history expectations as well as a season-dependent development of immunity and behavior. However, correlations between behavior and immunity do not fit theoretical predictions, highlighting the need for more detailed theory."

Consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour (individual behavioural types, BTs) of predator and prey (or both) may fundamentally shape their mutual interactions. Several recent studies have shown that it is important to consider the interaction of BTs on both sides of predator-prey interactions. Otherwise, there is a high risk of erroneous inference about the outcome of predation. Until now, however, no study has investigated how BT vs BT interaction affects the predation of mesopredators by top predators, especially when the mesopredator is a low-ranked prey for the top predator. Such knowledge is extremely important if we want to predict the effect of individual BTs on food web dynamics. We have investigated in our laboratory experiments how foraging aggressiveness of the top predator (spider, Philodromus cespitum, Philodromidae) and risk-aversion as a form of shyness of the mesopredator (spider, Philodromus albidus, Philodromidae) determine the probability of predation. The highest explanatory power had the model with additive effects of mesopredator's risk-aversion and top predator's foraging aggressiveness. Other models, including those with BT vs BT interaction, had poor explanatory power. It was probably due to the fact that timid top predators are often choosy and do not catch low-ranked prey, while aggressive top predators are opportunists. The risk-averse mesopredators are also more cautious than risk-prone mesopredators regarding their surroundings and can defend themselves faster. Our results therefore fit with the classical hypothesis about trade-off between foraging and safety. Behavioural types of predator and prey jointly determine the mortality of prey. In our laboratory experiments, we investigated how foraging aggressiveness of a top predator spider and the risk-aversion of a mesopredator spider (potential prey) determine the probability of predation. We demonstrated that top predator's foraging aggressiveness and mesopredator's risk-aversion determine the probability of mesopredator's mortality only additively. The mesopredator's probability of being killed decreased with its risk-aversion and increased with top predator's foraging aggressiveness. The effect was additive instead of interactive because the mesopredator represents a dangerous prey for the top predator. The timid top predators are also choosy and do not attack dangerous prey, while the aggressive/non-choosy top predators are opportunistic. Further, the risk-averse mesopredators are more cautious regarding their surroundings and can react faster to the presence of a top predator, compared to risk-prone and slowly reacting mesopredators."

This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0\%, 0.1\% and 0.5\% (v/v\%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0\% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish. However, 0.5\% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal, while both 0.1\% and 0.5\% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens."

In laboratory experiments with wild-caught great tits (Parus major), we tested the effect of exploratory behaviour (performance in novel food, object and environment test, startle test) on the ability of individual birds to assess the threat represented by a predator. We presented a wooden dummy of the European sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), an extremely dangerous predator, and its visual modifications (chimeras), changing the beak or head to be non-threatening (those of a pigeon - Columba Livia f domestica). We showed that the differences between `slow' and `fast explorers' are not very distinct, but that `slow explorers' generally tended to be more cautious in the presence of an unmodified sparrowhawk dummy, while the `fast explorers' tended to observe the dummy. On the contrary, `slow explorers' tended to treat both chimaeras (and the pigeon dummy as well) as less-threatening than `fast explorers'. Since `slow explorers' are usually considered to be more sensitive to environmental cues, it came as no surprise that most of them correctly assessed the unmodified sparrowhawk dummy as threatening, while they probably subjected the chimeras to a detailed inspection and were not confused by the presence of sparrowhawk features and assessed them as non-threatening."

One possibility is that among-individual behavioural variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome' in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources, while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality variation observed in wild populations.

While this variability may have important ecological and evolutionary implications, how and why variation in animal personality is maintained in a natural population remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of environmental and biological sources of variation on behavioral responses measured along the shy-bold continuum in a long-lived, iteroparous marine mammal, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). Between 2008 and 2016, 469 females from the Sable Island, Nova Scotia breeding colony of gray seals were given a boldness score in response to a human approach, designed to stimulate maternal defense of offspring. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable between and within years. There were age differences in boldness, with younger females being less bold than older, more experienced females providing some support for the life history trade-off hypothesis. We further used GLMMs to assess sources of variation on offspring weaning mass. We found that young females that were bolder produced heavier pups than shyer counterparts, and that pups produced by bolder females were on average 2 kg heavier than pups of shy females. These results provide further evidence that personality influences life history strategies, and illustrates the evolutionary potential of animal personality in response to selection. Consistent individual differences in behavior influence various aspects of ecology including species interactions, species distributions, and life history strategies. However, how and why this individual variation is maintained in a natural population remains uncertain. In this study, we assessed the influence of boldness, specifically maternal defense of offspring, on a component of reproductive success in a long-lived marine mammal. We showed highly repeatable behavioral differences, and found that boldness varied with age, with younger individuals being less bold than older individuals. Younger individuals that were bolder produced heavier offspring than shyer counterparts. Our study contributes to an under-represented group of animals, wild marine mammals, in the personality literature, and further prompts the investigation into the proximate and ultimate factors influencing personality in an ecologically important marine predator."

There are similarities in dog and human manifestations of trait impulsivity at the behavioural, genetic, and neurobiological level. We investigated a well-validated measure of dog impulsivity and responsivity (the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale, DIAS) and a neuropsychological theory of human trait approach and avoidance (the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality, RST). Owners reported their dogs' dispositional behaviour on the DIAS, an RST scale modified to describe dogs' behaviour, and a list of common dog behaviour problems. In a sample of 730 dogs, we observed convergence between the RST and the DIAS. There was a negative correlation between RST `Behaviour Inhibition System' and DIAS impulsivity factor ('Behavioural Regulation'). RST `Behavioural Approach System' correlated positively with DIAS `Responsiveness'. The RST `Fight-Flight-Freeze System' (FFFS) and the DIAS `Aggression and response to novelty factor were both distinct from other factors. However, the DIAS `Aggression and response to novelty' factor and the RST FFFS explained different aspects of dog behaviour problems. Importantly, whilst the DIAS factors indicated tendencies towards avoidant behaviours, the FFFS discriminated between active and passive avoidance. The findings suggest a partial overlapping between the DIAS and RST scales, and highlights the utility of personality models in investigating behaviour problems in dogs."

We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals' choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems."

Consequently, there is growing recognition that knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make important contributions to our understanding of the development and proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral types for release. Significance statement Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs."

Yet, little work has been carried out to connect any behavioral correlates found within a set of laboratory studies to natural behavior observed under complex environmental conditions. To help fill this gap, individual crayfish, collected from the same local population, completed five different behavioral assays in a laboratory setting in a random order. These data were used to reveal any possible correlations for behavioral scores across all of the laboratory tests. Subsequently, these same individuals were placed into the field and video recorded for 24hr. A separate set of field behaviors, related to the laboratory assays, were quantified from the field videos. The normalized laboratory and field behaviors were used in three stepwise statistical analyses. First, normalized data were loaded into a PCA to generate a priori hypotheses on potential behavioral correlates. These hypotheses were subsequently tested using general multiple linear regression. Finally, structural equation modeling was performed to elucidate any behavioral modules from the laboratory assays that correlated with behavioral patterns present from the fieldwork. Three laboratory-based behavioral modules were connected to three separate field assays: exploration-avoidance, bold-shy, and aggressiveness. Yet, some behaviors exhibited in the laboratory assays were uncorrelated with any behaviors found in the field and vice versa. Results from this study provide evidence that although many different behavioral correlates may exist within laboratory settings, these same modules may not translate directly into predicting behavior under natural settings."

Various models, revolving around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals, attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types within a population, and evaluating them is the key for understanding the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear to protect their assets however, as estimates of residual reproductive value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal consistency that are more difficult to explain."

While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase. Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g. eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits, suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and vice versa.

Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is, activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age. Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits, the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals might affect the further development and survival of populations and thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the ecosystem.

The social environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness, activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation. Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets becoming less explorative.

Yet, the potential for animal personality to affect more complex and non-linear food webs, like those seen in nature, remains understudied. Here, we explore the degree to which the aggregate behaviors of two predator species simultaneously interact to alter prey survival rates and the presence and magnitude of trophic cascades. We set up mesocosms in an old-field habitat containing four different insect prey species and either two Phidippus clarus (Salticidae), two Platycryptus undatus (Salticidae), or one of each predator. Prior to initiating each mesocosm, we assayed the activity level and boldness of each individual predator and included these metrics in our models predicting prey survival and plant damage. We then compared the number of surviving prey and plant damage under each of these conditions and tested for associations between each of these response variables and predator behavior. We found no significant effect of predator community composition or predators' behavior on prey survival or plant damage. These results suggest that the effects of predator personality on prey survival may be subtle or absent in complex species interaction modules. Significance statement Although much research suggests that animal personality can influence broader scale ecological phenomena, the ability of animal personality to alter complex species interaction modules remains unresolved. We tested whether pairs of predators of different personality types differentially impacted prey survival rates and plant damage in a tritrophic system, and whether these effects varied based on predator community composition. We recovered no evidence that predator personality types influenced prey survival or plant damage regardless of the predator composition considered. These results suggest that the effects of personality may be absent or undetectable in more complex, realistic ecological settings. The majority of laboratory-based personality studies published to date evaluate only dyadic species interactions in simplified environments. Our findings therefore raise concerns that such studies are prone to overestimate the effects of animal personality."

In this experimental study we tested whether naturally occurring predation causes personality dependent mortality of a marine isopod (Idotea balthica), which could maintain personality variation in nature. Moreover, as isopods are known to have sex-differences in behaviour, we were interested in whether personality-dependent predation was sex-specific. We also hypothesised that predation pressure among personality types could vary according to habitat type, as it has been shown in correlative studies that habitat may influence personality variation. We used natural predator (European perch Perca fluviatilis) of I. balthica and studied relative mortality of males and females with a different personality types in laboratory settings with two different habitats. We found that survival in males was lower than in females for high active individuals. Moreover, survival under predation was linked to body size differently in females and males. This, however, depended on personality class as larger size was advantageous for low-active males and middle- and high-active females. Conversely, smaller size was advantageous for low-active females and middle-active males. Size did not affect survival in high-active males. Our results suggest that predation can encourage life-history differences between sexes leading to different optimal life-history strategies and also maintains consistent activity for both sexes."

Perhaps one of the most essential drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced during their early-life development. Although the study of coping, defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges, has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2), which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4) and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents, habitat, nutrition, social group and stress are discussed using examples from empirical studies on mammals, fish, birds and other animals. In the discussion, we address important problems that arise when studying the development of coping behaviours and suggest solutions."

Originally developed for understanding variation in LH strategies at the among-population level, the POL theory has more recently been applied towards understanding variation in LH traits at the within-population level, and further extended to address the covariance of LH traits with additional behavioural and/or physiological traits, referred to as pace-of-life syndromes (POLS). The article by Reale et al. (Philos T Roy Soc B 365: 4051-4063, 2010), which synthesized several earlier reviews and opinions on among-individual covariation between LH, behavioural, and physiological traits, and subsequent research testing POLS in a variety of species, have collectively been cited several hundreds of times-a trend that continues. These works have interdisciplinary impact, informing research in life history biology, behavioural and developmental biology, and the social sciences. In this paper, we review the existing theoretical POLS models that provide adaptive explanations for covariances between LH traits and additional behavioural and/or physiological traits while assuming a trade-off between current and future reproduction. We find that the set of relevant models is small. Moreover, models show that covariances between life history traits and behavioural or physiological traits can arise even in the absence of a current-future reproduction trade-off, implying that observing such covariances does not provide a strong indication regarding the process generating POLS. We discuss lessons learned from existing models of POLS, highlight key gaps in the modelling literature, and provide guidelines for better integration between theory and data."

A meta-analysis of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis,"Royaute, Raphael and Berdal, Monica Anderson and Garrison, Courtney R. and Dochtermann, Ned A.",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,0340-5443,72,3,NA,2018,SPRINGER,10.1007/s00265-018-2472-z,"The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts that individual differences in behavior should integrate with morphological, physiological, and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life continuum. For example, individuals with a ``slow{''} pace-of-life are expected to exhibit a slower growth rate, delayed reproduction, longer lifespans, have stronger immune responses, and are expected to avoid risky situations relative to ``fast{''} individuals. If supported, this hypothesis would help resolve ecological and evolutionary questions regarding the origin and maintenance of phenotypic variation. Support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has, however, been mixed. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 articles and 179 estimates testing the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis as it applies to the integration of behaviors with physiological or life-history traits. We found little overall support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis with the mean support estimated as r = 0.06. Support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis was significantly higher in invertebrates (r = 0.23) than vertebrates (r = 0.02) and significantly higher when based on phenotypic (r = 0.10) versus genetic correlations (r = -0.09). We also found that females exhibited correlations between behavior and life-history and physiology that were opposite the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis (r = -0.16) and that these correlations significantly differed from those observed in males (r = 0.01) or males and females pooled (r = 0.12). It was also the case that there was little support for the hypothesis when life-history and physiological traits were independently analyzed (behavior x life-history: r = 0.12; behavior x physiology: r = 0.04). Exploratory post hoc analyses revealed that correlations of behavior with growth rate and hormone levels were more likely to show support for the predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. The lack of overall support found in our analyses suggests that general assertions regarding phenotypic integration due to ``pace-of-life{''} should be re-evaluated. Significance statement The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has been proposed as an overall organizational framework for the integration of behavioral, life-history, and physiological traits. This hypothesis provides potentially profound insights into how and why phenotypic traits might covary and why phenotypic variation may be maintained within populations. Over the last 7 years, this organizational framework has been intensively investigated as it pertains to relationships between behavior and other traits. Here, we conducted an overall analysis of whether the hypothesis was supported. Despite considerable research investment across behavioral ecology, we did not find that available data supported the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. This suggests that either the hypothesis has been inappropriately tested or is not generally applicable."

Theory suggests that stable social states, for example, stable social hierarchies, may lead to consistent variation in behavior, that is, variation in personality. Our results suggest that variation in personality is not a consequence of variation in social status and that personality is more important than current social position in determining individual behavior in stable groups.Individuals often differ in behavior in a consistent way, that is, they show variation in personality. Understanding the processes explaining the emergence and maintenance of this variation is a current major topic in the field of animal behavioral research. Recent theoretical models predict that differences in various ``states{''} can generate individual variation in behavior. Previous studies have mainly focused on endogenous states like metabolic rate or energy reserves, but theory also suggests that states based on social interactions could play important roles in shaping personality. We have earlier demonstrated short-term status-dependent variation in behavior in the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), but whether such behavioral variation remains also after a longer period of time, is unknown. Therefore, we examine the influence of social status on variation in behavior, using experimental manipulation of social status in pairs of male domestic fowl. We scored males in 3 personality assays (novel arena test, novel object test, and aggression test) before and after 3 weeks in pairs as either dominant or subordinate. We observed individual consistency of behavior despite alteration of social status. We further found no support for social status acting as a state that generates variation in personality over the used time interval: social status had no significant effect on the change in behavioral responses between repeated personality tests. Our results suggest that personality is more important than current social situation for describing individual behavior in stable groups."

A recent hypothesis suggests that one predictor of individual variation in cognition is personality, and specifically that personality types are linked to cognitive styles through a speed-accuracy trade-off. We tested specific predictions of this hypothesis, measuring individual differences in associative learning speed and flexibility, quantified via reversal learning, of 86 bank voles, Myodes glareolus, along with their activity and boldness. We found that bolder and more active individuals were fast, inflexible and persistent in the associative learning tasks, whereas shyer and less active individuals were slow and flexible. We also found evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off: correct choices in the cognitive tasks required more time for all individuals compared to incorrect choices, but bolder, more active voles always made their decisions faster than reactive ones. The difference between the time required for a correct and an incorrect choice was most pronounced in initial learning for shyer and less active individuals, but for bolder, more active individuals it was most pronounced in the reversal learning task. We also found differences related to sex and age: females were faster than males to update information or correct incorrect choices and older animals took longer to initiate the test. Our results confirm the hypothesis that individual differences in behaviour are reflected in different `cognitive styles', differentially trading off speed for flexibility and accuracy in cognitive tasks. Moreover, we provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of such a trade-off in a small mammal. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How these differences are maintained in response to changes in population density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates. Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity. Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in other ecological processes ( e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice, disease transfer)."

A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in `personality'evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the integration of `intrinsic state' and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones, energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate.

Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which describes variation within an individual through time, and personality, which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored. Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms generating individual variation.

For directly transmitted parasites, parasite transmission depends on social interaction patterns that can be quantified using social network metrics. For indirectly transmitted parasites, the key can be transmission networks that quantify time-lagged contacts (e.g. where potential hosts visit locations used earlier by infected hosts). Social network connections (time-lagged or not) often result from shared space use determined by individual movements in response to key environmental factors. Movement ecology provides a framework for understanding these responses. Finally, individuals with different personalities likely respond differently to environmental factors in ways that influence the movements and space use that underlie network connectivity, which, in turn, affects parasite loads and transmission. We illustrate these key points with recent work on sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their ticks. By GPS tracking of nearly all adult lizards at our site, we found that lizards that more frequently shared the same refuges (where ticks detach and reattach to a new host) used earlier by other lizards tended to indeed have higher tick loads. Higher shared refuge use was associated with greater shared space use, in general. Shared space use with conspecifics was reduced by the lizards' general propensity (quantified by analyses of 279 985 GPS locations for 72 lizards) to avoid conspecifics, but enhanced by their general tendency to prefer areas with more resources and better refuge (in particular, late in the season when food was scarce and conditions were hotter and drier). Both of these tendencies were personality dependent. Less aggressive lizards exhibited both a stronger attraction to areas with more food and better refuge, and a stronger tendency to avoid other lizards. We conclude by discussing implications of our results for the general conceptual framework and suggest future directions.

It is not known, however, whether an individual's suite of social behaviours consistently covaries through time and across different types of social interactions. Consistent social behaviour would be advantageous in groups, especially when individuals need to remember their group members' social roles and preferences in order to keep track of social relationships and predict conspecifics' future behaviour. Here, we address whether social behaviour of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, is consistent through time and across four interaction networks (aggression, grooming, contact calling, scent marking). We quantified variation in social behaviour through four network centrality measures including outdegree, outstrength, betweenness and eigenvector centrality. Comparing lemurs' measures across 2 years revealed that network centrality remained consistent between years. Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus, regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific, but instead persists through time and across multiple social interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles, including how socially active they are and with whom they interact.

The role of sexual selection in this process is controversial; however, most of the work has centered on mate choice while the role of male-male competition in speciation is relatively understudied. Here, we outline how male-male competition can be a source of diversifying selection on male competitive phenotypes, and how this can contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We highlight how negative frequency-dependent selection (advantage of rare phenotype arising from stronger male-male competition between similar male phenotypes compared with dissimilar male phenotypes) and disruptive selection (advantage of extreme phenotypes) drives the evolution of diversity in competitive traits such as weapon size, nuptial coloration, or aggressiveness. We underscore that male-male competition interacts with other life-history functions and that variable male competitive phenotypes may represent alternative adaptive options. In addition to competition for mates, aggressive interference competition for ecological resources can exert selection on competitor signals. We call for a better integration of male-male competition with ecological interference competition since both can influence the process of speciation via comparable but distinct mechanisms. Altogether, we present a more comprehensive framework for studying the role of male-male competition in speciation, and emphasize the need for better integration of insights gained from other fields studying the evolutionary, behavioral, and physiological consequences of agonistic interactions."

While predation risk is rarely constant in natural populations, the extent to which variation in predation risk shapes individual behaviour in wild populations remains unclear. Here, we investigated individual differences in reproductive behaviour in 16 Trinidadian guppy populations and related it to the observed variation in predator biomass each population experienced. Our results show that high heterogeneity in predator biomass is linked to individual behavioural diversification. Increased within-population heterogeneity in predator biomass is also associated with behavioural polymorphism. Some individuals adjust the frequency of consensual mating behaviour in response to differences in sex ratio context, while others display constantly at elevated frequencies. This pattern is analogous to a `live fast, die young' pace-of-life syndrome. Notably, both high and low mean differences in predator biomass led to a homogenization of individual frequency of consensual mating displays. Overall, our results demonstrate that individual behavioural variation is associated with heterogeneity in predator biomass, but not necessarily with changes in mean values of predator biomass. We suggest that heterogeneity in predator biomass is an informative predictor of adaptive responses to changes in biotic conditions."

Firstly, I review five general categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g., connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches allowing comparisons of social networks pre-versus post-infection are a promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks and parasite infections."

Cuckoo chicks showed high repeatability of both aggressive behaviour and breath rate, and both traits were strongly correlated with each other. This represents the first evidence for consistent differences in behaviour among avian brood parasites. Males were consistently more aggressive and less stressed than females. Nestlings of both sexes that hatched later in the season exhibited higher levels of aggression and lower stress responses than nestlings hatched earlier. This suggests that rearing conditions (e.g., food availability and quality) may modulate stress and aggressive phenotypes of brood parasites.

Using colourful and drab male house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) from urban and rural sites, we showed that combat rate was repeatable across the same and different group sizes for birds who won competitions. In addition, colourful urban males exhibited the lowest propensity for frequent aggression (and hence low combat rate).

Male and female neophobia was assessed by attaching novel objects to birds' feeders. Females' mating preferences were tested with randomly assigned, unfamiliar males in a four-way choice apparatus.

Our results indicated that tests presumably targeting the same personality trait actually measured distinct behavioural aspects. Syndrome defined using correlation changed due to how we identified personality traits, but not when using structural equation models (SEMs). Overall, this study emphasizes that it is critical to clarify the approach and terms we use for `personality traits' in the field of animal personality."

M. and Gruber, S. H. and Krause, J.",BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,0340-5443,72,1,NA,2018,SPRINGER,10.1007/s00265-017-2431-0,"Despite substantial research interest in understanding individual-level consistency in behavioral attributes, significant knowledge gaps remain across traits and taxa. For example, relatively few studies have looked at social personality in large marine species such as elasmobranchs and whether or not individual differences in behavior are maintained in unstable social groups (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics). However, it is important to investigate this topic in other model species than the usually small species with short generation times typically investigated in these areas of behavioral ecology. Indeed, studies on ecologically diverse taxa could provide mechanistic insights into the emergence and maintenance of animal personality and dynamics of social groups in animals. In addition, understanding social behavior at the group-and individual-level could improve conservation management of these large animals with long generation times (e.g., removal of particular behavioral types by fisheries practices). Here, we investigated consistent individual differences in sociability in wild juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) over both short- (4 to 18 days) and long-term (4 months) sampling periods. Individual sharks were observed in social groups and scored according to the number of social interactions performed during observations. Despite variable individual group compositions between repeated trials, sharks showed consistent individual differences in their social behavior over both time scales. These results suggest reduced plasticity and highlight individuality as an important explanatory variable for the social dynamics of juvenile lemon sharks. In addition, long-term stability observed in this wild population demonstrates the importance of personality in the daily behavioral repertoire of juvenile lemon sharks. Our results are discussed in the context of other shark studies and taxonomic groups and potential avenues for future research are proposed. Significance statement This study investigated the social personality axis in a wild population of juvenile lemon sharks. First, we demonstrated consistent individual differences in their tendency to socialize. Second, we showed that individuals maintained their differences over a four-month period in the wild. Finally, we found that individual social behaviors were maintained despite being tested in variable group compositions. These results highlight the importance of individuality in the social dynamic of a poorly investigated animal and suggest personality as an important aspect of juvenile lemon sharks' everyday life over a relatively long-term period."

This phenomenon is referred to as ``animal personality,{''} and recent efforts seek to determine the implications of personality for interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. Doing so promises to illuminate how selection is operating on behavioral traits and, consequently, how stable, among-individual variation in behavioral types is maintained evolutionarily. We examined a natural population of forest-dwelling eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) to understand the effects of differences in levels of boldness on thermoregulatory behavior, injury history, and movement rates. Repeated behavioral trials revealed that individual turtles varied consistently and dramatically in boldness (latency to emerge from the shell or begin moving after handling and confinement). Behavioral differences were independent of phenotypic state or environmental conditions, suggesting the existence of personality in these turtles. Moreover, bolder turtles maintained higher body temperatures in the field and tended to have more damage to their shells, possibly indicative of more frequent predation attempts. Little work has been done on personality in terrestrial ectotherms, and this study enhances our understanding of this phenomenon by highlighting the potential trade-off between mortality and thermoregulation. Significance statement Animals often exhibit markedly different personality traits from each other. We sought to understand how personality traits affect interactions with the environment, and thus how natural selection may be acting upon and maintaining behavioral variation. We studied this in terrestrial ectotherms, box turtles, for whom the trade-off between basking and predation risk may be a significant factor. We found that individual turtles differed consistently in boldness (time spent hiding and immobile after handling) and that bolder turtles maintained higher body temperatures but tended to have more injuries on their shells. This suggests that being bold is beneficial for thermoregulation, which may enhance growth and fecundity, but could expose turtles to greater risk of predation. Variation in the expression of boldness may, therefore, serve to maintain behavioral variation in the population."

Borrowing insights from the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific contests, but also in foraging, mating, and antipredator behavior, then population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in demographic rates. We modeled a population with a boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their nonaggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive types into a homogeneous nonaggressive population increases the average per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait."

Responding to alarm signals can, for instance, maximize survival under predation risk. However, foraging individuals should consider the reliability of such risk-based information to balance antipredator behavior and resource acquisition. Receiver decisions could depend on personality effects, as individual variation in risk-taking tendencies (i.e., boldness) could not only affect receiver perception of the signaled threat but also signaler reliability. Recent theoretical models support the possibility of coevolution between personality and communication strategies. Using a playback experiment, we show that wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) respond to alarm calls according to their own boldness level (measured as consistent individual differences in basal vigilance) and that they increase their vigilance response to bolder callers potentially considered as more reliable. Further, receivers respond to the callers' boldness regardless of their own boldness and independently of their familiarity level with callers, therefore decoding this information from vocalizations. Such effects of individual behavioral variation on the perception and interpretation of social information could apply to signals used in a variety of ecological contexts."

However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree, centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in 3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers of social behavior."

While incubation temperature is well known to influence development in oviparous animals, little is known of the role of parental temperature on offspring phenotype (i.e. thermal parental effects). Following exposure of male and gravid female jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, to one of two thermal treatments (short-bask versus long-bask) and incubation of their eggs at a constant temperature, we examined whether the preovipositional parental treatment influenced offspring performance-related behaviours. We detected main and interactive effects of parental treatment on offspring behaviours including feeding, exploration and antipredator. Sex-specific effects of parental treatment included long-bask sons being more likely to feed and being bolder following predatory attack than short-bask sons, while the differences between treatments for daughters were smaller. Behaviours were not consistent between 1 week and 1 month of age and showed little correlation across behavioural contexts. Some behaviours emerged as promising mechanisms of documented parental effects on offspring growth and survival in these individuals. In particular, boldness among long-bask sons in an antipredator context may be linked to their greater rates of growth posthatching. Overall, our findings suggest that thermal parental effects influence variation in animal behaviours relevant for subsequent fitness outcomes.

In group-living animals, social conformity occurs when animals compromise their own behaviour to the level of a certain behaviour displayed by another individual or a group, and the degree to which individuals conform can depend upon interindividual differences in behavioural types. Social conformity can increase group cohesion and ultimately predator avoidance and/or resource acquisition for group-living individuals. However, it remains unclear whether similar conformity effects exist in solitary species, many of which form temporary aggregations and, if so, whether changes in behaviour in the presence of conspecifics are dependent on individuals' personalities in solitary contexts. We studied the effects of social context (i.e. the presence of a conspecific) on behaviour in solitary shore crabs, using automated video tracking. Individuals differed consistently in their activity levels within and across contexts and were significantly more active in solitary than dyadic contexts. No differences in activity between same- and opposite-sex dyads were found. Crabs' activity levels were more similar when tested together than when tested alone, indicating a social conformity effect. Furthermore, more active behavioural types decreased their activity to a greater extent when paired with a conspecific. The sex composition of the dyad had no effect on changes in activity. Overall, our findings suggest that social conformity is moderated by individual behavioural differences in a solitary organism. It is often presumed that, over evolutionary time, the social structure of animal populations has important consequences for the evolution of personalities and vice versa. We suggest that studying solitary or facultatively social organisms may allow researchers to tease out causality between personality differences and socioecological dynamics.

How this form of selection varies across environmental contexts is essential to predicting ecological and evolutionary dynamics, yet remains currently unresolved. Here, we use three separate predator-prey systems (sea star-snail, wolf spider-cricket, and jumping spider-cricket) to independently examine how habitat structural complexity influences the selection that predators impose on prey behavioral types. Prior to conducting staged predator-prey interaction encounters, we ran prey individuals through multiple behavioral assays to determine their average activity level. We then allowed individual predators to interact with groups of prey in either open or structurally complex habitats and recorded the number and individual identity of prey that were eaten. Habitat complexity had no effect on overall predation rates in any of the three predator-prey systems. Despite this, we detected a pervasive interaction between habitat structure and individual prey activity level in determining individual prey survival. In open habitats, all predators imposed strong selection on prey behavioral types: sea stars preferentially consumed sedentary snails, while spiders preferentially consumed active crickets. Habitat complexity dampened selection within all three systems, equalizing the predation risk that active and sedentary prey faced. These findings suggest a general effect of habitat complexity that reduces the importance of prey activity level in determining individual predation risk. We reason this occurs because activity level (i.e., movement) is paramount in determining risk within open environments, whereas in complex habitats, other behavioral traits (e.g., escape ability to a refuge) may take precedence."

However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold, mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015 and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent, risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be reduced in African penguins."

Covariation between response and effect traits has been poorly examined at the intraspecific level, thus hampering progress in understanding how phenotypic variability alters the role of organisms in ecosystems. Using a multi-trait approach and a nine-month longitudinal monitoring of individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome, respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and evolutionary ecology."

Increased contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality, consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability. Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in natural populations.

Three treatments were tested: only bold larvae, only shy larvae, and a mixed treatment (bold larvae + shy larvae) at a density for 16 larvae/L, which were fed 3 times a day with Anemia nauplii.

Here, we explore the degree to which individual differences in anti-predator response (or boldness) influence survival rates in groups of snails Chlorostoma funebralis when they encounter a predatory sea star Pisaster giganteus. The snail C. funebralis shows consistent individual variation in predator response where some fearful snails actively flee bodies of water occupied by predators whereas bolder snails consistently do not. We show here that bold snails are significantly more likely to survive encounters with a predatory sea star and, somewhat counterintuitively, fearful snails actually suffer higher mortality rates. We also found that smaller snails and those occurring at higher experimental densities experienced higher per capita survival rates. Positive effects of prey boldness on survival are not uncommonly reported in the animal personality literature; however, such results are inconsistent with classic animal personality theory borrowed from the optimal foraging literature. The findings herein add to the growing body of evidence that consistent individual differences in behavior can impact predator-prey interactions and that boldness is potentially under positive predator-driven selection in some systems."

State-dependence theory suggests that behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition, gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments. Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural predictability, but not in behavioural type."

We used individual-based monitoring data from 98 GPS-collared brown bears in Scandinavia to estimate diel activity patterns before the fall hunting season. We extracted 7 activity measures related to timing and regularity of activity from individual activity profiles. We then used multivariate analysis to test for the existence of distinct activity tactics and their environmental determinants, followed by generalized linear regression to estimate the extent of within-individual repeatability of activity tactics. We detected 4 distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods. We did not find evidence of diel activity tactics influencing survival during the subsequent hunting season. We conclude that individual variation in activity deserves greater attention than it currently receives, as it may help account for individual heterogeneity in fitness and could facilitate within-population niche partitioning that can have population-or community-level consequences."

This dispersal syndrome suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately, colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity, exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1) dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2) aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding, thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an important role in dispersal decisions.

We measured exploration and parental provisioning behaviours and used a path analysis to ask how the interplay between these two behavioural traits affected reproductive success in each of these two habitats. We found that blue tits breeding in the pinewood were slow-exploring compared to blue tits breeding in the oakwood, suggesting the occurrence of personality-related differences in settlement, or behavioural plasticity in response to habitat. Exploration behaviour and feeding rates were positively associated, suggesting that they affect each other or that there is an environmental factor affecting both traits simultaneously. Finally, fast explorers were favoured in the pinewood, while there was no selection acting on exploration behaviour in the oak habitat. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating habitat selection, plasticity and personality in the study of behavioural evolution."

We investigated size, energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout. In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1 month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by recapture probability), but no significant differences between food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments. For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk. Significance statement In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab, but not realized in natural streams."

However, behavioural plasticity and the adjustment of behaviours to new environments have been a classical explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age. Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as `personality'. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of personality-mediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat choice has important implications for population management and conservation."

Individuals with `fast' lifestyles should develop faster, reproduce earlier, exhibit more risk-prone behaviours, and die sooner than those with `slow' lifestyles. While support for POLS has been equivocal to date, studies have relied on individual-level (phenotypic) patterns in which genetic trade-offs may be masked by environmental effects on phenotypes. We estimated genetic correlations between life history (development, lifespan, size) and risky behaviours (exploration, aggression) in a pedigreed population of Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Path analyses showed that behaviours mediated some genetic relationships between life history traits, though not those involved in trade-offs. Thus, while specific predictions of POLS theory were not supported, genetic integration of behaviour and life history was present. This implies a major role for risky behaviours in life history evolution."

Recent advances in animal personality research have established the ecological importance of the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by individuals and by multispecies communities. Here, we examine the degree to which the multidimensional behavioural volume of a group predicts the outcome of both intra-and interspecific interactions. In particular, we test the hypothesis that a population of conspecifics will experience low intraspecific competition when the population occupies a large volume in behavioural space. We further hypothesize that populations of interacting species will exhibit greater interspecific competition when one or both species occupy large volumes in behavioural space. We evaluate these hypotheses by studying groups of katydids (Scudderia nymphs) and froghoppers (Philaenus spumarius), which compete for food and space on their shared host plant, Solidago canadensis. We found that individuals in single-species groups of katydids positioned themselves closer to one another, suggesting reduced competition, when groups occupied a large behavioural volume. When both species were placed together, we found that the survival of froghoppers was greatest when both froghoppers and katydids occupied a small volume in behavioural space, particularly at high froghopper densities. These results suggest that groups that occupy large behavioural volumes can have low intraspecific competition but high interspecific competition. Thus, behavioural hypervolumes appear to have ecological consequences at both the level of the population and the community and may help to predict the intensity of competition both within and across species.

Population-level syndromes can appear maladaptive, such as when prey remain active across the absence and presence of a sit-and-wait predator. Yet in nature, individuals often vary in syndrome adherence, exhibiting individual-level differences in behavioural plasticity. Here, I use an experiment to show that individual behavioural plasticity (a reduction in activity level in the presence of predation threat) increases a prey's likelihood of surviving predator exposure, and further predicts survival better than single-context activity level measures. In an additional experiment, I identify conditioning (nonlethal predator exposure) as a process that reduces prey activity level. This work demonstrates that although population-level behavioural syndromes can appear maladaptive, behavioural plasticity and conditioning could potentially ameliorate negative effects at the individual level.

Offering variety in feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals' exploration of different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0 to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits. These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd."

However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length, mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25) that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of information can be conveyed to the receivers. Significance statement We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because individuals that changed residency between days sang with less consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers."

We investigated the possible link between personality traits and learning performance in the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops. Exploratory activity, sociability, and aggression were assessed twice in ant foragers. Behaviors differed among individuals, they were partly repeatable across time and exploratory activity correlated positively with aggression. Learning abilities were quantified by differential conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response, a task that requires cue perception and information storage. We found that exploratory activity of individual ants significantly predicted learning performance: ``active-explorers{''} were slower in learning the task than ``inactive-explorers{''}.

Such personality-specific task participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving group performance. While several recent studies have documented group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality) diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape social organization, individual performance, and group success."

Experiences made during early ontogeny can shape the degree of behavioural flexibility maintained by individuals during later life. In natural habitats, animals are exposed to a multitude of social and non-social ecological factors during early ontogeny, but their relative influences on future learning ability and behavioural flexibility are only poorly understood. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we investigated whether early social and predator experiences shape the learning performance, flexibility, and response to novelty of adults. Fish were reared either with or without parents and helpers and with or without perceived predation risk in a full-factorial experiment. We investigated the influence of these treatments on learning performance and flexibility in a spatial acquisition and reversal learning task. To test for response to novelty, we performed a neophobia test. We found that fish reared with predator experience, but without the presence of older group members outperformed fish with other rearing backgrounds in reversal learning and that individuals, which had been reared in a socially more complex environment together with older group members responded less neophobic toward a novel object than individuals reared among siblings only. Comparative evidence from fish and rats suggests that these developmental effects may be driven by the cues of safety perceived in the presence of guarding parents."

Host sociality is known to impact parasite risk with more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2years at a site in southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality. More exploratory individuals hosted a greater abundance of ectoparasites compared to less exploratory individuals. Our results are consistent with past studies implicating personality as a factor in host-parasite dynamics and suggest that exploration may be an important behavioral correlate of parasite acquisition."

Agonistic experience is also discussed as a potential cause of consistent, behavioral differences between individuals (animal ``personality{''}). In non-mammals, however, the impact of single agonistic encounters typically last only hours, but then again studies of repeated intermittent defeat (chronic social defeat) are seldom. We report the effect of chronic social defeat in adult male crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), for which all known behavioral effects of defeat last only 3 h. Firstly, after 48 h social isolation, crickets that experienced 5 defeats at 24 h intervals against the same, weight-matched opponent exhibited suppressed aggressiveness lasting > 24 h, which was still evident when the animals were matched against an unfamiliar opponent at the last trial. Secondly, this longer-term depression of aggression also occurred in 48 h isolated crickets that lost 6 fights at 1 h intervals against unfamiliar opponents at each trial. Thirdly, crickets isolated as larvae until adult maturity (> 16 days) were significantly more aggressive, and less variable in their aggressiveness at their very first fight than 48 h isolates, and also significantly more resilient to the effects of chronic social defeat. We conclude that losing an aggressive encounter in crickets has a residual effect, lasting at least 24 h, that accumulates when repeated defeats are experienced, and leads to a prolonged depression of aggressive motivation in subordinates. Furthermore, our data indicate that social interactions between young adults and possibly larvae can have even longer, possibly lifelong influences on subsequent behavior. Social subjugation is thus likely to be a prime determinant of inter-individual behavioral differences in crickets. Our work also opens new avenues for investigating proximate mechanisms underlying depression-like phenomena."

Recent work combining animal personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels relative to those with slower life history strategies, but empirical tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials. Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors, such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges. Thus, we offer evidence that behaviour is an important component of co-evolved suites of traits forming a general pace -of-life continuum in this system."

In both experiments, we examined the consistency of individual male reproductive behaviour across two repeated trials on the same day. Males did not exhibit a courtship preference for the larger female in either experiment, but, in experiment 1, males did exhibit post-copulatory choice by copulating for longer durations with the large female, and males that mated with the same type of female in both trials exhibited repeatable behaviour. In general, we found weak evidence of consistent male courtship behaviour in the presence of behaving females. However, when female behaviour was controlled in experiment 2, we found that male courtship behaviour was highly repeatable.

Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny. The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However, the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare. Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation, albeit at different time points in males and females. This period of the life cycle merits systematic examination across taxa."

Two integral, but infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e., uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using observations of aggression in four age classes (4-10 months, 10 months-3 years, 3-6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N = 4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; TuckerLewis index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303). However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus, sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because inaccurate ``aggressive personality{''} trait attributions can be costly to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general."

Personality of 2,802 pet cats, from South Australia and New Zealand, was rated by their owners utilising a survey measuring 52 personality traits. Five reliable personality factors were found using principal axis factor analysis: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Dominance, Impulsiveness and Agreeableness. Implications for the `Feline Five' are discussed in relation to their potential application to improving the management and welfare of pet cats. Highly Impulsive cats for example, may be reacting to something stressful in their environment, whereas cats with low Agreeableness scores, showing irritability may indicate underlying pain or illness. Thus, the need for a systematic and holistic approach to personality that includes both the individual pet cat and its environment is recommended, and opens the door to future interdisciplinary intervention."

Another important and related question is whether RNs are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and food availability that were repeated in discrete `bursts' of sampling through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time for both temperature (R-slope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses (R-slope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment (R-intercept = 0.83).

We studied how four boldness-related traits and swimming escape performance covary and shape the probability of survival and autotomy of Ischnura pumilio damselfly larvae in an experiment with predatory dragonfly larvae. Our results did not support the common belief that bold individuals are selected against in terms of survival selection by predation. Instead, we found survival selection favouring individuals combining being bold for two boldness-related traits. The four boldness-related traits did not covary frequently, supporting the multidimensionality of boldness. Moreover, animals bolder for one trait (activity in the presence of predator cues) were shyer for another trait (response to predator cues), which indicated trait compensation. However, the support for trait compensation was limited. The only other case of trait compensation was that bold larvae compensated for their increased risk-taking behaviour in the presence of a predator with a higher probability of autotomy. These patterns may contribute to maintaining variation in boldness in damselfly populations. Just as boldness-related traits are multidimensional, the mechanisms underlying their persistence in natural populations are also likely to be multifaceted.

Such individual differences may represent adaptations. Recently, researchers have started to implement the same adaptive framework to individual differences in cognition, leading to the suggestion that personality and cognition should covary. To determine the contextual consistency of cognitive traits and their covariation with several personality traits, 24 guinea pigs, Cavia aperea f. porcellus, were tested using a battery of 12 cognitive tests. Four tests each were conducted to test for problem solving, association learning and social learning. We assessed consistency within each of these three domains and tested for cognitive and behavioural syndromes between domains. Problem solving and social learning were consistent across contexts and positively correlated with each other. In addition, both correlated positively with boldness, and problem solving showed a negative correlation with aggressiveness and sociopositive behaviour. Association learning was neither consistent nor correlated with personality or performance in the other cognition tasks. We showed contextual consistency of two cognitive traits and found multiple links to personality traits that were predicted by recent theory. Surprisingly, associative learning was not consistent, demonstrating the importance of testing the relation between personality and multiple cognitive traits to increase our understanding of individual variation in cognition and personality.

However, capture, marking and manipulation can dramatically alter the animals' behaviour after capture, and thus affect subsequent recapture success. Here, we used a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population as an example to illustrate the sampling bias resulting from the repeated capture of free-ranging individuals. By using repeated measures of the same individuals obtained during our long-term survey, we specifically evaluated the interannual response of breeding adults to capture-related stress, measured as latency to enter nestboxes equipped with a swing-trap. Moreover, we examined changes in the mean and variance of bird age with varying trapping effort using subsamples of the data set. Birds without any previous trapping experience entered nests more quickly than experienced ones, after controlling for other factors affecting latency, such as the sex, offspring quality and the order of capture relative to the other pair member. Birds' reluctance to enter the nest furthermore increased as the number of captures in previous years accumulated, implying that individual pied flycatchers became progressively more difficult to capture over the course of the study. Our results indicate that repeated exposure to capture stress over an animal's lifetime may induce long-lasting behavioural modifications that may influence trappability of the older segments of the population. We also provide evidence that this may ultimately lead to sampling bias towards younger ages, especially when effort is limited. We conclude that systematic age bias due to trapping experience can have important implications for the estimation of variation in a range of traits and should therefore be carefully checked in longitudinal studies.

Several terms are used to describe this variation, including animal personality and coping style. Both terms describe between individual consistency in behavioural variation; however, they differ in the behavioural assays typically used, the expected distribution of response variables, and whether they incorporate variation in behavioural flexibility. Despite these differences, the terms are often used interchangeably. We conducted experiments using juvenile and adult red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, as subjects to explore the degree to which animal personality and coping styles overlap. We demonstrate that animal personality and coping styles can be described in this species, and that shyer individuals had more flexible responses, as expected for coping styles. Behavioural responses from both personality and coping style assays had continuous distributions, and were not clearly separated into two types. Behavioural traits were not correlated and, hence, there was no evidence of a behavioural syndrome. Further, behavioural responses obtained in personality assays did not correlate with those from coping style tests. Animal personality and coping styles are therefore not synonymous in the red junglefowl. We suggest that the terms animal personality and coping style are not equivalent and should not be used interchangeably. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

With binary, irreversible elements of state, such as mating status, there may be optimal behavioral phenotypes before and after mating, with individuals often prioritizing mate acquisition before and resource acquisition after. Yet, limited plasticity may prevent optimal behavior in both contexts. Additionally, it remains largely unknown if some consistencies in neural or physiological traits may limit the ability of the organism to respond to state changes. In this study, we investigated how changes in a binary state variable, mating status, affected both the mean expression and amongindividual variation in behavior and web structure of the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti. Furthermore, we explored the role of biogenic amines in potentially mediating individual differences in behavior and web structure. We found that mated females were overall more aggressive than virgin females and also built webs structured primarily for capturing prey rather than safety. We also found that individual differences in behavior and web structure were maintained across mating statuses, which indicates the stability of these traits and may drive personality-specific state-dependent fitness trade-offs. Finally, we found that aggressive spiders had higher central nervous system dopamine levels. Interestingly, web structure was often correlated with a catabolite of tyramine (N-acetyltyramine), suggesting that variation in amine catabolism, and not the concentrations of the amines themselves, may drive individual differences in some traits. Significance statement Our results demonstrate that although individuals show plasticity in response to changes in state, specifically mating status, individuals also maintain among-individual differences across this state change. Thus, aggressive individuals before mating will tend to be aggressive after. This maintenance of individual differences across state may drive differential fitness benefits before and after mating for different behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that biogenic amines and their catabolites are related to individual differences, thus identifying a potential mechanism underlying consistent variation."

In social species, we must not only explore how individuals respond to variations in the physical environment but also how they react to changes in their social environment. A growing body of work has demonstrated that the behavioural heterogeneity of a group can alter its responsiveness, decision making, and fitness. Whether an individual is more or less extreme than a partner - what we term its `relative personality' - may also alter individual behavioural responses. We determined exploratory tendencies of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio) and then constructed pairs with varying differences in `relative personality' to determine the effect of differences between partners on behavioural plasticity. We find that relative personality, but not the magnitude of the difference between partners, is the most important determinant of behavioural plasticity across social treatments. Despite this overall effect, pairs of fish exhibited no predictable leader follower interactions, suggesting that details of the experimental paradigm may be important in shaping social dynamics.

Evidence suggests that personality may influence learning and memory; a finding that could improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes that produce and maintain intraspecific behavioural heterogeneity. Here, we tested whether boldness, the most studied personality trait in fish, could predict learning ability in brook trout. After quantifying boldness, fish were trained to find a hidden food patch in a maze environment. Stable landmark cues were provided to indicate the location of food and, at the conclusion of training, cues were rearranged to test for learning. There was a negative relationship between boldness and learning as shy fish were increasingly more successful at navigating the maze and locating food during training trials compared to bold fish. In the altered testing environment, only shy fish continued using cues to search for food. Overall, the learning rate of bold fish was found to be lower than that of shy fish for several metrics suggesting that personality could have widespread effects on behaviour. Because learning can increase plasticity to environmental change, these results have significant implications for fish conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

One means of learning about mates socially is to attend to other members of one's sex and copy their mate choices. It is possible however that not all individuals of a species benefit equally from, or are equally effective at, copying. We examined whether female guppies copied the mate choices of other females. Then, in a separate context we measured each female's `sociability': their proclivity to affiliate with other guppies. In the mate-choice copying procedure, `focal' females chose to spend time near two putative mates. Next, focals observed another (model) female interact with the focal's non-preferred male. Finally, the focal again chose between the same two males. For sociability, we examined the time focal females spent near a trio of other guppies. Females did indeed mate copy: they spent more time with their non-preferred male when a model female had been seen interacting with that male. The effect however was highly variable. Sociability significantly predicted the intensity of mate-choice copying. Results suggest that individuals vary consistently in the types of information they use when making mating decisions.

These hypotheses particularly expect bolder individuals to be faster, but less accurate, as a trade-off in cognitive function. However, cognitive processes are typically interconnected and defined in more complex terms than simply speed and accuracy. Here, we present evidence that personality-based differences in learning rates are a result of differences in decision-making during training in a two-alternative forced-choice spatial memory task. This was examined in the mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii in the presence of light, where both vision and the electric sense are available, and in the dark, where visibility is limited and fish rely mostly on electrosensing. The species is adapted for the dark to avoid visual predators; thus, the presence of light can induce high-risk and the dark low-risk. We show that light conditions had little effect on learning, with bolder fish learning faster both in the light and in the dark conditions. Yet the relationship between learning rates and error rates indicates that the effect on learning is indirectly influenced by accuracy during training. Speed-accuracy trade-offs were not found in decision-making, with bolder individuals deciding faster and more accurately both in the light and in the dark. Only learning strategy was affected by light conditions, with significantly more fish preferring response to place learning in the dark than in the light, where distal cues were not visible. We conclude that other than effects from the integration of visual information, bolder individuals show a consistently greater tendency to explore and find food rewards during training. This affects their decision-making and in turn their learning performance. We highlight the complexity by which personality-based effects are exhibited in spatial associative learning."

These are exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their implementation."

Differences among groups in their phenotypic composition, such as their average phenotype, within-group variation in phenotype, or the phenotype of individuals occupying key social roles might shape the mating system emerging at the group level and explain some portion of mating system variability. Here, we take advantage of the mating system flexibility of stream water striders (Aquarius remigis) to investigate how phenotypic composition affects the mating system emerging at the group level. Groups exhibited stable mating systems varying from scramble polygyny with intense sexual conflict, to systems with a clear dominant male guarding a ``harem{''} of females. We found that male size asymmetries and the personality of the largest individuals within groups had important effects on the group's mating system.

Here, we used the pace-of-life hypothesis to predict how behavioral syndromes could vary along climatic gradients. This hypothesis states that populations experiencing different ecological conditions should differ in suites of physiological characteristics associated with behavioral and life-history traits. We examined the persistence of behavioral syndromes at multiple levels in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus along a climatic gradient in north-eastern USA. ``Across populations{''}, we predicted that proactive phenotypes, which show higher activity, aggression and exploration, are more likely to persist in warmer climates. ``Within populations{''}, we expected positive associations among proactive behaviors to be more pronounced at warmer sites. Additionally, we measured colony productivity to test whether deviation from the population-level syndrome influences their success, and whether such deviations could vary among populations. Behavioral syndromes clearly occurred across populations, with colonies from warmer environments exhibiting more exploration and foraging but slightly less aggressiveness than colonies from colder sites. However, the presence of behavioral syndromes within sites was population-specific. Positive associations between foraging, exploration and aggression, albeit rarely found, were more pronounced at the warmest sites, whereas negative associations were more common at colder sites. Furthermore, colonies from colder environments showed higher syndrome deviations than colonies from warmer environments, which may be linked to resource limitation and may also negatively affect colony productivity. This study partially corroborates the pace-of-life hypothesis and yields insights into the adaptive value of behavioral syndromes along climatic gradients."

Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality.

However, examining the variation in behaviour among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk), (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness and IN in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant differences in IIV among different individuals within the population. Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IW in their boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results definitively demonstrate that IN itself varies across individuals and is linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for behavioural interactions."

Innate personality traits are supposedly less evident in animals when confounded by learning acquired with experience through time. Learning might play a key role in the development and adoption of successful anti-predator strategies, and the related adaptation has the potential to make animals that are more experienced less vulnerable to predation. We carried out a study in a system involving a large herbivorous mammal, female elk, Cervus elaphus, and their primary predator, i. e., human hunters. Using fine-scale satellite telemetry relocations, we tested whether differences in behaviour depending on age were due solely to selection pressure imposed by human hunters, meaning that females that were more cautious were more likely to survive and become older. Or whether learning also was involved, meaning that females adjusted their behaviour as they aged. Our results indicated that both human selection and learning contributed to the adoption of more cautious behavioural strategies in older females. Whereas human selection of behavioural traits has been shown in our previous research, we here provide evidence of additive learning processes being responsible for shaping the behaviour of individuals in this population. Female elk are indeed almost invulnerable to human hunters when older than 9 +/- 10 y. o., confirming that experience contributes to their survival. Female elk monitored in our study showed individually changing behaviours and clear adaptation as they aged, such as reduced movement rates (decreased likelihood of encountering human hunters), and increased use of secure areas (forest and steeper terrain), especially when close to roads. We also found that elk adjusted behaviours depending on the type of threat (bow and arrow vs. rifle hunters). This fine-tuning by elk to avoid hunters, rather than just becoming more cautious during the hunting season, highlights the behavioural plasticity of this species. Selection on behavioural traits and/or behavioural shifts via learning are an important but often-ignored consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Such information is a critical component of the effects of human exploitation of wildlife populations with implications for improving their management and conservation."

Few studies have investigated the significance of the social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations.

It has been measured using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation. Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature). During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions) after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures, supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Individual propensity for transient mating attempts was not significantly repeatable and did not significantly predict reproductive success or somatic cost during the mating season. Individuals varied consistently in FID, and although repeatable, FID was not related to reproductive success or somatic cost.

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions has been proposed to maintain such variation but empirical evidences supporting this hypothesis are still scarce for behavioural traits. Here, we analysed the repeatability and the ecological and individual factors that influence the expression of docility across different environmental contexts in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) studied over a period of 10 years. We also estimated the heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age, was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at 0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only, individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival. Our study confirms that docility is both phenotypically and genetically variables and that disruptive selection might maintain the variability in this trait. Significance statement Documenting the factors allowing the maintenance of phenotypic and genetic variation of behavioural traits within natural populations is a central objective in ecology and evolution. Here, we studied a wild eastern chipmunk population over 10 years and recorded docility, a personality trait, on both juveniles and adults. We showed that docility was repeatable and that it was also heritable and influenced by different individual and environmental factors. Importantly, we also found that disruptive viability selection was acting on adult docility independently of environmental variations. Our results show that docility is both phenotypically and genetically variable and that patterns of selection acting on this trait can maintain personality heterogeneity across temporally varying environmental conditions in the wild."

The attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency) and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables measured in various tests with different contexts over several life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour is differentially consistent, the structure can change."

However, it has not been studied up to now whether this dimension also exists in other species. SPS can influence how people perceive the environment and how this affects them, thus a similar dimension in animals would be highly relevant with respect to animal welfare. We therefore explored whether SPS translates to dogs, one of the primary model species in personality research. A 32-item questionnaire to assess the ``highly sensitive dog score{''} (HSD-s) was developed based on the ``highly sensitive person{''} (HSP) questionnaire. A large-scale, international online survey was conducted, including the HSD questionnaire, as well as questions on fearfulness, neuroticism, ``demographic{''} (e.g. dog sex, age, weight; age at adoption, etc.) and ``human{''} factors (e.g. owner age, sex, profession, communication style, etc.), and the HSP questionnaire. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effect models with forward stepwise selection to test prediction of HSD-s by the above-mentioned factors, with country of residence and dog breed treated as random effects. A total of 3647 questionnaires were fully completed. HSD-, fearfulness, neuroticism and HSP-scores showed good internal consistencies, and HSD-s only moderately correlated with fearfulness and neuroticism scores, paralleling previous findings in humans. Intra- (N = 447) and inter-rater (N = 120) reliabilities were good. Demographic and human factors, including HSP score, explained only a small amount of the variance of HSD-s. A PCA analysis identified three subtraits of SPS, comparable to human findings. Overall, the measured personality dimension in dogs showed good internal consistency, partial independence from fearfulness and neuroticism, and good intra-and inter-rater reliability, indicating good construct validity of the HSD questionnaire. Human and demographic factors only marginally affected the HSD-s suggesting that, as hypothesized for human SPS, a genetic basis may underlie this dimension within the dog species."

Stability over time is a central tenet of personality; ecological pressures experienced by an individual at different life stages may, however, vary considerably, which may have a significant effect on behavioural traits. Invertebrates often go through numerous discrete developmental stages and therefore provide a useful model for such research. Here we test for both differential consistency and age effects upon behavioural traits in the gregarious cockroach Diploptera punctata by testing the same behavioural traits in both juveniles and adults. In our sample, we find consistency in boldness, exploration and sociality within adults whilst only boldness was consistent in juveniles. Both boldness and exploration measures, representative of risk-taking behaviour, show significant consistency across discrete juvenile and adult stages. Age effects are, however, apparent in our data; juveniles are significantly bolder than adults, most likely due to differences in the ecological requirements of these life stages. Size also affects risk-taking behaviour since smaller adults are both bolder and more highly explorative. Whilst a behavioural syndrome linking boldness and exploration is evident in nymphs, this disappears by the adult stage, where links between other behavioural traits become apparent. Our results therefore indicate that differential consistency in personality can be maintained across life stages despite age effects on its magnitude, with links between some personality traits changing over ontogeny, demonstrating plasticity in behavioural syndromes."

One crucial variable is the presence/absence of conspecifics. For animals usually reared in groups, social isolation after birth or hatching can be a highly stressful circumstance, with potentially long-lasting consequences. Here, we assessed the effects of social deprivation (isolation) early in life, that is, absence of conspecifics, versus social enrichment, that is, presence of conspecifics, on developmental time, body size at maturity, mating behaviour and groupliving in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Socially deprived protonymphs developed more slowly and were less socially competent in grouping behaviour than socially enriched protonymphs. Compromised social competence in grouping behaviour was evident in decreased activity, fewer mutual encounters and larger interindividual distances, all of which may entail severe fitness costs. In female choice/male competition, socially deprived males mated earlier than socially enriched males; in male choice/female competition, socially deprived females were more likely to mate than socially enriched females. In neither mate choice situation did mating duration or body size at maturity differ between socially deprived and enriched mating opponents. Social isolation-induced shifts in mating behaviour may be interpreted as increased attractiveness or competitiveness or, more likely, as hastiness and reduced ability to assess mate quality. Overall, many of the social isolation-induced behavioural changes in P. persimilis are analogous to those observed in other animals such as cockroaches, fruit flies, fishes or rodents. We argue that, due to their profound and persistent effects, early social deprivation or enrichment may be important determinants in shaping animal personalities. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

It is still not entirely understood, however, how different personalities evolve and persist. The social niche specialization hypothesis suggests that in group-living animals the combination of social conflicts and alternative options on how to deal with them are of key importance for the development and evolution of animal personality. Here we predicted that, following the social niche specialization hypothesis, a more social species should have more pronounced personality differences. We tested this prediction using four species of shrews that differ in ecology and sociability. Three species (Neomys fodiens, Sorex araneus and Sorex minutus) are strictly solitary outside the breeding season; the fourth species (Neomys anomalus) is intraspecifically more tolerant and able to live in groups. These four species offer a good model to assess our questions as N. anomalus can, in many other respects (e.g. body size, habitat, foraging mode), be considered as an `inbetween' species. We tested individuals of all species for their solitary activity and their activity and agonistic behaviour in within- and between-species dyadic encounters. We found that individuals of N. anomalus, but not the other species tested, showed consistent behavioural variation in agonistic behaviour. Consistent individual differences in activity were, however, also present in other species and activity was further correlated between the different contexts in all tested species. Finding more pronounced personality differences in N. anomalus than in the other, less sociable species supports the hypothesis that social niche specialization can influence the evolution of animal personalities.

This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration. This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in which only part of a population migrates while the other remains resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species. Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S. selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus. The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between migratory and resident flies. They also provide evidence for the possible role of behavioural differences in influencing partial migration decisions within populations. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In fact, it is the evolutionary context that differentiates behavioral ecology from ethology and animal behavior, 2 fields that were already concerned with the study of behavior in nonhuman animals. So, if behavioral ecology already takes an evolutionary approach to variation in behavior, we ask what is personality research about exactly? This question is particularly pertinent now the focus of personality research shifts and the field moves away from being mainly descriptive to include quantitative frameworks. As a result, the field has come to borrow heavily from already established fields. In our view, this has resulted in ``animal personality{''} studies becoming nothing more than a rebranding of existing fields of research-fields that are far more solidly grounded and hypothesis driven than the often vague and superficial focus on animal personalities."

To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon, enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4 behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance). This study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird."

Wheels are common environmental enrichment for laboratory rodents, but studies conflict on how this influences behavior, and interaction of wheels with individual personalities has rarely been examined. We examined whether wheel access altered personality profiles in adult Siberian dwarf hamsters. We assayed animals in a tunnel maze twice for baseline personality, then again at two and at seven weeks after the experimental group was provisioned with wheels in their home cages. Linear mixed model selection was used to assess changes in behavior over time and across environmental gradient of wheel exposure. While animals showed consistent inter-individual differences in activity, activity personality did not change upon exposure to a wheel. Boldness also varies among individuals, and there is evidence for female boldness scores converging after wheel exposure, that is, opposite shifts in behavior by high and low boldness individuals, although sample size is too small for the mixed model results to be robust. In general, Siberian dwarf hamsters appear to show low behavioral plasticity, particularly in general activity, in response to running wheels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size."

Consistent differences between individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals' states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different conspecifics with which individuals associated (their `choosiness' of social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more selective about group members when there was more food, and when they were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences exist among females in this population, and females' measures of sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals' states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females' patterns of sociability over shorter periods.

We investigated the existence of consistent individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue for the study of animal personality in the wild.

Recently, the notion that life history studies should integrate animal behaviour has emerged, because between-individual differences in behaviour are often coupled with fitness differences. So far, studies have mainly focused on interspecies or interpopulation perspectives, and research on the effects of life history differences on individual behaviour remain scarce. In the present study we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how pace of life is related to consistent individual behaviour. We investigated the relationship between developmental speed and consistent behaviour of the field wolf spider, Pardosa agrestis. In this species, individuals originating from the same clutch can typically follow either a slow or a rapid developmental pathway, characterized by a developmental time of about 10 or 3 months, respectively. We found that spiders, regardless of their developmental speed, behaved consistently in most of the tests. Our results also show that individuals developing rapidly were significantly more active during exploration and more successful in prey-catching tests than slowly developing spiders. Although rapidly developing spiders were bolder in one of the tests, this difference did not persist over the repeated measurements. Our work seems to support the notion that pace of life and animal personality are correlated, and pace of life might predict the behavioural types of individuals.

The pattern of assortative mating for behavioural type is thus often interpreted as resulting from a mate choice process. However, an alternative process is also possible when the partners become similar through postpairing adjustments (behavioural convergence). The disentanglement of these two nonexclusive mechanisms is an important evolutionary question. Only sexual selection based on behavioural similarity before pairing can explain the maintenance of the behavioural type variability. In a previous study, we reported the existence of behavioural convergence for aggressiveness between partners in convict cichlids Amatitlania siquia, a monogamous tropical fish. We tested herein the assumption of mate choice based on behavioural similarity for aggressiveness using either short-term binary choice or long-term group level pairing. Pairing was not based on behavioural similarity between potential partners. Choosing a behaviourally compatible partner is a complex task because it requires profiling the potential mates. Individuals would thus achieve higher fitness benefits from choosing a partner on more conspicuous criteria (such as size for instance) and then attempt to increase partner similarity by convergence after pairing. Sexual selection does not appear to drive the maintenance of aggressiveness type variability in convict cichlids. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

This difficulty can arise because the behaviour of captive-reared animals differs from wild animals. Whilst the effect of captivity on animal behaviour has been widely reported, few studies have explicitly compared differences between captive-reared and wild-caught animals. Even fewer have examined behavioural types (a composition of behavioural traits) displayed in novel environments, which is particularly relevant for determining reintroduction success. Further, the transgenerational effects on behavioural type, and potential differences between sexes in response to captivity, remain almost completely unknown. Using house mouse (Mus musculus) as a model for small mammals, we tested whether behavioural types displayed in a novel environment differed between captive-reared and wild-caught animals. In addition, it was tested whether behavioural types were subject to transgenerational effects in captivity, and whether there were sex-specific differences in behavioural types. We used an open field test to simulate a novel environment. Captive-reared mice were found to differ in their boldness and activity behavioural type compared to their wild-caught mice (p < 0.001). There was marginal evidence for transgenerational effects on behavioural type in captivity, but three behavioural traits displayed a shift away from wild behaviours (\% Time active: p < 0.001; \% Time mobile: p = 0.004; Centre: maximum speed: p = 0.004). Furthermore, behavioural types of individuals in captivity did not differ depending on sex (F-0: p = 0.161; F-1: p = 0.665), however behavioural type did differ between wild-caught females and males (p = 0.015).

Previous research suggests metabolic rate as a potential proximate mechanism to explain behavioural covariation. We measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR), boldness and exploration in western stutter-trilling crickets, Gryllus integer, selected differentially for short and fast development over two generations. After applying mixed-effects models to reveal the sign of the covariation, we applied structural equation models to an individual-level covariance matrix to examine whether the RMR generates covariation between the measured behaviours. All traits showed among-individual variation and covariation: RMR and boldness were positively correlated, RMR and exploration were negatively correlated, and boldness and exploration were negatively correlated. However, the RMR was not a causal factor generating covariation between boldness and exploration. Instead, the covariation between all three traits was explained by another, unmeasured mechanism. The selection lines differed from each other in all measured traits and significantly affected the covariance matrix structure between the traits, suggesting that there is a genetic component in the trait integration. Our results emphasize that interpretations made solely from the correlation matrix might be misleading."

The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts that habitat-specific selective pressures will favor the coevolution of personality, physiological, and life-history phenotypes. Few studies so far have compared these traits simultaneously across different ecological conditions. In this study, we compared 3 personality traits (handling aggression, exploration speed in a novel environment, and nest defense behavior) and 1 physiological trait (heart rate during manual restraint) across 3 Corsican blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) populations. These populations are located in contrasting habitats (evergreen vs. deciduous) and are situated in 2 different valleys 25 km apart. Birds from these populations are known to differ in life-history characteristics, with birds from the evergreen habitat displaying a slow pace-of-life, and birds from the deciduous habitat a comparatively faster pace-of-life. We expected personality to differ across populations, in line with the differences in pace-of-life documented for life-history traits. As expected, we found behavioral differences among populations. Despite considerable temporal variation, birds exhibited lower handling aggression in the evergreen populations. Exploration speed and male heart rate also differed across populations, although our results for exploration speed were more consistent with a phenotypic difference between the 2 valleys than between habitats. There were no clear differences in nest defense intensity among populations. Our study emphasizes the role of environmental heterogeneity in shaping population divergence in personality traits at a small spatial scale."

However, consistent interindividual differences in cognitive styles remain largely unexplored. Individual differences in cognitive styles are hypothesized to be functionally related to differences in personality types. It is assumed that proactive individuals make faster decisions at the expense of accuracy (i.e., the speed-accuracy trade-offs hypothesis). Here, we investigated the relationship between personality and speed-accuracy trade-off using Portia labiata, a specialized spider-eating jumping spider that exhibits excellent cognitive ability. We first established consistent individual differences in aggressiveness and decision-making in P. labiata. We then tested whether individual differences in aggressiveness could predict how fast and accurately P. labiata makes a prey-choice decision (a large vs. a small orb-web spider). We demonstrated that P. labiata exhibited individual differences not only in aggressiveness, but also in the speed of prey-choice decisions but not in the choices. Importantly, we found that aggressiveness was not related to the choice of the prey, but it predicted the speed of prey-choice decision: aggressive individuals were faster to make choices than docile ones but both chose large spiders as preferred prey. This suggests a lack of an association between a speed-accuracy trade-off and variation in personality types of P. labiata."

Here we tested the idea that polygynous males exhibit predictable variation in risk-taking during intense competition for mates. We conducted an observational study of a village weaverbird (Ploceus cucullatus) breeding colony, and video recorded synchronous fleeing events, a common predator avoidance behavior. Males adjusted their flight from the colony according to the amplitude (loudness) and Wiener entropy (harshness) of conspecific alarm calls during a perceived threat. Males also varied in how often they fled the colony. Specifically, in line with predictions based on the value of a male's territory, males with more nesting females were less likely to flee, and returned sooner if they did flee, compared to males with fewer nesting females. Males with a nest under construction also returned to their nests sooner than males without constructions in progress, consistent with predictions based on nest sabotage by conspecifics. These results suggest that male weavers perform a cost-benefit analysis in real time in order to decide how to respond to a perceived threat, with self-protection trading off with the security of one's territory and mates."

In contrast, behavioral syndromes are commonly recognized when documented on the phenotypic level, which is a mix of between- individual and residual (within-individual) correlations. Phenotypic and between- individual correlations need not align, and investigations on different levels of the same syndrome may hence lead to opposite inferences. Between-individual correlations, arguably, provide stronger evidence for an intrinsically determined behavioral syndrome than phenotypic correlations. We compiled 109 literature estimates of between- individual and phenotypic correlations between behaviors from 30 studies, performed on 22 species covering a wide range of taxa. Contrary to our expectation, the phenotypic correlation in behaviors was, on average, a reasonable predictor of the between- individual correlation in terms of magnitude and sign. Although our finding does not warrant the use of the phenotypic correlation as a suitable approximation of the between- individual correlation for any particular study, it does suggest that the phenotypic correlations used to infer the majority of behavioral syndromes to date have provided a reasonable characterization of syndrome associative strength."

According to coping styles theory, proactive individuals are bolder, less reactive to stressors, and more routinized than their reactive counterparts. A key tenet of coping styles theory is that variation in coping styles is maintained by tradeoffs with behavioral flexibility: proactive individuals excel in stable environments while more flexible, reactive individuals perform better in variable environments. Here, we assess evidence for coping styles within a natural population of threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We developed a criterion-based learning paradigm to evaluate individual variation in initial and reversal learning. We observed strong individual differences in boldness, cortisol production, and learning performance. Consistent with coping styles, fish that released more cortisol were more timid in response to a predator attack and slower to learn a color discrimination task. However, there was no evidence that reactive individuals performed better when the environment changed (when the rewarded color was reversed). The failure to detect trade-offs between behavioral routinization and flexibility prompts other explanations for the maintenance of differing coping styles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Allometric scaling of SMR with body mass was similar among the species, but C. porosus had significantly higher SMR than did C. johnsoni or A. mississippiensis. Differences in SMR among species are potentially related to behavioural differences in levels of aggression; C. porosus are the most aggressive of the crocodilians measured, and have rates of standard metabolism that are approximately 36\% higher at the grand mean body size than those measured for C. johnsoni or A. mississippiensis, which are among the least aggressive crocodilians."

Colonies of the spider Anelosimus studiosus appear to have responded to this pressure by evolving the ability to maintain mixtures of docile versus aggressive individuals that help colonies avoid extinction. Here we demonstrate that colony extinction events unite the optimal group composition of all colony constituents, regardless of phenotype, with that of the colony as a whole. This is because colony extinction events explain the majority of individual mortality events in A. studiosus. Through within-and across-habitat colony manipulations, we further determined that reduction in reproductive output by individuals bearing overabundant phenotypes underlies the ability of colonies to adaptively regulate their compositions. When we experimentally created colonies with an overabundance of the docile or aggressive phenotype, individuals bearing the overabundant phenotype exhibited reduced reproductive output, which helped to move colony compositions back towards their site-specific optima. Colonies displaced from their native sites continued to recreate the patterns of reproductive output that characterized their site of origin, suggesting a genetic component to this trait. Individuals thus appear to adaptively cull their reproductive output depending on their phenotype and the composition of their colony. There is also considerable parent-offspring colony resemblance in the extent to which colonies can or do track their ideal compositions. This conveys a kind of collective heritability to this trait. Together, while group selection appears to be the principal driver of ongoing selection on group composition in A. studiosus, patterns of selection among individuals within groups appear to promote colonies' ability to track their ideal mixtures.

Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (NT) and Black-chinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (BCT) are respectively characterized by fast growth and water salinity tolerance which attract the breeders who could take advantage of both species. The first step is to characterize both species behavior in different contexts. The aim of this study was to compare the self-feeding behaviour between NT and BCT with a design allowing to reveal individual and group feed demand behaviour and then to identify the individual specialization that builds around the device and the Mod dispenser. The second objective was to estimate the links between the individual specialization and personality traits. To this aim, we recorded feed demand behaviour of both species using a computerized self-feeding device (two tanks for each species containing 20 PIT-tagged individuals with a male-female ratio of about 47\%). Personality traits of all individuals were subsequently characterized with an open field test (OFT). The links between feed-demand and personality were then analyzed. Growth performances were not significantly different between NT and BCT but there was a strong tank effect. The individual specialization was similar in NT and BCT and,similar to that previously observed in sea bass i.e. 1-3 individuals responsible for most of the feed demand activity in the tanks. Most NT individuals stayed in the shelter during the open field test while most of BCT individuals moved out of it. Overall, NT were shyer than BCT or the OFT was not adapted to NT. Linking the results of the self-feeding experiment and OFT in BCT, we found a strong positive correlation between the triggering activity and females' shyness. Fish that spent more time inside than outside the shelter and which latency to emerge from shelter was longer, were characterized by a higher triggering activity (high-triggering fish). This study confirms the NT ability to use self-feeder devices and provides the first insight into the same ability in BCT and demonstrates links with personality traits. These results have a potential interest for the success of BCT and NT hybridization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Conditions in the field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions, and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components. Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals are observed.

Here we sought to determine how individual differences in activity and aggression, as measured in an open-field trial, were related to natal dispersal distance in a wild population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). For 14 cohorts, while individual aggression consistently had no association with dispersal distance, the association between activity and dispersal fluctuated through time, mediated by population density. The environmental-dependence of the relationship between personality and dispersal in this population is indicative of the importance of considering external conditions when predicting dispersal behaviour."

We examined the association between three proxies of the behavioural stress response and breast plumage colouration in barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) nestlings. We found that nestling behavioural responses were consistent within individuals and similar among siblings, thus suggesting that these behaviours may contribute to define individual `personalities'.

Evidence supporting a link between personality and cognition, however, is still limited and contradictory. In this study, we then conducted a laboratory experiment with zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) aimed at examining the role of cognition in shaping individual differences in contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in behavior between contexts). Specifically, we measured neophobia by quantifying the latency of the birds to eat near a novel object in two different environments across a social gradient and assessed their learning performance on two discriminant tasks and a reversal task. In agreement with our expectation, we found that less neophobic individuals were less plastic in their responses compared to more neophobic ones. Less neophobic individuals were also faster to reach the learning criterion but only in the less difficult discriminant task they performed first. On the contrary, although we found evidence for individual consistency in learning performances, differences among individuals in the number of trials needed to pass the task in both the more difficult discriminant and reversal tasks were not associated with individual differences in neophobia. Thus, our findings indicate that individual differences in contextual plasticity do not necessarily result from some individuals being more sensitive to environmental changes. Instead, we suggest that differences among individuals in their level of plasticity might result from differences in the number of suitable habitats they may occupy."

In territorial animals, fitness depends fundamentally on resource-defense behavior-their response to various threats from conspecific competitors. Such systems thus offer an ideal opportunity to investigate individual differences in behavioral plasticity. We used male superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) to test for individual differences in the intensity and plasticity of territorial defense behavior. Using captive assays, we identified behavioral types on the basis of fast versus slow exploration of a novel environment (the ``proactive-reactive{''} axis of behavior). Then we simulated territorial intrusions in the wild, using playback of experimentally manipulated songs that differed in trill length in a pair-wise design. Although previous work suggests that proactive individuals are more aggressive and less responsive than reactive individuals, we found no support for these differences in the context of territorial defense in the wild. Fast explorers (proactive) and slow explorers (reactive) responded equally aggressively to a simulated territorial intrusion overall. Furthermore, although fast explorers responded equally strongly to the two different playback stimuli, there was little evidence that slow explorers differentiated between the two stimuli, and this ``I x E{''} interaction was not statistically significant.

We found that dominants that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover, changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative tendencies.

We provided 98 juvenile crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development, throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3 weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the 2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats.

While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to reveal linkages or trade - offs. In animals, these validations have widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The animals did not learn to ``always choose the larger item{''} in the cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual differences.

Individuals also showed repeatable behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex, body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual differences in cognition difficult to interpret.

To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of consistent behavioural traits on both learning and cognition. We investigated whether certain personality traits ('exploration' and `sociability') of individuals were related to cognitive performance, learning flexibility and learning style in a social ungulate species, the goat (Capra hircus). We also investigated whether a preference for feature cues rather than impaired learning abilities can explain performance variation in a visual discrimination task. We found that personality scores were consistent across time and context. Less explorative goats performed better in a non-associative cognitive task, in which subjects had to follow the trajectory of a hidden object (i.e. testing their ability for object permanence). We also found that less sociable subjects performed better compared to more sociable goats in a visual discrimination task. Good visual learning performance was associated with a preference for feature cues, indicating personality-dependent learning strategies in goats. Our results suggest that personality traits predict the outcome in visual discrimination and non-associative cognitive tasks in goats and that impaired performance in a visual discrimination tasks does not necessarily imply impaired learning capacities, but rather can be explained by a varying preference for feature cues.

Exploration may influence learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality. Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90 degrees (vertical, the S+) and 135 degrees (the S-). After training pigeons underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the direction towards the S-. These results suggest that birds with different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned information. Further testing is needed to confirm which cue(s) (S+ or S-) control the behaviour of fast-explorers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

While recent studies support a link between cognition and personality, the directionality of this relationship still needs to be clarified. Early-life experiences can affect adult behaviour, and among these, cognitive stimulation has been suggested theoretically to influence personality. Yet, the influence of early cognitive stimulation has rarely been explored in empirical investigations of animal behaviour and personality. We investigated the effect of early cognitive stimulation on adult personality in the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To this end, we assessed adult behaviour across a number of personality assays and compared behaviour of individuals previously exposed to a series of learning tasks as chicks, with that of control individuals lacking this experience. We found that individuals exposed to early stimulation were, as adults, more vigilant and performed fewer escape attempts in personality assays. Other behaviours describing personality traits in the fowl were not affected. We conclude that our results support the hypothesis that early stimulation can affect aspects of adult behaviour and personality, suggesting a hitherto underappreciated causality link between cognition and personality. Future research should aim to confirm these findings and resolve their underlying dynamics and proximate mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Recently, it has been suggested that proactive personality types might also exhibit fast cognitive styles. The speed with which individuals sample environmental cues is one way in which correlations between personality and cognition might arise. Here, we measured a collection of behavioural traits (competitiveness, neophobia, neophilia, task-directed motivation and exploration) in common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) and measured their relationship with problem solving. We predicted that fast solving mynas would interact with (i.e. sample) the problem solving task at higher rates, but also be more competitive, less neophobic, more neophilic, and more exploratory. Mynas that were faster to solve a novel foraging problem were no more competitive around food and no more inclined to take risks. Unexpectedly, these fast-solving mynas had higher rates of interactions with the task, but also displayed lower levels of exploration. It is possible that a negative relation between problem solving and spatial exploration arose as a consequence of how inter individual variation in exploration was quantified. We discuss the need for greater consensus on how to measure exploratory behaviour before we can advance our understanding of relationships between cognition and personality more effectively.

In male Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further, vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles. Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low) and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i) decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I. cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general. Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary explanations for the reported patterns. Significance statement The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal personality, and it also affects individual behaviour."

Much recent progress has come from the use of the open-field test, which is routinely used to separate individuals into fast and slow explorers. However, there is no standard way to conduct the test and it is unclear whether the test really measures exploration. Here, we addressed these issues by combining an open-field test with a battery of independent assays intended to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the behavioural traits suggested to measure exploration in the open-field test. Our study subjects were common mynas, Acridotheres tristis, introduced to Australia. The analyses confirmed that the open-field test allows individuals to be separated according to their propensity to explore, mainly through metrics related to spatial and object examination of the novel cage. However, other metrics classically used to describe exploratory behaviour, such as the latency to enter the novel space, reflected shyness rather than exploration. The open-field test can therefore be a powerful tool to investigate personality, but only if the biological meanings of the metrics derived from the test are properly validated with independent behavioural assays.

I examined whether wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, were consistent in their responses to diverse novel objects, and tested whether experimentally assayed boldness predicted the number of times individuals were observed inspecting naturally occurring snakes at close range. Boldness was repeatable across three novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections predicted approach of this item. Age-sex class differences in boldness and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder than adult females and had higher snake inspection counts. These age-sex differences fit well with expected variation in risk-reward ratios of exploratory risk-taking behaviour considered within a life history framework for this species. The results of this study provide a crucial ecological validation of using novel object tests to assay boldness in a wild primate. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity.

While numerous theories have been proposed to explain these behavioural variations, empirical studies on this subject remain lacking. Here, we test ecological theory by studying the combined effects of physiological condition and habitat quality on the behaviour of individual mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, across the spawning season (early spawning season and 2 months after). We assessed the boldness, energy stores and reproductive effort of crabs collected across 10 oyster reefs of low and high quality using laboratory observations and subsequent dissections. Crab boldness was significantly dependent on the interaction between habitat quality and season. While crab behaviour remained relatively constant on healthy reefs, crabs on degraded reefs exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in boldness during the late spawning season, approximating the boldness of crabs on healthy reefs. This behavioural change corresponds to a seasonal shift in crab energy store content and is likely to represent a switch in the primary driving force of crab behaviour. During the early season, crab boldness was positively correlated with short-term stores, whereas later in the season, crab boldness was negatively correlated with long-term stores. Our results suggest that behaviour is driven by predation pressure and refuge availability during the early spawning season, but afterwards depends on replenishing energy stores used for reproduction. These findings support ecological theory and also provide new insight into the stability of behavioural drivers.

Key in this regard is the, often untested, assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for significant between-individual correlations between the investigated traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have important implications for the social organization within complex social environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant processes.

Consistent interindividual differences in behavioural profiles are generally regarded as a hallmark for animal `personality' in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their proximate causes are poorly understood. While the social experiences of winning and losing are known to lead to heightened and depressed aggressiveness, respectively, and that different fighting experiences can lead to changes in other behaviours, the extent to which interindividual variation in aggression and correlated behaviours are determined alone by fighting experience, environmental factors or inherited predisposition is unclear. In this study, we video tracked individual, virgin adult male crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to quantify their general motility, exploratory behaviour and attraction to conspecific males after 48 h of social isolation, and compared this with their performances 24 h later, immediately after a fighting tournament that yielded cohorts of aggressive winners and submissive losers. Although all known behavioural effects of previous social experience in crickets last only a few hours at most, we found significant behavioural differences between the 48 h isolated future winners and losers, i.e. before the fight tournament. However, the experiences of winning and losing led to more pronounced and some additional changes in behaviour. We discuss whether these different behavioural profiles associated with the chances of winning and losing ('personalities') could arise from factors other than fighting experience, or possibly from dominance and subjugation experiences gathered under crowded culture conditions before social isolation with cumulative effects that may persist longer than those presently known.

In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles. Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic female resistance."

We created experimental communities of web-building spiders, each with an identical species composition. Communities contained one individual of each of five different species. Prior to establishing these communities in the field, we examined three behavioural traits for each individual spider. These behavioural measures allowed us to estimate community-wide behavioural diversity, as inferred by the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by the entire community. Communities that occupied a larger region of behavioural-trait space (i.e. where spiders differed more from each other behaviourally) gained more mass and were less likely to disband. Thus, there is a community-wide benefit to multidimensional behavioural diversity in this system that might translate to other multispecies assemblages."

It comprises the termination of suckling and is characterized by several changes in the behaviour of both mother and offspring. Furthermore, numerous studies in rodents have shown that the time point of weaning shapes the behavioural profile of the young. Most of these studies, however, have focused on `early weaning', while relatively little work has been done to study `late weaning' effects. The aim of the present study was therefore to explore behavioural effects of `late weaning', and furthermore to gain insights into modulating effects of weaning age on the consistency of behavioural expressions over time. In total, 25 male and 20 female C57BL/6J mice, weaned after three (W3) or four (W4) weeks of age, were subjected to a series of behavioural paradigms widely used to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploratory locomotion, and nest building performance. Behavioural testing took place with the mice reaching an age of 20 weeks and was repeated eight weeks later to investigate the stability of behavioural expressions over time. At the group level, W4 mice behaved less anxious and more explorative than W3 animals in the Open Field and Novel Cage, while anxiety-like behaviour on the Elevated Plus Maze was modulated by a weaning-age-by-sex interaction. Furthermore, weaning age shaped the degree of behavioural stability over time in a sex-specific way. While W3 females and W4 males displayed a remarkable degree of behavioural stability over time, no such patterns were observed in W3 males and W4 females. Adding to the existing literature, we could thus confirm that effects of weaning age do indeed exist when prolonging this phase, and were furthermore able to provide first evidence for the impact of weaning age and sex on the consistency of behavioural expressions over time."

Personality traits, consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies so far have investigated the link between personality traits and dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups, dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance hierarchies found in nature.

Populations of Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits. Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex, while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that fish caught from environments without predators and with probable intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes, relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of studying temperament within a community ecology context.

These differences are often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for the development of personality in animals. Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is, individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this study, we observed that personality differences were not present at juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that the decline in behavioral plasticity with age may represent a relevant mechanism for behavioral differentiation in animals, in agreement with evidences from the human literature on age-related loss in behavioral plasticity."

Finally, differences in brood rescue efficiency correlated positively with colony growth, queen and worker production, and larvae survival. These results show that colony-level personality may be linked with differences in colony life-history strategy, which may promote the emergence and maintenance of personality traits in group-living species. Significance statement When groups of individuals show variation in a series of behaviours that are related to exploratory activity and parental care, is it related to differences in groups' productivity? This is a key question to understand the process underlying the evolution and maintenance of consistent behavioural differences in a population. Here, we investigated whether exploratory, boldness, and brood rescue behaviours expressed at the colony-level are associated with group productivity that is, colony growth, queen and worker production, and larvae survival in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster senilis. Overall, this experiment reveals that behaviours in group-living species are linked with group productivity."

In fact, no study of nonhuman primates has consistently mapped personality development from birth to adulthood. Our study aimed at closing this gap by examining the development of personality among free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, using longitudinal behavioural data of 24 subjects (3758 h) collected from birth to 7 years of age on the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico, U.S.A. In our analyses we combined different frameworks of animal personality research to discuss behavioural differences in terms of latent personality models, behavioural syndromes and behavioural characters. The results showed that a core model of rhesus macaque personality, comprising three latent factors (Fearfulness, Aggression, Sociability), can already be established over the course of the first 7 years of life. However, only Fearfulness emerged consistently throughout development. While the factor of Sociability diffused during maturation, Aggression stabilized towards adulthood after having inconsistent loadings during infancy. When assessing correlations among behaviours separately on the within- and between-individual level, again only Fearfulness showed significant results averaged over the entire study period and can therefore be classified as behavioural syndrome or behavioural character. We discuss differences in correlations, interactions between sex and age and the effect of maternal rank as potential source of differences in stability of latent traits. Furthermore, we assessed plasticity of behaviour with regard to first maternity in females and natal dispersal of males. While the latter was accompanied by an increase of fearful behaviour and decrease of physical aggression, first maternity was marked by a mixed pattern of changes. Overall, our results suggest that rhesus macaques are not born into their personality, but grow into it. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \% more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral strategy."

In particular, fitness trade-offs associated with abiotic factors remain underrepresented in the animal personality literature. Here, we examine the interacting effects of personality and temperature on survival and reproduction-both at the individual and colony level-using the socially polymorphic spider Anelosimus studiosus as a model system. Overall, temperature had a profound effect on survival and reproduction, but the effect differed according to both individual personality and the personality composition of colonies. Temperature was positively correlated with mortality rates but negatively correlated with reproductive rates in aggressive individuals, whereas the opposite was true in docile individuals. Colonies composed of either all aggressive or all docile individuals suffered reduced reproductive rates in high and low temperatures, respectively. In contrast, colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile individuals performed equally well at both high and low temperatures, suggesting that some aspect of colony living helps buffer individuals with ill-suited personalities from environmental conditions that would otherwise lead to their demise. Our study demonstrates the need to consider both abiotic and biotic (i.e., social) context when assessing the impact of personality on fitness."

We investigated how individual variation in swimming activity of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) changes in response to natural fluctuations of water temperature as a proxy for an ecological gradient for ectothermic animals. Using an automated acoustic telemetry system, we tracked individual positions of adult perch in a whole natural lake for about 1 year and compared several model frameworks for the individual responses to water temperature. The best-fit model revealed that rising water temperature led to an increase in both between-and within-individual variation in activity, thereby stabilizing behavioral repeatability across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent individual differences in behavior could be partially explained by factors such as slowly changing states in the wild. By using ecologically relevant data, our results revealed complex patterns of behavioral variation in response to an environmental change represented by water temperature."

Constructions also modulate the expression of individual behavior, ultimately affecting the presence and importance of animal personality within populations. The exact impact of constructions on personality is seldom investigated. We quantified experimentally the impact of web characteristics on individual foraging behavior in the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus). We assayed aggressiveness toward a prey cue, and boldness while individuals resided on their own web versus after being translocated onto webs built by conspecifics. We quantified the importance of individual differences in aggressiveness and boldness while accounting for differences in web characteristics. We tested for relationships between web building, aggressiveness, and boldness. Web characteristics affected spider aggressiveness and interacted with individual web-building behavior to explain up to a fifth of the variation in foraging aggression, but did not affect spider boldness. Even after accounting for web characteristics, individuals still exhibited important differences in aggressiveness. We detected no relationship between an individual's aggressiveness behavioral type and the characteristics of the web it built. Surprisingly, web characteristics impacted aggressiveness differently from one individual to the next. Hence the effect of web characteristics on foraging behavior might depend on condition or past experience. Webs contributed mostly to the variation in aggressiveness within-individuals. Variation in web building behavior might affect the amount of consistent differences in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior among individuals and needs to be accounted for when quantifying individual variation in behavior in spiders."

One theory suggests that personality could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for development after a change in social status. In the facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers, suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However, novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism for generating individual differences in behavior."

When these behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted within the ``coping style{''} framework. As studying inter-individual variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second, explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was considerable covariation among the stress response parameters, describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level. Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food acquisition tactics and demographic performance.

Environmental variation can lead to divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish, Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours, the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world could serve as a valuable conservation tool.

However, the reasons for such variation remains to be fully explained. Aggressiveness, in terms of a personality trait, offers a potentially important source of variation that has typically been overlooked. Therefore, we studied how aggressiveness as a personality trait influenced escalation between contestants matched for resource-holding potential (RHP), using detailed observations of the contest behaviour, contest dynamics and escalation levels. We predicted that winner and loser behaviour would differ depending on personality. This was tested by examining 52 dyadic contests between pigs, Sus scrofa. Aggressiveness was assayed in resident-intruder tests prior to the contest. Contests were then staged between pigs matched for RHP in terms of body weight but differing in their aggressiveness. In 27\% of the contests a winner emerged without escalated physical fighting, demonstrating that a fight is not a prerequisite between RHP-matched contestants. However, the duration of contests with or without fighting was the same. In contests without a fight, opponents spent more time on mutual investigation and noncontact displays such as parallel walking, which suggests that ritualized display may facilitate assessment and decision making. Winners low in aggressiveness invested more time in opponent investigation and display and showed substantially less aggression towards the loser after its retreat compared to aggressive winners. Aggressiveness influenced contest dynamics but did not predict the level of escalation. Prominent behavioural differences were found for the interaction between personality and outcome and we therefore recommend including this interaction in models where personality is considered. Analyses based on contest duration only would miss many of the subtleties shown here and we therefore encourage more detailed analyses of animal contests, irrespective of the level of contest escalation.

The pace-of-life syndrome concept posits that behavioural, physiological and life-history traits coevolve in response to correlated selection pressures, and therefore predicts a positive correlation between boldness (i.e. exploration and risk taking) and metabolic capacity for locomotor performance in individuals. We tested for a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity for locomotor activity in juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Individual fish were screened and classified as bold or shy using an established refuge emergence test. Subsequently, the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms of bold and shy individuals were quantified using respirometry and by measuring the metabolic by-products of white muscle anaerobic glycolysis following exhaustive exercise, respectively. Bold fish demonstrated 25\% greater metabolic scope for activity (i.e. aerobic capacity) than shy fish, which was attributable to a 15\% greater maximum metabolic rate. However, there was no significant difference in resting metabolic rate or anaerobic energy expenditure (i.e. anaerobic capacity) between bold and shy fish. These results partially support a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and aerobic metabolism in juvenile bluegill sunfish, but did not reveal a link between boldness and anaerobic metabolism. Our findings suggest that aerobic and anaerobic capacities may be subject to different selection pressures, and that physiological processes governing maximum anaerobic performance in fishes are independent from behavioural and physiological traits related to boldness.

An individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum has many implications. Bold individuals may outperform shyer conspecifics during foraging as they cover more ground, accumulate information more rapidly and make more frequent food discoveries. Individual variation in boldness may also affect behavioural plasticity across environmental contexts, as the time to process new information, the ability to locate and memorise resources and the time and ability to apply prior information in a novel context all differ between individuals. The primary aim of the current study was to examine plasticity in, and covariation between, boldness, foraging speed and foraging accuracy across social foraging contexts. We showed that the stickleback that were shyest when foraging alone became relatively boldest when foraging in a social context and also delayed their entry to a known food patch the most in the presence of conspecifics. These results support the assertion that shyer foragers are more reactive to social cues and add to current knowledge of how an individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum may correlate to foraging task performance and behavioural plasticity. We conclude that the correlation between boldness and behavioural plasticity may have broad relevance as the ability to adjust or retain behaviours in changing social environments could often have consequences for fitness. Animal personality may affect how much individuals change their behaviour to suit different environments. We studied the link between threespine stickleback personality (boldness or shyness), foraging performance and change in foraging performance when either alone or in the presence of other stickleback. We found that shyer threespine stickleback were more reactive to the presence of other fish when foraging. When observed or joined by other fish, shy stickleback started exploring earlier, but entered a known food patch later, than when alone. Bolder stickleback changed their foraging behaviour much less in the presence of other fish. Our results suggest that how bold or shy individuals are may have important consequences on how well they adjust their foraging behaviour to environmental change."

In many animals, male and female behaviour often diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring the very strong possibility that key components of personality, behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that explains the delicate skink's successful invasion history via accidental introductions. We found that females were more social than males and showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were consistently more active explored environments faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade. Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual's personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome. Our results suggest limited behavioural variation between the sexes and that both sexes may have an equal invasion potential."

Furthermore, elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves, and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this, we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e., variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences. Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that individuals face throughout their lives. Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel environment).

For social organisms, the social context in which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone, (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual personality traits. These results provide a first glimpse into the relative roles of individual personality and social context in mediating gene flow among populations from divergent environments.

We examined if personality-related variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in feeder choice in response to changes in food availability, nor personality-related differences in flexibility in behavioral responses."

In particular, the relationship between individual differences in architectural constructions and behavior (i.e., animal personalities) is largely unexplored. Individual black widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, build a 3D cobweb made up of distinctive components serving to support foraging (gumfooted lines) or antipredator protection (structural lines). To explore the relationship between individual differences in behavior and architectural constructions, we quantified 1) the level of consistent individual variation in several elements of web structure and 2) the level of consistent individual variation in foraging behavior and its relationship with web structure. We controlled for condition-dependent or environmental effects by satiating all spiders prior to assays and maintaining them in standardized conditions. Spiders exhibited consistent differences in the number of gumfooted lines they built for capturing preys and overall web weight, but not in the number of structural lines. Individuals also varied consistently in their tendency to attack a prey cue, despite all spiders being satiated. Finally, spiders producing more gumfooted lines exhibited a higher tendency to attack the prey cue. Our results suggest that the architectural constructions may impact the expression of individual behavioral differences (or animal personalities) and suggest that individual behavior and extended phenotype may be part of alternative foraging strategies in L. hesperus."

However, it is not known whether host manipulation affects the consistency of host personality traits or correlations between these traits. Here, using fish hosts and their eye-lens infecting parasite, we show that manipulative effects of parasites on host personalities are weak.Among the ecological factors acting on the evolution and expression of animal personalities and behavioral syndromes, parasitism has received comparatively little attention. However, infection and host behavior are often strongly intertwined, because host behavior can predict the risk of infection and can also be changed by an infection. We conducted a controlled experimental infection study to explore the effects of infection on host boldness, exploration and activity using rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and its trematode parasite Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, which infects a central sensory organ of the fish, the eye lens. Contrary to our expectation, infection did not change the within-individual consistency of the personality traits or the relationships between the traits, but infected individuals were less bold than uninfected control individuals. We also found no relationship between personality in uninfected fish and resistance against parasite infection, suggesting that behaviors which increase parasite encounter do not select for improved resistance. Thus, we found only weak support for parasite-mediated effects on animal personalities."

The group is, however, also generally described as neophobic, a trait that increases the difficulty of undertaking such research. In Australia, Torresian crows (Corvus orru) have, like corvid species worldwide, thrived in urban environments, sharing this habitat with a number of other corvoid (Superfamily: CORVOIDEA) species. While each of these species has successfully colonised urban areas, the extent to which neophobia is present is not known. This study empirically tested the extent to which neophobia is exhibited in wild urban Torresian crows by measuring the delaying effect of a novel object to obtaining food and any changes in neophobic behaviours displayed. This was then compared with the other urban corvoid species that inhabit similar niches. This study confirmed that Torresian crows are significantly wary of a novel objects, displaying more neophobic behaviours and taking longer to attain the food. Crow behaviour provided evidence in support of both the dangerous niche hypothesis and the two-factor model of neophobia and neophilia. Crows also displayed these behaviours to a significantly greater extent than the three other corvoids studied. However, the individual variation in crow behaviours when exposed to a novel object was extensive. This variation may be attributed to differing behavioural types between individuals, or different experiences with novel objects or humans in the bird's past."

Wild yearling brown trout (N=103) were caught, individually tagged for identification and scored for open-field activity during standardized laboratory tests in June. Fifty gravid freshwater pearl mussels were relocated to the stream, where after the trout were released back into the stream. The fish were recaptured in October (N=35), checked for glochidia encystment (infested individuals: n=6) and re-scored for open-field activity traits. Swimming velocity during the test was higher in fish infected with glochidia, suggesting that high activity could increase their exposure to glochidia. Potentially, as metabolism rate and ventilation rate typically increase with activity, elevated activity may lead to an increased likelihood of glochidia passing over the gills. This novel finding suggests that glochidia infestation is non-random and that the behaviour of the host fish can influence the likelihood of glochidia infestation."

In this study, we investigate animal personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional factors, which are linked to biological internal factors that are stable and perhaps heritable. Although not directly measurable, these underlying dispositional factors predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the consistency across time of the inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards two different novelty tests: a novel object test representing non-social contexts and a mirror test representing social contexts. Our study animals were 60 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised in identical housing conditions. We recorded the approach behaviour of the mink towards novelty at two different times: the first time during non-breeding season in December 2013 and the second time during pre-breeding season in February 2014. Behavioural variables were analysed using principal component analyses and our results show consistency in inter individual variation in shyness measures across seasons. This consistency differed across non-social and social contexts forming two different shyness-boldness dimensions as were also found across context in a previous study. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum across time and season in the American mink from non-breeding season in December to pre-breeding season in February. Our study confirms the existence of personality in farmed American mink, but interestingly, we saw a shift in the positioning of most individuals from shy to more bold on the shyness continuum when comparing the December measures to the February measures. This shift was further supported by the results of a simple stick test, which indicated a change towards a higher responsiveness towards humans in the pre-breeding season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using path analysis, we found that human disturbance and choice of nest site with respect to nest density may both mediate the link between personality and reproductive success. Bolder females may choose nest sites with lower nest density, and the low nest density in turn may be responsible for a positive effect on nestling number, and have a negative effect on nestling mass. Bolder females may also prefer nest sites further from human settlements, resulting in a negative effect on nestling mass.

Such measurements have been then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context. Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts. Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same individuals show under natural conditions. Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects the variation that the same individuals would show if the same measurements were taken directly in their natural habitat. Here, we used wild African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. Using similar protocols, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context and then compared measurements across the two different contexts.

Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity, exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects. Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology and evolution of behavior."

This constrains the independent evolution of traits and can lead to unpredicted ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Animals might frequently exhibit genetic associations among behavioural and morphological-physiological traits, because the physiological mechanisms behind animal personality can have broad multitrait effects and because many selective agents influence the evolution of multiple types of traits. However, we currently know little about genetic correlations between animal personalities and nonbehavioural traits. We tested for associations between personality, morphology and locomotor performance by comparing zebrafish (Danio rerio) collected from the wild and then selectively bred for either a proactive or reactive stress coping style ('bold' or `shy' phenotypes). Based on adaptive hypotheses of correlational selection in the wild, we predicted that artificial selection for boldness would produce correlated evolutionary responses of larger caudal regions and higher fast-start escape performance (and the opposite for shyness). After four to seven generations, morphology and locomotor performance differed between personality lines: bold zebrafish exhibited a larger caudal region and higher fast-start performance than fish in the shy line, matching predictions. Individual-level phenotypic correlations suggested that pleiotropy or physical gene linkage likely explained the correlated response of locomotor performance, while the correlated response of body shape may have reflected linkage disequilibrium, which is breaking down each generation in the laboratory. Our results indicate that evolution of personality can result in concomitant changes in morphology and whole-organism performance, and vice versa.

This variability comes from consistent differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{'' ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability) impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis, one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days. Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/- 34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness. In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of environmental conditions and life history on behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The study of personality differences across individuals within the same behavioral caste may contribute to an understanding of how social insects divide labor within the nest. Here, we define and investigate three dimensions of personality within the worker caste of a model social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, as follows: (1) consistent individual behavioral differences over time, (2) consistent individual behavioral differences across contexts, and (3) the presence of correlated suites of behaviors. To test whether honey bee workers exhibit dimensions 1 and 2, we repeatedly assessed responses of groups of same-age bees in cages to stimuli that are relevant to bee life history. To test for dimension 3, we examined behavior within a colony context by using observation hives to record the behaviors of individual bees across their lifetimes. Our results provide some evidence for all three dimensions of personality in honey bee workers. In particular, our data suggest some individuals may be more likely to be highly interactive with other workers (e.g., engaging in food sharing), while other individuals are consistently less interactive. These findings expand upon and contribute to previous models for the organization of worker division of labor in honey bees, suggesting that consistent behavioral differences (personalities) of workers within a behavioral caste have the potential to contribute to subcaste division of labor. Significance statement Behavioral ecologists have become increasingly interested in animal personalities, individual behavioral differences that are consistent over time and in different contexts, with recent focus on understanding the occurrence of personalities across taxa and their adaptive value. The existence and function of personality differences among individuals in complex societies, such as eusocial insects, remain understudied. Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of whether workers of the highly eusocial honey bee show hallmarks of personality. Although these workers demonstrate well-documented behavioral changes as they age, we uncovered some aspects of their behavior, in particular, their tendency to physically interact with other bees, remain somewhat consistent even as they age and change roles within the colony. We suggest that individual-level personality differences have the potential to contribute to colony division of labor by creating variation in individual tendencies to perform different tasks."

Given their unique life history traits (e.g. slow growth rate, slow reproduction rate, long life span) and their pivotal role in ecosystem processes, this is an important gap in our current knowledge. Here we investigated consistency and plasticity in movement behaviour of wild juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, by repeatedly subjecting sharks to open field tests. First, we investigated the presence of interindividual differences in movement behaviour in a novel open field. Second, we investigated the effect of trial repetition on movement behaviour to understand whether movement in a novel open field reflects a reaction to novelty, or general activity. Third, we estimated individual differences in habituation/sensitization rates over trial repetition and studied how the habituation rate was predicted by the initial movement rate. We found consistent individual differences in movement behaviour during the open field tests. Sharks showed habituation in movement behaviour (i.e. decrease) over repeated trials indicating that the movement behaviour during the first trials is a reaction to novelty, and not general activity. Individuals, however, differed in their rate of habituation (i.e. plasticity) and this rate was negatively related to an individual's movement behaviour in the first open field trial. In addition to showing individual differences in consistency and plasticity in juvenile lemon sharks, our study emphasizes the importance of examining the validity of personality tests when adapting them to new species.

Studying the relationship between behavior and other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) framework, which explains the integration of different traits using the concept of a fast-slow life-history continuum, may thus be a useful approach to understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personality. According to the POLS hypothesis, for example, fast individuals should be behaviorally more active, bolder or less sociable, and potentially invest more in reproduction than slow individuals. Here, we examined whether the sociability of juvenile sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is linked with their key reproductive traits, carotenoid-based nuptial coloration of males and egg production of females. We also tested whether experimental manipulation of environmental conditions (control vs. warm winter) can change pace-of-life and the link between behavioral and reproductive traits. Male sticklebacks prone to shoaling expressed lower peak red coloration at the reproductive stage, during which they were solitary and territorial. In females, fecundity was not correlated with early social behavior. Experimental sticklebacks reared in warm winter conditions decreased their investment in reproduction, but the negative relationship between sociability and sexual signal of males was maintained. Our results suggest that the POLS could partly explain the maintenance of personality under predation pressure or severe mating competition. In natural environments, any benefit to sociable male sticklebacks may be counterbalanced by the cost of growing less attractive. Why do animals vary in personality, and how is such variation maintained within a population? An interesting approach for understanding this is studying how personality traits are correlated with other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life framework. For the first time, our results show the link between sociability at the juvenile stage and the expression of sexual ornament during reproduction in male three-spined sticklebacks. Sociable juveniles may benefit from reduced predation risk, but they grow less attractive and this may reduce their mating success during reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between survival and reproduction may contribute to the maintenance of among-individual variation in behavior."

Bolder, larger and more colourful males are expected to preferentially court females, while shy, small and drab-coloured individuals are predicted to sneak copulations. We used males of Endler's guppy, Poecilia wingei, to test this association over a long temporal period (hence including ontogenetic changes) and under two social environments (male-biased and female-biased). We found that personality traits (exploration, boldness, activity) of P.wingei males were highly repeatable across long time spans, but they were not correlated (formed no behavioural syndrome). Male age and social environment had no effect on any personality trait, despite their effects on alternative mating behaviour. Young males with higher activity levels were more likely to attempt sneaking. In older fish, there was an association between orange coloration, courtship and boldness, but this was not observed in young males. Our results suggest that alternative mating behaviour is more flexible than personality traits and is independent of them.

Prey populations are comprised of individuals that differ in perception of and willingness to take risk; therefore, studying how different types of individuals respond to predation risk is necessary to fully understand prey dynamics. Playbacks were used to experimentally manipulate perceived predation risk in nest-box populations of wild great tits (Parus major) to examine the nonconsumptive effects of avian predators on prey behavior and morphology, and to explore individual differences in prey response. Individuals responded to our treatment, and responses differed depending on both treatment and pre-manipulation behavioral type. Birds in areas exposed to predator playback tended to decrease in body mass more than birds exposed to nonthreatening (control) playback. Differences between treatment groups were mainly driven by initially fast exploring birds: In the control treatment, fast explorers increased in mass, whereas the initially fast exploring birds in the predation treatment decreased in mass. Furthermore, birds exposed to predator playback decreased exploratory tendency compared with controls. These findings demonstrate that predation risk alters great tit behavior (exploration) and morphology (body mass) and that plasticity in response to risk relates to an individual's willingness to take risks. Our findings suggest that individuals differ in susceptibility to predation risk, causing adaptive individual differences in responsiveness to changes in predation risk. Acknowledging individuality in responses to perceived predation risk has important consequences for understanding prey dynamics."

A key model system to study this variation in signal expression is birdsong. Yet, despite good ecological understanding of why song varies across time of day and season, much of the individual variation remains unexplained. Although some of the interindividual variation in singing depends on the quality or motivation of an individual, it can also vary with other characteristics. Because singing has been shown to vary with personality traits in specific contexts, personality is thus an important candidate to explain part of the variation in seasonal and daily singing. Using a personality-typed field population of great tits (Parus major), we here show that singing activity peaked at dawn during the fertile period of the females and that the association between male personality and singing activity depended on the reproductive stage of his mate; faster explorers significantly increased in singing activity during main periods of fertility and maternal investment (egg laying and incubation). Moreover, males with higher singing activity tended to raise more fledglings. Increased singing by faster explorers during key periods of female reproductive investment suggests that faster explorers are more responsive to changes in female reproductive stage, contrasting the general view that faster explorers are less responsive to environmental and social changes. Most importantly, these findings highlight that multiple factors including personality need to be integrated when assessing causes of variation of highly variable sexually selected signal traits."

In particular, we observed that average activity increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones.

In the present study, we investigated how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how their responses change with experience with important predators, Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus, colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to determine which individual traits were associated with task participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level, with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making. Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

However, studies examining whether these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare. Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014 we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of personality on reproductive success differed between changing environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments.

Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of male personality. Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating preferences. Instead, females agreed remarkably well in their mating decisions and consistently favored large males with elaborate nests. Our results show that male personality is important for nest allocation, which is crucial in environments where nesting sites are rare."

Since most personality traits are heritable and linked with fitness, ontogenetic changes can have evolutionary implications. In this paper, we explore age-related changes in two behavioral responses to handling, both of which are heritable and associated with fitness, in wild blue tits. We find that one of these responses (handling aggression), which is positively correlated with fitness, declines with age. We show that this age-related decline is not due to selective disappearance, but occurs also within individuals, which confirms that this personality trait undergoes a senescent decline in the wild. We further find that individuals differ significantly in their rate of ageing but found no statistical support for the presence of genotype-age interactions on personality. Future research on personality would benefit from a more explicit lifetime perspective. Our study constitutes the first demonstration of a senescent decline in a personality trait and underlines the need for future research on personality to adopt a more explicit lifetime perspective. In addition, we provide an example of how to investigate age-related plasticity in behavior while dealing with typical issues arising from the use of longitudinal data, which will be of interest for behavioral ecologists. Finally, our approach is likely to stimulate research given its relevance for both our proximate and ultimate understanding of animal personality in nature."

We examined here the behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge). We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies. We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage, and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important, because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on differences between males and females, probably indicating on differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging. Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior."

Previous studies in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) suggested that individual differences in behaviour reflect distinct coping styles or personality, contrasting consistent traits associations. One of the traits that have been shown to be consistent over time and across context is the escape response under a restraining test. Using this trait as a proxy of personality in seabream the influence of social context in the consistency of escape behaviour was investigated. Individually tagged juvenile seabream (n = 360; 70.18 +/- 11.44 g; mean +/- SD) were subjected to a restraining test that consisted of keeping each fish in an emerged net for one minute. Behaviours measured in the net (latency to escape; number of escape attempts and total time spent on escaping) were collapsed into first principal component scores using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Using the PCA scores the individuals were distributed into homogeneous groups (n = 30 each group) of proactive, reactive and intermediate. Control groups consisted of mixed groups with 1/3 of each coping style. After one month the same individuals were exposed to the same test (restraining test) to assess consistency of behavioural responses. Results indicate that homogenous groups of proactive (p = 0.086) and reactive (p = 0.159) individuals did not exhibit consistent behavioural responses as opposed to the intermediate (p = 0.028) and control groups (p < 0.001). This study thus confirms that the social context in which fish are kept significantly influence personality traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here, we explored whether activity and risk-taking varied consistently between individuals and correlated to various potentially fitness linked - male traits in Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni). Lizards showed significant consistency within both behaviours, implying the presence of activity and risk-taking personalities. However, there were no correlation between activity and risk-taking, neither on the between-nor on the within-individual levels, implying the absence of a behavioural syndrome. We found a strong link between the intensity of blood parasite (Haemogregarinidae) infection and risk-taking: lizards with higher infection intensity took more risk. While we cannot distinguish cause from causative in the parasite intensity - risk-taking correlation our results are in line with the asset protection hypothesis predicting that individuals with lower future reproductive value should focus on the current reproductive event and take higher risk."

For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained."

In particular, it has been suggested that in play animals learn to cope physically and emotionally with unexpected events. Given that the propensity to play varies greatly between conspecific individuals, such interindividual variability in playfulness may be associated with differences in the animals' future behaviour, a prediction that has rarely been tested. To investigate whether different levels of playfulness in juvenility indeed coincide with behavioural differences in later life, 30 female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the following series of behavioural observations and tests: (1) quantification of juvenile play behaviour; (2) behavioural testing in paradigms that assess anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion in an unfamiliar environment; and (3) observation of spontaneous behaviour in the familiar home cage environment. Surprisingly, a high level of juvenile playfulness was predictive of high levels of state anxiety and low levels of exploratory locomotion in later life. While this relationship existed already in adolescence, it became even more prominent in adulthood. By contrast, no substantial differences between playful and less playful mice were found with respect to home cage behaviour. While these findings may reflect better coping abilities in novel and dangerous environments in those mice that played the most during juvenility, they may also argue for the existence of different types of mice. Thus, despite genetic homogeneity and identical housing environments, preferences for either local or global use of space were observed that indicate the emergence of individuality. Concerning animal welfare, our findings suggest that play may constitute a plausible welfare indicator at the population level, but is probably less meaningful for the individual.

Because these positions are a potential consequence of consistent individual behavioral differences, or personality, a better understanding of potential mechanisms concerning personality is central to predicting an individuals' location. To determine the effects of individual personality on the dynamic spatial positioning of Uca pugilator while herding, field data collection and agent-based modeling were employed. Individuals were assayed to establish their personalities and returned to the field for observation as a means of identifying location preference within selfish herds. There was a significant difference between the extreme personalities and the proportion of time spent on the edge of the herd. The active individuals were at the periphery similar to 50 \% more of the time than less active individuals. An individual-based model qualitatively replicated these field results by applying the mechanism of activity level as an indicator of individual personality. This suggests that differences in personality-dependent movement are sufficient to explain the spatial positioning of individuals within selfish herds. This study enhances our understanding of the possible mechanisms that govern group movement, and has implications for modeling population dynamics that can be influenced by individual personality. Animal personality influences the level of exploratory activity of individual animals, with some individuals being consistently more active and others consistently less active, and may therefore be used to mechanistically predict the location of individual animals within groups or herds. Here, we investigate the relationship between individual personality and location on the edge vs. in the center of foraging herds of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator. We combine observational testing of activity level in lab, observations of spatial positioning within herds in the field, and agent-based computer simulation modeling to demonstrate that differences in exploratory movement can sufficiently explain the spatial positioning of individuals within herds. Thus, the spatial positioning of individual animals within herds can be explained without relying on choices by individual animals."

Recently, however, a number of studies demonstrated that intraspecific variation can have profound consequences for species interactions and thereby alter community dynamics in solitary organisms. Here, we study how intraspecific variation in collective behaviors (also called ``collective personalities{'' affects the outcome of resource contests between 2 co-occurring species of ants, Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. Our results revealed that intraspecific variation in colonies' exploration behavior and aggressiveness predicts the outcome of interspecific contests for food and nest sites. How exploratory behavior affected the outcome of the foraging and nest site contests depended on the species: exploratory behavior seemed to enhance performance in foraging contests in T. curvispinosus but diminish it in T. longispinosus. More interestingly, whether a species was successful in nest site contests depended not only on its collective personality but also on the personality of its opponent colony. Temnothorax longispinosus experienced greater success if its opponent colony had similar exploratory tendencies to its own. In contrast, T. curvispinosus performed best when its opponent colony exhibited a contrasting exploratory tendency to its own. Our data demonstrate that intraspecific variation in colony behavior can have consequences for contest outcomes and ensure that no one species or behavioral strategy consistently experiences superior success. This, in turn, might help to maintain variation in collective behavior in multiple interacting populations and prevent competitive exclusion of one of the species."

The ``killer shrimp{''} Dikerogammarus villosus is a highly predatory amphipod that has spread readily across Central Europe and recently the UK and its arrival has been associated with the significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its behavioral ecology are sparse, even though its behavior may contribute to its invasion success. For the first time, we investigated antipredator ``fleeing{''} behavior in D. villosus and how this changed with water temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis. First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but consistent among-individual differences in behavior. These are driven by a combination of mean level among-individual differences and within-individual relative consistency in behavior, and provide the key marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were not influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus, indicating a capacity for individual learning. We suggest that the antipredator behavior of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and that consistent among-individual differences in behavior may promote biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous, particularly in an era of global climate change, where average temperatures could be elevated and less predictable."

The relationship between behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences is not clearly understood but may help predict personality variation in animals. High variation in mean behaviour and low variation in individual plastic responses will tend to maintain the rank order of individuals across situations and so permit consistent individual differences. Conversely, low variation in mean behaviour and high variation in plastic responses, by changing the rank orders of individuals, will erode consistent individual differences. Thus, selection that reduces variation in individual plastic responses should increase the opportunity for consistent individual differences in a population. We tested for relationships between heterogeneous predation regimes, the mean and variance of behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences among three species groups of larval damselflies. Larvae of Enallagma signatum probably face consistent predation from fish over successive generations, whereas Enallagma ebrium/hageni and Enallagma annexum/boreale face a changing predation regime over generations either from fish or larval dragonflies. The behavioural reaction norms of larvae in repeated exposure trials to cues from a predatory fish, dragonfly larvae or no predator differed between species groups. Enallagma ebrium/hageni expressed the most consistent plastic response to predator cues, less variability in plasticity and greater consistent individual differences across cues compared to more variable plastic responses and low consistent individual differences in E. signatum. Selection on behavioural plasticity may enhance consistent individual differences in E. ebrium/hageni whereas relaxing selection on plasticity may reduce consistent individual differences in E. signatum. More generally, selection on plastic behaviour may enhance behavioural types while selection on mean behaviour may reduce behavioural types in animal populations.

However, little attention has been paid to possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial. These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role of social carryover effects.

Becoming a parent is a major life history event, when individuals undergo dramatic behavioural and physiological changes. Here we employ a longitudinal experiment to ask whether personality changes in response to the experience of parenting in male threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Life history theory predicts that males should be less risk averse after successfully parenting, and the neuroendocrinology of parenting suggests that parenting could reorganize the hormonal landscape and behaviour of fathers. We randomly assigned males to either an experimental group (reproduced and parented) or a control group (did not reproduce and parent), and repeatedly measured a personality trait ('boldness') and 11-ketotestosterone levels (11-kT, the major androgen in fishes) in individual males. In the control group, males became bolder over time. However, in the experimental group, boldness did not change. Furthermore, 11-kT changed dramatically in the experimental group, and changes in 11-kT in parents were associated with boldness after parenting ceased.

When information quality is important for group success, such keystone individuals have the potential to diminish group performance if they possess inaccurate information. Here, we test whether information quality (accurate or inaccurate) influences collective outcomes when keystone individuals are the first to acquire it. We trained keystone or generic individuals to attack or avoid novel stimuli and implanted these trained individuals within groups of naive colony-mates. We subsequently tracked how quickly groups learned about their environment in situations that matched (accurate information) or mismatched (inaccurate information) the training of the trained individual. We found that colonies with just one accurately informed individual were quicker to learn to attack a novel prey stimulus than colonies with no informed individuals. However, this effect was no more pronounced when the informed individual was a keystone individual. In contrast, keystones with inaccurate information had larger effects than generic individuals with identical information: groups containing keystones with inaccurate information took longer to learn to attack/avoidprey/predator stimuli and gained less weight than groups harbouring generic individuals with identical information. Our results convey that misinformed keystone individuals can become points of vulnerability for their societies."

Cognitive processing of negative stimuli correlates with stress response patterns. Still, the relative contribution of cognitive appraisal or physiological demands to the behavioural output needs to be clarified. In this study we utilized reactive (high-responsive, HR) and proactive (low-responsive, LR) rainbow trout strains to investigate how contrasting reactions to hypoxia are related to individual variation in metabolism and/or cognition. The HR-LR strains did not differ in standard metabolic rate or hypoxia tolerance. HR trout displayed more pronounced avoidance to a signal cue after being conditioned with hypoxia, suggesting that they experienced this stimulus more aversive than LR trout. Together with differences in forebrain c-fos activation patterns in dorsomedial pallium, these results suggest cognitive differences between the strains. These results demonstrate that differences in personality/stress coping style can be related to contrasts in cognition, which are independent of metabolic differences."

The Pace of Life syndrome (POLS) provides one possible explanation for maintenance of personality differences. POLS predicts that metabolic differences will covary with behavioural variation, with high metabolism associated with risk prone behaviour and `faster' life histories (e.g., high growth, early maturation). We used a repeated measures approach, assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported."

We repeatedly measured startle response durations and MR during each observation. We used double hierarchical generalized linear models to ask whether among and IIV in behaviour was underpinned by MR. We found no association between the mean duration of the startle responses and either routine MR orMR during startle response. Nevertheless, we found that IIV increased with MR during startle responses and decreased with routine MR. These results indicate that crabs with higher MR during startle responses behave less predictably, and that predictability is reduced during exposure to elevated temperatures."

Initially-bold trout became shyer regardless of group composition, whereas shy trout remained shy demonstrating that bold individuals are more plastic. Stress-induced plasma cortisol reflected the original personality of fish but not the personality induced by the treatment, irrespective of population personality. Change in boldness of bold trout may indicate preference towards initially subordinate behaviour when joining a new population. However, here we provide further evidence that behavioural and physiological parameters of coping styles may become uncoupled whereby behavioural changes are not correlated with stress responsiveness."

More active females had lower baseline Cort than less active individuals. Exploratory tendency and neophobia did not co-vary with baseline Cort. Stress-induced Cort concentrations were correlated negatively with exploratory tendency and haematocrit, but positively with mass gain in captivity. Therefore, baseline and stress-induced Cort concentrations in wintering blue tits were associated with state-dependent variables, sex, age and personality traits.

However, most studies of animal personality are conducted in the laboratory or involve experimental protocols. Here, we used longitudinal scan and all-occurrence data collected under naturalistic conditions over 21 years to study boldness, aggressiveness, and sociability in a wild population of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). We found significant variation among individual hyenas in all three traits; however, whereas both sexes exhibited consistent inter-individual differences in aggressiveness and sociability, males were less consistent than females in their boldness. Heritability and maternal effects were small but significant for both boldness and sociability. A large proportion of the variation in aggressiveness could be attributed to genetic and maternal effects, supporting previous research linking hormone exposure in utero to aggressive behaviour later in life. All three traits were correlated with at least one measure of fitness. Particularly aggressive females were more successful in raising their offspring to reproductive maturity than less aggressive females. Interestingly, the reproductive benefits of sociability depended on social rank; for low-ranking hyenas, gaining feeding tolerance via sociability may significantly enhance reproductive success. Both boldness and sociability were linked to survival, but these traits affected longevity in different ways; highly social hyenas lived longer than those that were less social, but selection on boldness was stabilizing, favoring hyenas with intermediate boldness values that balance the benefits of risky behaviour against risks of injury and death."

We developed a struggle test as an assay for docility, which is particularly amenable to field studies. The struggle test was effective, and repeatable inter-individual docility differences were observed. Sex, but not population, influenced docility scores, with male sharks being less docile than females. This difference is likely due to the contrasting role each sex plays during mating. We also found individualized lateralization. However, no individual-level relationship between lateralization and docility was detected.

We identified three personality dimensions: Assertiveness, Excitability, and Persistence. Individuals received similar scores for these dimensions in the two tests, suggesting consistent differences across context. High-Assertiveness animals showed risky behaviour, and had lower baseline cortisol. Assertiveness corresponds to `proactive-reactive coping' described for other rodents. High-Excitability animals were scored as high for Anxious and Fearful; this dimension may correspond to `emotional-reactivity' described in rats.

PC-2 loaded strongly with measures from emergence and predator-exposure tests; we interpreted it as the closest approximation of boldness. PC-1 and PC-3 described different aspects of feeding such as foraging activity and rate, respectively.

Dominant males showed higher mating effort, but did not exhibit any relationship between risk-taking and mating effort. Subordinate males exhibited a cross-context correlation, as males were either more willing to take risks and aggressive or more hesitant to take risks and nonaggressive.

Specifically, animal personality research should consider the potential role of stable conflict and post-conflict behavioural tendencies. We focus our discussion primarily on examples in nonhuman primates and humans, but suggest that individual variation patterns are relevant for any social species in which these phenomena exist. In highly gregarious species, an individual's conflict and post-conflict tendencies can affect the strength and stability of its social bonds. Because social relationships in turn impact survival and reproductive success, we also encourage future work to investigate the ultimate (i.e., fitness-relevant) consequences of individual variation in aggressive and peaceful behaviour."

Recently, it has been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result, certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications-from the way we conduct ecological research to the management and conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable? Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing) in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5 behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of animals to novelty."

Because thermal environments in which animals can behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e., multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how animals respond to rapidly changing environments."

Estimates of repeatability of emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions. Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as well as morphology."

These sheep had been housed in either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions in order to manipulate their long-term mood. When the sheep were exposed to the stimuli, we measured general activity, ear movements, ear postures and frontal cortical haemodynamic changes as indicator variables for their emotional reaction. In the meta-analysis presented here, we searched for effects of the presumed valence and mood state on the indicator variables. Furthermore, we investigated the unexplained between- versus within-subject variability as an indicator of personality. Deoxy- {[}HHb] and oxy-haemoglobin concentrations {[}O(2)Hb] as well as general activity showed weak linear relationships with presumed valence. Sheep from the unpredictable, stimulus-poor housing conditions were generally more active and showed more ear movements, higher absolute {[}HHb], more transverse ears and less left-forward ears than sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich housing conditions. However, these differences were small. The ratio of between- to within-individual variability was very low indicating little consistency in individual reactions. In conclusion, we found only weak evidence that presumed valence had a consistent effect on the indicator variables for emotional reactions in a given sheep, and these reactions were not modulated by presumed mood. Also, there was little indication that the sheep reacted in a way reflecting an individualised personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, not all individuals housed under such conditions develop stereotypic behaviours. One hypothesis to explain such variation is personality (i.e. individual) differences. We tested this hypothesis in the African striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus and predicted that stereotypic individuals would have a bolder personality and a proactive coping style than non-stereotypic individuals. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, adult stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice were tested for their personality using three tests (i.e. light-dark, startle-response and novel-object tests). Subsequently, we recorded the behaviours of individuals every second day for 30 days in standard laboratory housing. Stereotypic striped mice were proactive and showed a bolder personality type by spending longer time in the light compartment after a startle response, showed greater manipulation of cage objects and were more active than non-stereotypic individuals in standard housing. In the second experiment, we tested the personality of juvenile striped mice before the onset of stereotypic behaviours. Again, the startle response test correlated with the onset of stereotypic behaviour in adults, with stereotypic mice that spent more time in the light compartment (i.e. bolder) showing a greater likelihood of displaying stereotypic behaviours later. Although our data provides support for the association between personality and stereotypic behaviour, these group-level effects (stereotypic vs. non-stereotypic) were not evident at the individual level, particularly for stereotypic mice. Therefore, having a proactive coping style did not predict the onset of stereotypic behaviour for all stereotypic individuals, highlighting individual trajectories for the development of stereotypic behaviours.

Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and exploration) were repeatable.

A complex social environment enhances an individual's social skills and competence in many animal taxa. Consequently, complete social deprivation seriously impairs various aspects of behaviour, development, brain function and hormone levels. Although sexual selection is a major evolutionary force, studies investigating the effects of social environment on the development of reproductive behaviour are scarce. Thus, we aimed to examine how long-term social deprivation influenced sexual behaviour in both sexes of Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a biparental cichlid fish with mutual mate choice. In particular, we focused on intersexual behaviour, i.e. courtship and intrasexual aggression of fish reared and maintained either in a group or in isolation. We found significant differences between socially deprived and group-reared fish. Males and females reared in isolation were less likely to perform courtship behaviour and showed less interest towards potential mates than group-reared fish. Intrasexual aggression of isolated fish was reduced as well in both sexes. Furthermore, in males we found positive behavioural correlations between inter-and intrasexual behaviour at the individual level independent from the social-rearing environment. In females, this correlation was only found in group-reared fish, indicating an effect of social environment on behavioural correlations. Consequently, our results suggest that long-term social isolation seriously impairs social competence of P. taeniatus in sexual selection. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Despite emerging evidence that individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibited idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persisted across days, with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75\% of the time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. similar to 50\% of the time). These individual differences were robust to group composition. Surprisingly, these differences did not persist when individuals were tested in isolation, but returned when testing was once again done in groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context. Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences.

As timely and promising as this field is, its development has come with a diversity of research questions. As an unfortunate consequence, it now suffers from substantial confusion about what animal personality' is, and how relevant related research frameworks are. Here, we stress the current inconsistencies and sources of confusion pertaining to the field, and their consequences on terminology used and miscommunication between researchers. In an attempt to unravel and clarify the concepts underlying the field, we identify two distinct, but complementary, theory-driven conceptual frameworks: the intra-individual variability (IIV) approach and the life-history (LH) approach, which we believe encompass the vast majority of existing personality studies'. Finally, we argue in favour of theory-driven studies of consistent behavioural differences and state that the integrative statistical properties of random regression models should not override the merit of alternative conceptual frameworks. We then provide brief guidelines and warnings for a parsimonious and sound use of terminology."

During ontogeny, environmental influences may play an important role in shaping an individual's personality as well as its physiology. Seasonal changes are ubiquitous and known to influence development. To study developmental plasticity, of behaviour and physiology in the wild cavy (Cavia aperea), we manipulated the photoperiod in a fully crossed match-mismatch design by simulating spring and autumn photoperiod until weaning and subsequently moving half of the animals into the mismatching photoperiod. We found developmental plasticity in behavioural and physiological traits before and after sexual maturation for growth, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness. For fearlessness, changes in response to the opposite photoperiod were more pronounced in males than in females. Exploration and boldness were only influenced by early, but not by late photoperiod. No sex differences were found for these two traits. Even though our treatment changed average trait expression, some behavioural traits proved consistent over time, but physiological traits were not. Fearlessness was consistent only in animals that did not change photoperiod during development, whereas exploration and boldness were consistent over time regardless of photoperiodic treatment. Our study shows that in response to a change in photoperiod personality traits differ substantially in developmental plasticity."

Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments.

Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly.

Aquatic animal systems are more vulnerable to biological invasion when the temperature rises. Animal personality also plays an important role in the possibility of successful establishment of invasive species. However, it is still unclear how personality traits of invasive species will respond to global warming. This study focuses on juveniles of red swamp crawfish Procambarus clarkii, an invasive poikilothermic species with wide distribution throughout the world, and explores how slight temperature increases influence three personality traits (activity, boldness and aggressiveness) of P. clarkii. For each personality, individual variation is to be presented in condition of the same temperature. Individual personality values can significantly increase with the subtle rising of water temperature. Significant correlations among activity, boldness and aggressiveness are found at any temperature stage, and such relationships are maintained at a similar level in the face of different temperatures. It is most likely that significant expressions of personality traits may be an ecological compensation strategy to offset increased metabolic costs when faced with small temperature increases. Aggression syndromes are formed due to stable linkages between personality traits, in order to acquire allopatric resources efficiently and establish a new population in this species."

Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays, and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease dynamics and social structure."

Research covering these 2 phenomena has proceeded largely in isolation, and the rich behavioral lives of bacteria have not yet been studied with consistent interindividual behavioral differences in mind. Yet, the parallels between animal and bacterial behavior that are increasingly being uncovered, as well as the particular characteristics of bacteria, point toward a new approach in the study of consistent individual variation in behavior. Using bacteria can bring fruitful opportunities to the field and allows researchers to address questions that are very difficult to pursue using animal model systems. Notwithstanding a few challenges, bacteria can provide an alternative study system that may elucidate several evolutionary and ecological aspects of consistent individual behavioral variation."

Nevertheless, the study of the ecological consequences of personality is a newer field that could shed light on cases of alien species introductions. The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is frequently introduced worldwide and affects the abundance of newts, having an especially negative impact on an alternative phenotype, the paedomorph, which maintains larval traits at the adult stage, unlike the other phenotype, the metamorph, which has undergone metamorphosis. We experimentally assessed the impact of goldfish on the foraging behavior of both phenotypes of palmate newts (Lissotriton helveticus). More particularly, we assessed fish personality by analyzing the foraging activity and the aggressiveness toward newts, and newt personality by analyzing individual difference in boldness. In the presence of fish, fewer newts foraged than in their absence, and paedomorphs were more affected than metamorphs. We found strong personality differences in fish and fewer newts foraged in the presence of a more aggressive fish. Newts differed in boldness, but fish aggressiveness remains a key factor to explain newt behavior. Studying behavioral interactions between native and alien species helps to understand the mechanisms of coexistence and exclusion and why different phenotypes might be affected differently by the same threat. To a great extent, not only the presence of fish alters the foraging opportunities of newts but also the personality of the invader; integrating personality patterns of invaders is therefore a key to understanding the ecological consequences of alien species introduction."

They are increasingly being negatively affected by anthropogenic activity, which is rapidly and unpredictably altering their structure and complexity. These changes in habitat state may expose tropical animals to novel and unpredictable conditions, potentially increasing their extinction risk. However, an animal's ability to cope with environmental change may be linked to its personality. While numerous studies have investigated environmental influences on animal personalities, few are focused on tropical species. In this review, we consider how behavioural syndromes in tropical species might facilitate coping under, and adapting to, increasing disturbance. Given the complexity of tropical rainforests, we first discuss how habitat complexity influences personality traits and physiological stress in general. We then explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of personality in the tropics in the context of behavioural flexibility, range expansion and speciation. Finally, we discuss the impact that anthropogenic environmental change may have on the ecological integrity of tropical rainforests, positing scenarios for species persistence. Maintaining tropical rainforest complexity is crucial for driving behavioural flexibility and personality type, both of which are likely to be key factors facilitating long term persistence in disturbed habitats.

While analyses of behavioural repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, the correlation would be different between males and females, particularly when the sexes experience different levels of predation risk. Here, we tested this idea using a water strider species, Gerris gracilicornis (Heteroptera: Gerridae). G. gracilicornis males employ an unusual intimidating courtship strategy capitalizing on predator behaviours and female response to predators. Since mounted females are more vulnerable than males to predatory attacks from below, we predicted that changes in female mating behaviours across predation contexts (boldness in a mating context) should be associated with female antipredator behaviours (boldness in a nonmating context), but that the correlation would be weaker for male mating behaviours. In a series of behavioural assays, we measured water striders' (1) mating behaviour in the absence of predators, (2) mating behaviour in the presence of predation risk, (3) boldness in the mating context (changes in female mating behaviour after predator attacks) and (4) boldness in the nonmating context. We found that females behaved more cautiously around predators in both the mating and nonmating contexts. We also found that females' boldness in the mating context was significantly correlated with their boldness in the nonmating context. In contrast to females, antipredator behaviour of males in the nonmating context did not correlate with their boldness in the mating context. Thus we suggest that sex differences in boldness across predation contexts appear to cause sex-specific behavioural syndromes. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

One way that behaviour can evolve is to have a genetic basis. Identifying the molecular genetic basis of personality could therefore provide insight into how and why such variation is maintained, particularly in natural populations. Previously identified candidate genes for personality in birds include the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), and serotonin transporter (SERT). Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory and bold behaviours are associated with polymorphisms in both DRD4 and SERT. Here we tested for polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) population on Cousin Island, Seychelles, and then investigated correlations between personality and polymorphisms in these genes. We found no genetic variation in DRD4, but identified four polymorphisms in SERT that clustered into five haplotypes. There was no correlation between bold or exploratory behaviours and SERT polymorphisms/haplotypes. The null result was not due to lack of power, and indicates that there was no association between these behaviours and variation in the candidate genes tested in this population. These null findings provide important data to facilitate representative future meta-analyses on candidate personality genes."

Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here, we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals. Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Early differences in starting mass within litters are often predictive of individual differences in behaviour and development, although to what extent such differences are independent of (epi) genetic factors is not always clear. In our study on domestic rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, we created experimentally mixed litters consisting of either heavier or lighter pups obtained from different litters at birth and raised by foster mothers. We hypothesized that pups' body mass relative to their new littermates would determine the nature of their social interactions with consequences for their early growth, largely independent of their absolute or relative body mass in their litters of origin. As predicted, pups with a higher starting mass on postnatal day 1 compared to members of their new litter consistently had more neighbours in the litter huddle, thus reflecting their more central position. In turn, pups with more neighbours had relatively higher body temperatures, greater milk intake and a higher milk conversion ratio, resulting in relatively greater growth during the first critical postnatal week. Relative body mass in the litter of origin or absolute body mass had no notable effect, indicating that the observed developmental patterns were truly driven by pups' body mass relative to their current littermates rather than being a consequence of (epi) genetic effects potentially associated with their birth mass. In conclusion, our study underlines the importance of interactions among siblings in shaping individual differences in early growth and development largely independent of genetic factors.

A general relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild populations, which raises the question as to how variation in personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we investigated the relationship between individual personality differences and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a 1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability. Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to maintaining variation in boldness in the study population."

If males use social information and copy other males' choices, this leads to an increased likelihood of sperm competition for both, the copying and the copied male. In livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae), males appear to avoid the risk of being copied by temporarily moving away from preferred females and approaching nonpreferred ones ({''}audience effect{''}), thereby exploiting the rival's propensity to copy. Responding to rival presence with an audience effect bears the risk of losing the initially preferred female, which may swim away, but may help to reduce sperm competition intensity. Males may rate this risk-benefit ratio differentially depending on their personality, for example, more risk-taking (bolder) males might be more likely to respond to an audience. Using Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana) as our study organism, we characterized focal and audience males along the boldness-activity behavioral axis. As overall competition levels are known to affect male mate choice, we subjected half of the males to a low competition (single-male housing) and the other half to a high-competition treatment (group housing) before they were tested in binary mate choice tests. Only males from the high competition treatment responded to rival presence with an audience effect. In congruence with our prediction, bolder males within this cohort showed a stronger audience effect. Our study exemplifies that (depending on the social context) bolder, not shyer, individuals can be more responsive to their social environment."

Interspecific hybridization has the potential to alter behavioral trait correlations, but the effect of hybridization on suites of behavioral traits has received relatively little attention. We evaluated how natural hybridization changes the relationship between boldness (time of emergence and proportion of time out of shelter) and response to a simulated predator threat in swordtails (Teleostei: Xiphophorus). In poeciliid fishes, bold individuals have increased survival in the presence of predators. This non-intuitive observation may arise as a result of bold individuals being more likely to engage in anti-predator behaviors. Contrary to our prediction, bold individuals were less likely to perform a fast-start response to a predator threat. This correlation was consistent among populations and species but was only significant in hybrids. The observed correlation between boldness and anti-predator behavior could impact hybrid fitness and the evolvability of hybrid lineages. More generally, our findings suggest that hybridization could influence the integration of behavioral phenotypes, as has been amply documented for morphology.

As part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993) suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus, referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample of domestic piglets (n = 3555). By using a statistical resampling analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26 days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably represents a unimodal distribution with a `ceiling-effect'. The intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation (r(S)) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r(S) = 0.19-0.45, p < 0.001; R = 0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum from active to passive coping behaviour. This means that individuals show both behavioural consistency and flexibility in behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Public information permits faster and more accurate estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly increase their food-finding rate by using public information.

Recent work has shown that personality and behavioural flexibility might be linked, but their interaction is not well understood and could be elucidated by studying a socially flexible species. Using well-established tests, we measured the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and aggressiveness in free-living striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in South Africa. Specifically, we tested whether personality changes when individuals change their reproductive tactic, either from group-living philopatrics to solitary-living females and roaming males or from non-breeding philopatrics to breeders. Our results showed that striped mice have personalities: Individuals behaved consistently for all the behavioural traits measured both over time and contexts (breeding to non-breeding season). While most of the personality traits measured remained consistent among tactics, they did not predict which tactic an individual would adopt next, suggesting that environmental conditions rather than personality influence tactic switching. Additionally, we found important differences in the consistency of the behaviours measured between males and females, indicating that sexual selection might play a prominent role in the maintenance of personality in this species. Our study demonstrates that some personality traits can be stable over an entire lifetime even in socially flexible species and that personality does not constrain social flexibility."

However, much less is known about whether and how ecological variation across latitudinal gradients reflects behavioral variation. Ant colonies may also show behavioral variation, and Temnothorax rugatulus show a colony-level behavioral syndrome that seems to reflect risk tolerance across their North American range. While it is presumed that this pattern is the result of adaptation to local environmental conditions, which ecological factors are driving this variation are unknown. Here, we test if colony risk tolerance is affected by competition, predation, resource availability, or environmental stress at each site. Our results show that increased competition, specifically for nest sites, as well as increased spatial clustering of colonies predicts higher risk tolerance. Additionally, the spatial clustering of colonies influences the structure of the risk-taking syndrome, i.e., which colony-level behaviors are correlated and how strongly. This emphasizes the need for understanding large-scale geographic variation in behavior, as it may explain how ecological factors drive the evolution and maintenance of intraspecific behavioral variation across populations."

First, individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves. We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional relationships between individual behavior and energetics."

With the recent focus on behavioral correlations (e.g., behavioral syndromes), a fundamental question arises regarding what mechanisms may drive positive relationships between functionally distinct behaviors. Understanding these mechanisms can inform critical questions, such as why distinct behaviors are often correlated, and can also lend insights into how behavioral similarities are conserved across species. Arthropods provide an idea system to study these questions as the biogenic amines, such as octopamine and serotonin, have long been known to mediate a large number of behaviors such as aggression, dominance, escape behavior, and others. Behaviorists have several ways in which they can manipulate these biogenic amines invivo, including injection, feeding, and topical application. Topical application is potentially an optimal method for manipulating amine concentrations, given that it is minimally invasive and relatively precise. Here, we investigate the role of biogenic amines, octopamine, and serotonin, in mediating a range of similar and often correlated behaviors in two distantly related species of spiders, the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the funnel-web spider, Agelenopsis pennsylvanica. Additionally, we investigate the behavioral effects associated with three commonly used carrier solvents: dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetone. We demonstrate that biogenic amines are involved both in mediating several behaviors, and also potentially the links between different behaviors. We also show that the same behaviors in different species are not affected by biogenic amines in the same manner, suggesting differences in the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms governing behavior. Furthermore, we discovered large and pervasive effects associated with both carrier solvents, thus calling into question the potential usefulness and interpretability of topical application methods in behavioral research."

How individuals emerge from within the group as leaders, however transitory this position may be, has become an increasingly common question asked. This question is further complicated by the fact that in many of these aggregations, differences between individuals are minor and the group is largely considered to be homogeneous. In the simulations presented here, we investigate the emergence of leadership in the extreme situation in which all individuals are initially identical. Using a mathematical model developed using observations of natural systems, we show that the addition of a simple concept of leadership tendencies which is inspired by observations of natural systems and is affected by experience can produce distinct leaders and followers using a nonlinear feedback loop. Most importantly, our results show that small differences in experience can promote the rapid emergence of stable roles for leaders and followers. Our findings have implications for our understanding of adaptive behaviors in initially homogeneous groups, the role experience can play in shaping leadership tendencies, and the use of self-assessment in adapting behavior and, ultimately, self-role-assignment."

We tagged crickets and then periodically recaptured them and measured their behavior in the lab. This revealed that rather than variation in how age affects behavior, there were consistent patterns across the whole population. We do not have a situation where some crickets live fast and die young while others take it easy and slow.Investigating patterns of among and within-individual trait variation in populations is essential to understanding how selection shapes phenotypes. Behavior is often the most flexible aspect of the phenotype, and to understand how it is affected by selection, we need to examine how consistent individuals are. However, it is not well understood whether among-individual differences tend to remain consistent over lifetimes, or whether the behavior of individuals relative to one another varies over time. We examined the dynamics of 4 behavioral traits (tendency to leave a refuge, shyness, activity, and exploration) in a wild population of field crickets (Gryllus campestris). We tagged individuals and then temporarily removed them from their natural environment and tested them under laboratory conditions. All 4 traits showed among-individual variance in mean levels of expression across the adult lifespan, but no significant differences in how rapidly expression changed with age. For all traits, among-individual variance increased as individuals got older. Our findings reveal seldom examined changes in variance components over the adult lifetime of wild individuals. Such changes will have important implications for the relationship between behavioral traits, life-histories, and fitness and the consequences of selection on wild individuals."

Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in ``embodied capital{''}aEuro{''}that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital-physical strength and formal education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership. Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which suggests that prosocial traits may be ``reactively heritable{'' by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation."

For complex societies, there is considerable interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals' participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition, group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size: larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size, morphological composition and personality composition; none of these effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics.

Capuchins that were more similar in Neuroticism had higher affiliative relationship scores, while capuchins that were more similar in Sociability shared overall higher-quality relationships (i.e. the difference between the dyad's affiliative and agonistic scores).

Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability). However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power. Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability, and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies. Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time (if present).

Studies aiming to do this typically assay personality in captivity and rely on the assumption that measures of traits in the laboratory reflect their expression in nature. We examined this rarely tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity. We focused on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies: shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly context-specific. Our results highlight the importance of validating the relevance of laboratory behavioural assays to analogous traits measured in the wild."

In this study, we investigate animal personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional factors, which are not directly measurable, but which predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the consistency of inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards novelty in 47 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised in identical housing conditions. Different stages of approach behaviour towards novelty, and how these related within and across contexts, were explored. Our experimental design contained four tests: two novel object tests (non-social contexts) and two novel animated stimuli tests (social contexts). Our results showed consistency in shyness measures across multiple tests, indicating the existence of personality in farmed American mink. It was found that consistency in shyness measures differs across non-social and social contexts, as well as across the various stages in the approach towards novel objects, revealing that different aspects of shyness exist in the farmed American mink. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum in the American mink. Since the mink were raised in identical housing conditions, inherited factors may have been important in shaping the consistent inter-individual variation. Body weight and sex had no effect on the personality of the mink. Altogether, our results suggest that the shyness-boldness continuum cannot be explained by a simple underlying dispositional factor, but instead encompasses a broader term of hesitating behaviour that might comprise several different personality traits."

Inland recreational fisheries offer unique opportunities for the study of fisheries induced evolution due to the ability to replicate study systems, limited gene flow among populations, and the existence of unexploited reference populations. Experimental research has demonstrated that angling vulnerability is heritable in Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, and is correlated with elevated resting metabolic rates (RMR) and higher fitness. However, whether such differences are present in wild populations is unclear. This study sought to quantify differences in RMR among replicated exploited and unexploited populations of Largemouth Bass. We collected age-0 Largemouth Bass from two Connecticut drinking water reservoirs unexploited by anglers for almost a century, and two exploited lakes, then transported and reared them in the same pond. Field RMR of individuals from each population was quantified using intermittent-flow respirometry. Individuals from unexploited reservoirs had a significantly higher mean RMR (6\%) than individuals from exploited populations. These findings are consistent with expectations derived from artificial selection by angling on Largemouth Bass, suggesting that recreational angling may act as an evolutionary force influencing the metabolic rates of fishes in the wild. Reduced RMR as a result of fisheries induced evolution may have ecosystem level effects on energy demand, and be common in exploited recreational populations globally."

In particular, many established evolutionary theories of dispersal highlight the importance of the social environment. More recent research in behavioral ecology has focused on the importance of individual behavioral phenotypes. We reviewed the literature on individual behavioral phenotypes and dispersal and suggest that how individual behavioral phenotypes interact with the immediate social environment experienced by individuals in influencing dispersal is still poorly understood, despite growing interest. We found that very few studies had examined the interaction of individual behavioral phenotypes and social factors, and behavioral phenotypes related to social tendencies were less commonly measured than were behavioral phenotypes related to exploration or response to risk. Further, and unsurprisingly, studies on social behavioral phenotypes and dispersal behaviors during the transience stage of dispersal were underrepresented compared to the departure or settlement stages. Future studies in this area should aim to: a) make explicit links between behavioral traits and their proposed effects on dispersal decisions throughout multiple stages of dispersal, b) integrate more continuous dispersal variables, and c) consider the effects of the spatial distribution and phenotypes of conspecifics (i.e., the social landscape) encountered by individual dispersers."

Fifty five percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish. These results add to the growing body of information on within-species variation in learning strategies and suggest a possible influence of stress coping style on the use of associative learning as opposed to algorithmic searching during foraging.

We experimentally investigated the effects of carotenoid availability on exploratory behavior and activity level, using adult males and females of two species of waterfowl: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail (Anas acuta). We assessed behavior using a novel-environment test designed to measure an individual's response to novel objects and a potential predator threat (fox urine scent). We found that carotenoid availability was positively associated with some aspects of exploratory behavior: birds with higher concentrations of circulating carotenoids entered the test arena sooner and approached and entered predator-scented bedding material more frequently than birds with low carotenoid concentrations. These results suggest that the availability of carotenoid resources can influence personality traits in waterfowl, and we discuss putative physiological mechanisms underlying this effect.

We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation, aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact. By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and long-term).

We used three different stimulations, adapting a protocol established for octopuses (Mather and Anderson, 1993) to assess individual differences (personalities). In the ``alerting test{''} the behaviour was scored after the human observer lifted the cover of the tank. In the ``threat test{''} the behaviour was scored after the animal was touched with a stick. In the ``feeding test{''} the behaviour was scored after the animal was given a live prey. The relationship among behavioural responses was analysed by principal component analysis, which allowed identifying three dimensions along which individual differences were maximal, accounting for 39.6, 15.6, and 10.3\% of the total variance. We found marked individual differences that were consistent across the three tests with respect to behaviours such as floating, staying at the bottom of the tank, and moving the fins. However, behaviours such as ``moving{''} and ``changes in body patterning{''} showed context-dependent variation. This study provides evidence of personality dimensions in cuttlefish with implications about welfare of cephalopods used in research in view of the new EU regulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids (GCs) in eggs, as a signal of maternal stress, affect offspring behavioural traits. To date, research has focused on effects of egg GCs on offspring behaviours within a single experimental context. Little is known regarding how egg GCs affect relationships among behaviours and across ecological contexts (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We explored how exogenously increased egg cortisol shapes behavioural syndromes of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. Social dominance during a territory intrusion and boldness following a simulated predator attack were recorded for juvenile coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated and untreated eggs. When exposed to a conspecific intruder, coho salmon treated with cortisol in ovo increased dominance behaviours, whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced these behaviours. Following exposure to a simulated predator attack, coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated eggs increased boldness (i.e. increased activity and feeding; reduced shelter use), whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced boldness. A dominance-boldness relationship was observed for coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated, but not untreated, eggs; dominance during the territory intrusion positively correlated with boldness under threat of predation. Our results highlight the complex influence of egg GCs on offspring behaviour and behavioural syndromes. Continued investigation into the outcomes of egg GCs on offspring will broaden our understanding of intergenerational components of the hormone-behaviour nexus.

Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r = 0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be related to either of two measures of public information use. While the personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious avenue for further research."

Social spiders are an emerging model for studying animal personality in social systems and our study was motivated by the lack of work examining the persistence of personality in the long-term and under changed conditions. We examined consistency and plasticity in two key behaviours, prey capture and web maintenance, and tested for the presence of a behavioural syndrome between them in the social spider, Stegodyphus sarasinorum. Our experiments over a large part of the adult life span show that not all spiders capture prey, suggesting behavioural consistency with implications for task differentiation. Through prey manipulation experiments, we further probed the role of hunger, proximity to prey, body weight and number of days into the experiment on individual propensity to capture prey. Our results demonstrate that under altered prey availability, responses of individuals are plastic and influenced by hunger. These results suggest that behavioural consistency can be modulated significantly by extrinsic factors. In contrast, we did not find consistent differences between individuals in their participation during web maintenance. Additionally, we did not find a behavioural syndrome. Together, these results suggest a scenario of quasi-specialisation in which there is no strict partitioning of tasks. For the first time, our results demonstrate behavioural consistency over extended periods of time in social spiders and have implications for colony efficiency and survival. We argue that studies spanning ecologically relevant time periods and environmental variation can reveal the full extent of behavioural consistency and flexibility."

Although there is some evidence that differences in personality among individuals within populations can be genetically based and adaptive, when and how individual personality differences emerge in a population is not well understood, but of considerable general interest. Here, using juveniles of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) as a model system, we investigated in the laboratory whether individuals consistently differ in their personalities and whether behavioral syndromes are apparent at an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality traits are heritable. Under standardized laboratory conditions and using sibling analysis, we quantified interindividual differences in their boldness behavior under potential predation threat and their exploratory activity in a novel environment, 2 ecologically important behaviors, as our focal personality traits and estimated their respective repeatability and heritability. We report for the first time consistent (repeatable) and heritable individual differences in boldness and exploratory behaviors, and a boldness-exploration behavioral syndrome, in young convict cichlids. Bolder fish were more exploratory than relatively timid ones. These results provide novel evidence for the emergence in early life history of consistent individual differences in personality traits and behavioral syndromes in this species and suggest that genetic variation for boldness and exploratory behaviors, and thus potential for selection on these traits, exists in our study population."

Evidence for selection acting on personality is biased toward species where behavioral and life-history information can readily be collected in the wild, such as ungulates and passerine birds. Here, we report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow, flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed. Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance. Our findings, therefore, forcefully demonstrate that personality variation exists in wild insects and that it is associated with components of fitness."

Different hypotheses have been developed to explain why personality variation is maintained within populations, most likely via processes of balancing selection. One mechanism discussed is that combinations of similar personalities within breeding pairs could increase fitness. We investigated this purported mechanism by studying the association between personality combinations within nulliparous pairs and their onset of reproduction in a monogamous rodent, the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. In seasonal iteroparous breeders, reproductive timing is relevant to fitness, as a delayed onset of breeding potentially limits the number of breeding occasions and lowers the chance that offspring will start reproducing during the same season. Repeated standardized tests carried out prior to pairing revealed consistent individual differences in subjects' behavioural responses with respect to anxiety and exploratory activity, indicating the existence of personality types. Within-pair similarity in anxiety levels affected the chance of reproduction: pairs with similar anxiety scores had a higher probability of breeding, and were quicker to start, during the observation period, independently of the scores of both partners of the pair. We propose that this association between `personality matching' and the onset of reproduction could have important life history consequences in this species and might be one of the mechanisms leading to the maintenance of personality variation within populations.

The steroid hormone testosterone in particular has an important activational role in mediating short-term aggressive responses to social and environmental stimuli within many vertebrate systems. We conducted two complementary experiments designed to investigate the activational relationship between testosterone and aggression in male Egernia whitii, a social lizard species. First, we investigated whether a conspecific aggressive challenge induced a testosterone response and second, we artificially manipulated testosterone concentrations to examine whether this changed aggression levels. We found that at the mean level, plasma T concentration did not appear to be influenced by an aggression challenge. However, there was a slight indication that receiving a challenge may influence intra-individual consistency of plasma T concentrations, with individuals not receiving an aggression challenge maintaining consistency in their circulating testosterone concentrations, while those individuals that received a challenge did not. Manipulating circulating testosterone concentrations had no influence on either mean-level or individual-level aggression. Combined with our previous work, our study adds increasing evidence that the relationship between testosterone and aggression is not straightforward, and promotes the investigation of alternative hormonal pathways and differences in neuro-synthesis and neuroendocrine pathways to account for species variable testosterone - aggression links."

The present study evaluated gregariousness as a personality trait in 14 ewes kept on pasture. Gregariousness was defined based on the frequency of having a close neighbour (<3 m). Highly gregarious (HG) and less gregarious (LG) animals were separated into two groups (n = 7) which were reintegrated after 18 days. During direct field observations, behaviour was recorded individually every 15 min. Each session lasted 2.5 h (08.30-11.00 h or 1430-17.00 h, respectively). Behavioural synchronization was highest when the group consisted only of HG individuals (K-HG = 0.69, K-LG =0.31; t=5.29; p <0.001), indicating that gregariousness predicted behavioural synchronization in sheep. Though sheep are generally recognized as a highly gregarious species, HG and LG individuals could be differentiated clearly and consistently.

However, context dependency of dispersal decisions, such as effects of social interactions and resource availability, is rarely disentangled from intrinsic factors, such as animal personality. Western bluebirds provide a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors in dispersal decisions because they display distinct aggressive personality types, have high recruitment of sons to the natal population, and depend on nest cavities, a resource that is easy to quantify. Here, we measured territorial interactions among kin and non-kin, resource availability, and aggressive behavior over an 11-year period to determine how they influenced dispersal decisions of male offspring. We found that distance dispersed from kin was driven by a male's own aggression, the aggression of his nearest kin, and the resources available on the natal territory. Both aggressive males and males with aggressive kin dispersed longer distances, as did males who had fewer resources on their natal territories. Thus, dispersal in this species is influenced jointly by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Because resource acquisition and personality type are interdependent in this species, changes in the social environment are likely to have important consequences for population dynamics."

Highly productive individuals, with high growth rates and high fecundity, are assumed to live life at a fast pace showing high levels of boldness and risk taking, compared with less productive individuals. Here, we investigate among-individual differences in mean boldness (the inverse of the latency to recover from a startling stimulus) and in the consistency of boldness, in male hermit crabs in relation to two aspects of life-history investment. We assessed aerobic scope by measuring the concentration of the respiratory pigment haemocyanin, and we assessed fecundity by measuring spermatophore size. First, we found that individuals investing in large spermatophores also had high concentrations of haemocyanin. Using doubly hierarchical-generalized linear models to analyse longitudinal data on startle responses, we show that hermit crabs vary both in their mean response durations and in the consistency of their behaviour. Individual consistency was unrelated to haemocyanin concentration or spermatophore size, but mean startle response duration increased with spermatophore size. Thus, counter to expectations, it was the most risk-averse individuals, rather than the boldest and most risk prone, that were the most productive. We suggest that similar patterns should be present in other species, if the most productive individuals avoid risky behaviour."

Indeed, few authors have investigated the role of other important spatial traits such as home range, movement distance, vertical activity, and site fidelity, and it is not clear whether these behaviors are correlated with dispersal. In this study, we investigated individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior: repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors, indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable, cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range, movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast, behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from ``resident{''} individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity, and minimal movement to ``mobile{''} individuals with large home ranges, high movement rates, and little site fidelity. Our findings suggest animal personality can play a key role in shaping the space use of individuals, and this diversity in spatial behaviors may be too complex to be captured by often used simple linear measures of dispersal."

Over 2 years we found significant within-individual consistency and interindividual variation in the foraging group sizes of 171 females. Network analysis comparisons of 103 females between the years, using HWIG (an association index that controls for gregariousness), showed that individuals were also highly consistent in their social network measures. We tested the boldness of 51 of these females 6-21 times each over 18 months, using flight initiation distance tests; individuals were also highly consistent in this measure of personality. Shy females had significantly larger mean foraging group sizes. After controlling for gregariousness and space use, shy females had fewer preferred associates than bolder females.

If personalities are adaptive, the balance between consistency and flexibility of behavioural traits should reflect the ability of individuals to detect and respond to changing conditions in an appropriate and timely manner and, thus, depend upon the pace and predictability of changing conditions. We investigated the balance between individual consistency and flexibility in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus by assaying boldness across the diel cycle and correlating these data with patterns of prey and threat abundance in the natural habitat. We found significant diel flexibility in boldness correlating with drastic and predictable changes in prey availability. Moreover, the strength of within-individual flexibility in boldness was comparable to the strength of rank-order consistency among individuals. We also found evidence that mean boldness level and among-individual variation in boldness are correlated with reproductive status. These data emphasize the interplay between behavioural consistency and flexibility and suggest that temporal characteristics of ecological conditions may be vital in assessing the strength, stability and adaptive value of animal personalities.

The fields of animal personality and ecological immunology each aim to understand variation and covariation of behavioural and immune traits. Studying these traits together may provide additional insight into patterns of (co)variation than studying behaviours or immunity in isolation, as trade-offs between behaviour and immunity are likely. Hormonal mechanisms may be involved in the variation and covariation between behavioural and immune traits, and the role of receptors in particular has rarely been tested in wild animals. In wild-caught Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, we delivered mifepristone to experimentally block the actions of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), a component of the stress response. Then we evaluated whether cortisol binding with GRs affects the plasticity of behavioural and immune traits, consistent individual differences and phenotypic integration of exploratory behaviour, activity, antipredator behaviour, response to restraint and bacteria-killing ability, a measure of innate immunity. Mifepristone treatment abolished relationships between faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels and both exploratory behaviour and bacteria-killing ability. This result indicates that cortisol binding with GRs is a mechanism of plasticity of those traits. Mifepristone also affected relationships among traits. Specifically, mifepristone treatment significantly modulated the relationships between bacteria-killing ability and two behaviours, exploration and activity. This result supports the hypothesis that the GR-cortisol binding is a mechanism of phenotypic integration. Together, these results suggest that GR-cortisol binding balances the often observed trade-off between behaviour and immunity to produce patterns of (co)variation of behavioural and immune traits seen in nature.

Here we tested the potential for behavioural similarity within mated pairs of wild eastern bluebirds to impact reproductive success. Specifically, we quantified nest defence behaviour of males and females to address three hypotheses: (1) the individual personality hypothesis, which predicts that individuals with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging; (2) the pair coordination hypothesis, which predicts similarly behaving pairs will have more nestlings survive to fledging; and (3) the pair intensity hypothesis, which predicts pairs with more aggressive personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging. Pairs that had similar nest defence strategies produced more fledglings in support of the pair coordination hypothesis. We found no support for either the individual personality hypothesis or the pair intensity hypothesis.

While there is increasing scientific attention on the development and evaluation of behavioural tests used to assess personality, a lack of robust assessment of the validity and reliability of many test protocols currently in use `on the ground' has led to the repeated questioning of their use by both the scientific community and the public. This is particularly prevalent within the welfare sector, where consequences for dogs that are identified as behaviourally unsuitable for rehoming are dire. Despite the large body of work dedicated to canine personality and behavioural test development, relatively few reported protocols have been demonstrated to accurately and reliably predict behavioural traits in dogs, according to accepted validation and reliability assessment protocols used by psychologists. Inconsistencies in the terminology used to describe behaviour, tests and canine personality are common within the literature pertaining to applied personality testing of dogs, making discussion of the usefulness of such tests within the applied environment difficult. Furthermore, highly relevant information gained from the fields of psychology and ethology, such as the limitations of behaviour-only scoring systems, the need to assess both temporal and contextual stability during personality testing, and the effects of arousal, impulsivity and affective state on behaviour, is seemingly overlooked by some test developers, resulting in array of test protocols that suffer from similar, predictable design limitations. This review discusses the most prominent considerations and limitations relevant to the assessment of personality through behavioural tests in domestic dogs, and suggests possible mechanisms through which these limitations may be investigated and addressed. In particular, it is recommended that the results of shelter-based behavioural test batteries are interpreted within the limitations of the context in which they are performed, and test developers consider other methods with which personality may be assessed within the shelter environment.

For example, the presence of highly interactive individuals, or hubs, influences the extent and rate of information spread across a network. In a network of interactions, the duration over which individual variation in interactions persists may affect how the network operates. Individuals may persist in their behavior over time and across situations, often referred to as personality. Colonies of social insects are an example of a biological system in which the structure of the coordinated networks of interacting workers may greatly influence information flow within the colony, and therefore its collective behavior. Here I investigate the effects of persistence in walking patterns on interaction networks using computer simulations that are parameterized using observed behavior of harvester ants. I examine how the duration of persistence in spatial behavior influences network structure. Furthermore, I explore how spatial features of the environment affect the relationship between persistent behavior and network structure. I show that as persistence increases, the skewness of the weighted degree distribution of the interaction network increases.

The evolutionary costs and benefits of certain personality traits are frequently assumed to fluctuate across different life history stages. However, little is still known about survival consequences of personality during juvenile life. We predicted survival costs of exploration tendency in juvenile European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which we studied under quasi-natural conditions. In addition, consistencies between exploration and the animal's behavioral responses in other contexts were tested. Early exploratory behavior was assessed in two annual cohorts, either observationally by quantifying the time course of exploring the area around the nursery burrow shortly after emergence above ground or experimentally by conducting open-field tests shortly before emergence. In both years, the study revealed consistent results: more exploratory individuals had a lower chance of survival until the end of the vegetation period, presumably due to a higher predation risk. Fast explorers, as assessed by their exploration of the burrow environment, were also less sociable and tended to be more aggressive toward conspecifics as subadults. Sociability was repeatable across time. Furthermore, fast explorers, as assessed by their open-field behavior, were bolder in a handling test before emergence. These consistencies across context and time suggest the existence of personality. In conclusion, the results provide evidence for survival costs of fast exploration during juvenile life. The findings are in line with predictions on personality-related life history variation."

Many authors hypothesize that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results. New statistical methods that partition correlations into between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration, and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration. Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent, which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes, feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between them."

We asked (1) whether activity could be considered to be a personality trait, (2) whether this trait is connected to survival, and (3) whether personality and survival exhibit sex differences. We found that activity fulfilled the criteria of personality as individuals had consistent between-individual differences over time and across situations. Consistent individual differences in activity were associated with fitness as the survival probability of active individuals was lower, but this did not depend on sex. Our results demonstrate that personality exists in I. balthica and support recent suggestions that the association between personality and life-history traits is a central component in mediating animal personality."

Yet, optimal reproductive decisions likely vary owing to among-individual differences in environmental sensitivity. Specifically, `proactive' individuals who do not track environmental changes may be less able to produce optimal brood sizes than `reactive' individuals who have more precise local environmental knowledge. To test this, we quantified exploratory behaviour (a proxy for proactivity) in a great tit (Parus major) population, manipulated brood sizes (reduced, control, enlarged) and evaluated whether individuals of dissimilar coping style differed in their level of optimization. If reactive females behaved optimally, any deviation from their original brood size should lower fitness, whereas this should not be the case for proactive females. Reactive females indeed performed best at their natural brood size, whereas proactive females performed best when raising an enlarged brood. These findings imply that proactive females produced sub-optimal brood sizes. We speculate that proactive females might (i) take decisions based on biased perception of their environment, (ii) face energetic constraints in offspring production and/or (iii) be more willing to invest into current reproduction when given the option. Our findings provide experimental evidence for coping style-related differences in optimal reproductive decisions and life-history strategies."

Recent theory predicts a correlation between individual personality and life-history strategy, and from this comes the prediction that personality may predict the intensity of senescence. Here we show that boldness correlates with reproductive success and foraging behaviour in wandering albatrosses, with strong sex-specific differences. Shy males show a strong decline in reproductive performance with age, and bold females have lower reproductive success in later adulthood. In both sexes, bolder birds have longer foraging trips and gain more mass per trip as they get older. However, the benefit of this behaviour appears to differ between the sexes, such that it is only matched by high reproductive success in males. Together our results suggest that personality linked foraging adaptations with age are strongly sex-specific in their fitness benefits and that the impact of boldness on senescence is linked to ecological parameters."

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52\% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified."

Here, we use a wild population of red squirrels to examine changes in activity and aggression from juvenile to yearling life stages. Personality may change at the individual level (individual stability), population level (mean level stability), and relative to other individuals (differential stability). We calculated all three types of stability, as well as the structural stability of the activity-aggression behavioural syndrome. Within individuals, both activity and aggression scores regressed towards the mean. Differential stability was maintained for activity, but not aggression. Structural stability was maintained; however, the activity-aggression correlation increased in squirrels that gained territories later in the season. These results suggest that personality undergoes some changes as animals mature, and that the ontogeny of personality can be linked to environmental changes."

Both personality and cognition have important fitness consequences, and it has been proposed that variation in cognition could be functionally related to variation in personality. Here, we test this hypothesis using three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model and adopt a classic T-maze with food reward experimental paradigm. We first confirmed that fish choose the correct arm of the maze significantly more than would be expected by chance and that this improves with trial number. We then explored predictors of individual differences in the speed (time to making a decision) and accuracy (whether the first decision is correct) in decision making. We find bolder behavioral types (who tend to be male) arrive at the correct decision sooner than their shyer conspecifics. However, boldness was not related to decision accuracy. Moreover, we did not find any significant difference in fish's improvement in decision accuracy over successive trials according to boldness or sex. This suggests that although bolder fish may acquire information more quickly because they make decisions faster, they do not differ from shyer conspecifics in their decision-making accuracy. The absence of such a trade-off might offer a functional explanation for why, in stickleback fish and many other species, bolder individuals tend to initiate movement and shyer individuals to follow-bold leaders may result in faster group decisions without compromising accuracy."

For mammals, mother's milk is an important physiological pathway for nutrient transfer and glucocorticoid signaling that potentially influences offspring growth and behavioral phenotype. Glucocorticoids in mother's milk have been associated with offspring behavioral phenotype in several mammals, but studies have been handicapped by not simultaneously evaluating milk energy density and yield. This is problematic as milk glucocorticoids and nutrients likely have simultaneous effects on offspring phenotype. We investigated mother's milk and infant temperament and growth in a cohort of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant dyads at the California National Primate Research Center (N = 108). Glucocorticoids in mother's milk, independent of available milk energy, predicted a more Nervous, less Confident temperament in both sons and daughters. We additionally found sex differences in the windows of sensitivity and the magnitude of sensitivity to maternal-origin glucocorticoids. Lower parity mothers produced milk with higher cortisol concentrations. Lastly, higher cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant weight gain across time. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers with fewer somatic resources, even in captivity, may be ``programming{''} through cortisol signaling, behaviorally cautious offspring that prioritize growth. Glucocorticoids ingested through milk may importantly contribute to the assimilation of available milk energy, development of temperament, and orchestrate, in part, the allocation of maternal milk energy between growth and behavioral phenotype."

There has been particularly strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we used an `expert-categorization' procedure a standardized method often used in the course of meta-analyses to identify the subset of those assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity, aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration, fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness, trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a standardized categorization procedure undertaken.independently by six expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test batteries.

A positive or negative covariance between these two mating outcomes could substantially increase or decrease overall variation in male expected reproductive success, yet the relationship between these mating outcomes is relatively understudied. We examined this relationship and the influence of male personality traits, female personality traits, and the social environment on mating outcomes in stream water striders, Aquarius remigis, at two experimental sex ratios: equal and 2:1 male-biased. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify this full set of effects. We found that mating frequency (mating success) and mating exclusivity were positively correlated in the male-biased treatment, but were not related at equal sex ratios. At both sex ratios, males that were more active and aggressive had both higher mating frequency and higher mating exclusivity. A male's effective mating (the product of mating frequency and mating exclusivity) was also higher if on average he mated with females that tended to hide in refuges (and were presumably less available for future matings). Finally, males that were more often in pools with extremely aggressive ({''}hyperaggressive{'' males actually had increased mating exclusivity, potentially because hyperaggression reduced average female promiscuity. This study highlights the importance of considering mating outcomes beyond mating success and examining the simultaneous contribution of male behaviours, female behaviours and social factors to mating dynamics."

However, individuals often differ consistently from one another in how they cope with their environment, a phenomenon known as animal personality, which may affect how individuals use coordination rules and requiring them to compromise. Here we tracked the movements of pairs of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, separated by a transparent partition that allowed them to observe and interact with one another in a context containing cover. Individuals differed consistently in their tendency to approach their partner's compartment during collective movements. The strength of this social attraction was positively correlated with the behavioural coordination between members of a pair but was negatively correlated with an individual's tendency to lead. Social attraction may form part of a broader behavioural syndrome as it was predicted by the boldness of an individual, measured in isolation prior to the observation of pairs, and by the boldness of the partner. We found that bolder fish, and those paired with bolder partners, tended to approach their partner's compartment less closely. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and functioning of social groups and the emergence and maintenance of consistent behavioural differences.

Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals: tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results, such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality assays that test individuals alone."

Spanish flies showed greater heat resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the populations.

Class prediction and `leave-one-out' cross-validation analyses revealed that a bee's role as a scout in either context could be predicted with 92.5\% success using 89 genes at minimum. We also found that genes related to four neurotransmitter systems were part of a shared brain molecular signature in both types of scouts, and the two types of scouts were more similar for genes related to glutamate and GABA than catecholamine or acetylcholine signalling.

However, while the foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality. Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities."

Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level remains unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of consistent and repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species of shark, a taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet to be described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten independent shark groups across different habitats, testing repeatability in individual network position under changing environments. To understand better the mechanisms behind repeatable social behaviour, we also explored the coupling between individual preferences for specific group sizes and social network position. We quantify repeatability in sharks by demonstrating that despite changes in aggregation measured at the group level, the social network position of individuals is consistent across treatments. Group size preferences were found to influence the social network position of individuals in small groups but less so for larger groups suggesting network structure, and thus, repeatability was driven by social preference over aggregation tendency."

We measured a key trait of the visual system, the density of retinal cone photoreceptors, in a wild population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We tested whether individuals differed from each other in cone densities given within-individual variation across the retina and across eyes. We further tested whether the existing variation could lead to individual differences in two aspects of perception: visual resolution and chromatic contrast. We found consistent between-individual variation in the densities of all five types of avian cones, involved in chromatic and achromatic vision. Using perceptual modeling, we found that this degree of variation translated into significant between-individual differences in visual resolution and the chromatic contrast of a plumage signal that has been associated with mate choice and agonistic interactions. However, there was no evidence for a relationship between individual visual resolution and chromatic contrast. The implication is that some birds may have the sensory potential to perform ``better{''} in certain visual tasks, but not necessarily in both resolution and contrast simultaneously. Overall, our findings (a) highlight the need to consider multiple individuals when characterizing sensory traits of a species, and (b) provide some mechanistic basis for between-individual variation in different behaviors (i.e., animal personalities) and for testing the predictions of several widely accepted hypotheses (e.g., honest signaling)."

The boom in the literature on behavioural variability has led to the emergence of concepts such as behavioural plasticity, stereotypy, imprecision, and intra-individual variability (IIV). The proliferation of new terms has resulted in overlapping concepts, spreading confusion in understanding the origins of variability. Here we provide a critical overview of the concepts related to behavioural variability within the individual. We conclude that although there is no overlapping between behavioural plasticity and IIV, these concepts do overlap with stereotypy; they also face problems with ideas of abnormality and absence of function in stereotyped behaviour. We further provide a critical overview of the sometimes confusing relationship between (1) within individual variability, and (2) consistent variability across individuals (personality). We point out that personality is logically independent of both activational plasticity and IIV, because personality emerges at the population level, whereas plasticity and IIV emerge at the individual level. We conclude that, in personality studies, the failure to acknowledge the existence of either internal variability or consistent between-individual differences in internal variability will result in mixing different phenomena, and inhibit building unified accounts from heterogeneous databases.

Within-group variation in personality may facilitate the emergence of division of labour, if individuals with different personalities tend to specialize on different tasks. In turn, functional benefits derived from division of labour may promote the coexistence of alternative behavioural types. We investigated how intracolonial variation in personality influences individual and collective patterns of task performance in the social spider Anelosimus studiosus. Colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile females showed greater nonreproductive division of labour than monotypic colonies of either behavioural type. Within mixed-personality colonies, aggressive individuals tended to perform more prey capture, colony defence and/or web repair, while docile individuals became brood care specialists. Task differentiation was shaped by social dynamics, but behavioural plasticity varied with personality type: docile individuals were more socially responsive, shifting their task allocation in the presence of aggressive colonymates. Efficiency gains from personality-linked division of labour may help to explain the superior performance of diverse colonies and to maintain individual behavioural variation in A. studiosus and other social species.

Personality was assessed by quantifying individual responses to a novel object, and physiological stress was measured from faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Principal component and principal component regression analyses were performed to determine whether the behavioural and endocrine measures were related. Based on these analyses, shyness-boldness was found to best predict glucocorticoid levels, in that individuals expressing the greatest vigilance in response to the novel object also had the highest measured concentrations of faecal glucocorticoids. Exploration, however, was independent of measured glucocorticoid levels, consistent with a multidimensional interpretation of non-human animal personality."

Here, using house crickets (Acheta domesticus), we tested whether stereotypical approaches to quantifying repeatable variation in exploratory behavior measured the same behaviors. We found that house cricket exploratory behavior was highly repeatable in two populations (repeatability: 0.37-0.51). However, exploratory behavior across two different testing methods was not strongly correlated (r = -0.17 to 0.14). This suggests that either different behaviors or distinct components of exploratory behavior were being measured.

Such syndromes are often described by testing for variation in traits across commonly described dimensions (e. g. aggression and neophobia), independent of whether this variation is ecologically relevant to the focal species. Here, we use a variety of ecologically relevant behavioural traits to test for a colony-level behavioural syndrome in rock ants (Temnothorax rugatulus). Specifically, we combine field and laboratory assays to measure foraging effort, how colonies respond to different types of resources, activity level, response to threat and aggression level. We find evidence for a colony level syndrome that suggests colonies consistently differ in coping style-some are more risk-prone, whereas others are more risk-averse. Additionally, by collecting data across the North American range of this species, we show that environmental variation may affect how different populations maintain consistent variation in colony behaviour."

However, there has been little work assessing the influence of commonly-measured personality traits on fitness, which is pertinent when the genetic basis of personality is considered. We measured whether the reproductive behaviour and success of zebra finches in a captive mixed-sex aviary environment was influenced by an aspect of their personality, their exploratory behaviour in a single-sex social aviary. We found that more exploratory males made a greater number of breeding attempts and raised more nestlings than less exploratory males. These results were not confounded by extra-pair paternity, which was not related to personality, or by the individuals that did not initiate any reproductive attempts at all. Our work provides evidence that attributes of personality may influence the degree to which individuals cope with, and thrive in a captive environment and this should be accounted for in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Furthermore, this suggests that there may be selection on these traits as part of the domestication process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, little is known about how boldness is linked with the ability to win fights (resource holding potential) or about how the experience of fighting may alter subsequent boldness. Animal contests often involve role asymmetries, where the 2 opponents fight in different ways. Here, we investigate boldness before and after fighting in attacking and defending hermit crabs during contests over the ownership of gastropod shells. Although prefight boldness did not influence the chance of winning for attackers, successful defenders had longer startle responses (less bold) than those that gave up. Postfight changes in boldness also differed between roles. For defenders, there was a significant decline in consistency of startle responses after fighting, coupled with outcome-dependent plasticity in mean boldness. Furthermore, postfight boldness in defenders varied with the intensity of agonistic behavior inflicted on them by attackers. In contrast, boldness in attackers was stable across the before-and after-fighting situations. Links between internal state and agonistic behavior are known to vary between roles in asymmetric contests. It now appears that similar role-specific links are present between aggression and animal personality."

Such traits are, therefore, predicted to exhibit high repeatability. However, studies have shown that courtship behaviors vary greatly in their within-individual repeatability, resulting in substantial variation in their ability to reflect male quality. This has implications for the evolution of female mate choice and courtship communication, as low levels of repeatability may reflect courtship signals that do not provide accurate quality information to females. In this article, we tested whether male courtship shuddering in the tropical orb-web spider, Argiope radon, influences female mate choice. We also tested whether male shudder performance reflects male phenotypic condition and is repeatable. We found that male shudder performance and condition predicted female latency to move onto the mating thread, a measure of mate preference. Aspects of male shudder performance were positively correlated with male body condition. Further, we found surprisingly high levels of repeatability in male courtship shuddering, ranking among the highest levels recorded to date for courtship behavior. We suggest that male courtship shuddering functions as an important indicator of male quality, with strong potential to respond to selection."

Males that had a consistently more active-aggressive behavioural type had, on average, higher mating success largely because they spent more time active in microhabitats associated with acquiring mates. Some active-aggressive males, however, showed hyperaggressive behaviour, apparently attempting to mate forcibly with other males, or forcibly separate pairs, which was rarely successful. A higher tendency to be hyperaggressive was associated with reduced mating success (i.e. being hyperaggressive represents low social skill). The overall effect was thus stabilizing sexual selection on male activity and aggression. The social environment also had large effects on male behaviour and mating success. In particular, the presence of a keystone hyperaggressive male had strong negative effects on the mating success and general activity of other males in the pool. Notably, males with a more active-aggressive behavioural type maintained higher mating success than less active-aggressive males in the presence of a hyperaggressive male. Social plasticity (change in behaviour in response to changing social conditions) also depended on the male's behavioural type; males with a more active-aggressive behavioural type were more plastic.

Animals of temperate environments have evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality: suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality, whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction, individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over the bold-shy axis."

Furthermore, factors of the social environment may safeguard individuals from environmental stressors. In the study reported here, we tested the effects of moving into a new habitat on the mean, variance, and repeatability of individual behavioral tendencies between two social contexts (isolated vs. in a social group). Using the arid social spider, Stegodyphus dumicola (Araneae: Eresidae), we tested whether individuals' boldness was influenced by either (i) their time spent in a social group or (ii) their latency since having moved into a new habitat. We found that the effect of moving into a new habitat on individuals' boldness depended on whether spiders entered the novel environment in isolation or as part of a social group. Spiders that experienced a habitat shift with a social group showed no change in their average boldness, whereas individuals that shifted environments in isolation showed an increase in their mean boldness. Interestingly, neither of these trends was influenced by the time which had elapsed since the habitat shift, suggesting that shifting habitats has a lasting effect on isolated spiders' behavioral tendencies. Finally, we assessed how time spent in a new environment influenced colonies' collective foraging behavior. Here, we found that the longer social groups remained in a new environment, the faster the group responded to prey. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the effects of shifting physical environments on individuals' boldness may depend on individuals' social context, and that group tenure is associated with subtle shifts in colonies' collective foraging behavior."

A range of factors such as sex, age, body size and prior experiences has to varying degrees been observed to affect the social status an individual obtains. Recent work on animal personality (i.e. consistent variation in behavioural responses of individuals) demonstrates that personality can co-vary with social status, suggesting that also behavioural variation can play an important role in establishment of status. We investigated whether personality could predict the outcome of duels between pairs of morphologically matched male domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a species where individuals readily form social hierarchies. We found that males that more quickly explored a novel arena, or remained vigilant for a longer period following the playback of a warning call were more likely to obtain a dominant position. These traits were uncorrelated to each other and were also uncorrelated to aggression during the initial part of the dominance-determining duel. Our results indicate that several behavioural traits independently play a role in the establishment of social status, which in turn can have implications for the reproductive success of different personality types."

To estimate male quality, females can use multiple traits. Among those, recent studies have shown that male personality traits could play an important role in mate choice as they are often linked to major life-history traits and can be heritable. However, because the relationships between life-history traits and personality traits are context dependent, females are expected to choose male personality types according to the mating context. In this study on common lizards (Zootoca vivipara), we examined the role of personality traits in female mate choice and mating behavior after experimentally manipulating the predation risk experienced by females prior to mating. We showed that females not exposed to predator cues preferred males with high-activity level, a heritable behavior. When females are exposed to predator cues prior to mating, this preference was reversed. High-activity levels generally increase competitive abilities and survival but could be detrimental when predators are present. Our results suggest that female common lizards choose males based on their personality types and can modify their preferences according to their environmental context in order to produce offspring that are better adapted to their environment."

It is poorly known whether this covariance occurs on the between-individual level and what its selective consequences are. We used repeated measures (N = 562 observation events) of individual tawny owl Strix aluco females (N = 237) to study the integrated effects of seasonal timing of reproduction and clutch size on boldness displayed during defense of their clutch, in relation to plumage coloration, including local recruit production as a selective force on these traits. Using a Bayesian multivariate mixed model, we quantified the covariances between these traits on phenotypic, residual, and between-individual level and used a structural equation modeling approach to test the significance of presumed causal relationship between these traits in an a priori hypothesized path. On the phenotypic level, boldness was determined through early timing of breeding and larger clutch size, and early breeding increased recruitment probability. However, this relationship was entirely due to residual covariances and was not present on the between-individual level. The low individual-level correlations did not constrain the capacity of the population to respond to evolution as quantified by average autonomy (a metric summarizing evolutionary constraint on multiple traits). In the tawny owl, the association between early breeding and bold behavior, which is favored by selection, is solely due to extrinsic, nonheritable factors.

Using surveys completed by dog owners, data was gathered on the behaviour of the dogs, in addition to the physical characteristics and management characteristics of the dogs (n = 1978). Twelve personality traits were identified and investigated for associations with the demographic data. It was found that the working status of the dog was more commonly associated with differences in personality than other analyzed factors. Gundogs had higher scores for `fetching tendency' and `trainability' than Showdogs or Pets (P < 0.05). Chocolate dogs were more `agitated when ignored' and showed more `excitability' than black dogs, and lower `trainability' and `noise fear' than both yellow and black dogs (all P < 0.05). Dogs exercised for longer periods showed less aggression, less fear of humans and objects and lower separation anxiety than dogs that were not as active.

Nevertheless, personality traits have long been determined while ignoring the social context, especially in lower vertebrates such as fish. In the present experiment, we hypothesize that group connections (network density) may be positively correlated to consistency of aggressiveness by avoiding over-aggressive acts in further encounters. To test this hypothesis, we used eels (Anguilla anguilla) as a model species and monitored both aggressiveness and sociability in 64 individuals over their first 7 months of growth from the glass eel stage. As expected, social fish were less aggressive than their non-social counterparts at all times, highlighting the existence of a behavioural syndrome in eels. Additionally, rank-order consistency of aggressiveness was higher in groups of fish with high social connectivity, compared to those in less-connected fish groups. While aggressiveness must be consistent to be considered a personality trait, our results suggest that both aggressiveness and its consistency are influenced by initial social context."

The first two lines of defence, aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency to these responses did not correlate with any of the female defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately, this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence behaviour against adult brood parasites in general.

Personality traits and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals' consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however, this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the alternative compensation model.

Under conditions of high or frequent predation risk, such trade-offs may lead to reduced fitness. Here, we test the prediction that prey reduce the costs associated with lost opportunities following acute predation threats by exhibiting short-term compensatory foraging responses. Under semi-natural conditions, we exposed female guppies Poecilia reticulate from high and low predation risk sites to one of three levels of acute predation threat (high, intermediate or low concentrations of conspecific alarm cues). Our results confirm previous reports, demonstrating that guppies from a high predation site were consistently `bolder' (shorter escape latencies) and exhibited graded threat-sensitive responses to different simulated threat levels while those from the low predation site were `shyer' and exhibited non-graded responses. Most importantly, we found that when guppies from low predation sites resumed foraging, they did so at rates significantly lower than baseline rates. However, guppies from high predation sites resumed foraging either at rates equal to baseline (in response to low or intermediate risk stimuli) or significantly increased relative to baseline rates (in response to high risk stimuli).

The main aim of this work was to dilucidate if boldness was related to the development of the secondary sexual traits (SSTs) in the male of the river blenny Salaria fluviatilis, a freshwater fish which takes care of eggs. As a second objective SSTs effect on parental status adoption was also be explored. Wild young fish were caught in the Segre River (Ebro basin) in November 2010. Fish were kept in five aquaria in groups of eight males and eight females with artificial nests. Boldness (boldness score and hesitancy) of males (initially with little SSTs development) was tested as the time required to exit a refuge when exposed to a new environment. Fish were mantained in the same aquaria for several months, and males' SSTs development and reproductive behaviour were monitored. Boldness score was negatively associated to cephalic crest development. Hesitancy was negatively related to male length and was also influenced by the interaction between male length and cephalic crest. Parental status acquisition was positively related to the male's length, marginally related to anal gland development, and non-related to cephalic crest. These results suggest an intrasexual role of the crest as an informative trait of boldness (honest signal) which might not necessarily be chosen by the females. It is also discussed that correlational selection could be responsible for linking boldness and growth rate in this species. Sexual selection, in addition to having directed the evolution of secondary sexual traits, might have favored certain personality traits (e.g. boldness) associated with the achievement of a larger body length."

Consistent individual differences in behavior have been found across taxa, and have been shown to influence a range of ecological processes. The role of personalities in sexual selection has been considered, and examples exist that show selection for personality traits with both assortative and disassortative mating patterns between personality types. One overlooked aspect of the personality and sexual selection literature is the potential for personality-signaling interactions, specifically with complex signaling. Complex signaling is a diverse topic in itself, and in short, consists of multiple signals within one or more modalities that interact to elicit a receiver response. Research into complex signaling has been thorough, although at times studies discover complex signaling systems that fail to fit into one of the existing hypotheses in the literature. Here, we argue that personalities may interact with complex signaling, which should be considered by researchers of both personality and sexual selection and communication. We describe several ways in which personality-complex signaling interactions could affect both the signaler and receiver, and the way in which they may drive personality-specific signals as well as receiver preferences. Finally, we discuss how considering personality in complex signaling studies may inform theory as well as improve the ability of researchers to accurately describe its function."

In particular, ecologists and evolutionary biologists alike seek to explore the functional consequences of individuals' personalities and explanations for their general maintenance. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings to personality is arguably key to a deeper understanding of their functional consequences and maintenance. In particular, consistent individual differences in metabolic rate have been proposed as a general explanation for the maintenance of consistent individual differences in boldness, aggressiveness, and activity level. In this paper we explore whether consistent individual differences in boldness are associated with heat rate, a proxy for metabolic rate, in two species of orb-weaving spider: Larinioides cornutus and L. patagiatus. We first documented consistent individual differences in boldness in L. cornutus but not L. patagiatus, as estimated by individuals' latency to resume movement following an aversive stimulus. We also measured individuals' heart rate twice in a separate situation. We then tested for an association between individuals' boldness and their heart rate during these two events. We found that increased boldness was associated with increased heart. Thus, individuals that resumed movement quickly following an aversive stimulus also exhibited faster heart rates. Our studies provide further evidence that consistent individual differences in key physiological attributes, like metabolic rate, might be a general mechanism underlying consistent individual differences in behavior."

Freshwater ecosystems provide a unique opportunity to investigate this issue, notably because the ecological impacts of non-native species have been extensively documented and because animal personality has been widely studied using freshwater model species. Here, we aim at developing some perspectives on the potential effects of animal personality on the ecological impacts of freshwater non-native species across levels of biological organizations. At the individual level, personality types have been demonstrated to affect the physiology, metabolism, life history traits and fitness of individuals. We used these effects to discuss how they could subsequently impact invaded populations and, in turn, recipient communities.

Behavioral tests, often observed by independent experts, can provide objective data, but capture only a short behavioral sequence in a defined situation and are practical only for small study cohorts. Questionnaires can be targeted to much larger populations and provide long-term perspectives on behaviors, including potential correlated environmental factors. However, questionnaires are sensitive for misinterpretations and the subjectivity of the participant may affect the outcome. Therefore, particular attention has to be paid to structure and form of the questions to ensure that the questionnaire measures what it is supposed to measure. We have initiated a program on genetic studies in canine anxiety and have developed a questionnaire for behavioral phenotyping. The aim of the questionnaire is to identify the most fearful dogs (cases) and dogs not showing fear (controls) within and across breeds for gene mapping purposes. Knowing the challenges in the phenotyping of complex neurobehavioral traits, the aim of this study was to assess the external and convergent validity and re-test reliability of the developed questionnaire. External validity was assessed by comparing questionnaire data against short behavioral test of selected dogs (N=54), and convergent validity was estimated using ``known group comparisons{''}, i.e. whether the dogs with separation anxiety have also more noise phobia. Re-test reliability was evaluated from the subsample (N=36) of the owners who filled the questionnaire twice within an 8-month period. We found an excellent correlation between questionnaire data and the behavioral test, and the most important questions on the fearful reactions toward strangers, had the highest correlation with the behavioral test in which the dog met a stranger (mean r(s) = 0.63). Convergent validity was also well demonstrated by showing that a known co-morbid anxiety trait, separation anxiety, was more common in noise sensitive dogs as expected (Wilcoxon rank-sum test chi(2)(1.1732) = 9.8, p < 0.01). Similarly, the test-retest reliability was good (mean values: 0.69 Spearman correlation; 0.59 Kappa value). Most importantly, the questions asking the frequency of fear reactions had excellent repeatability (mean frequency of fear reactions toward humans, dogs and situations 0.78 Spearman correlation, toward thunder, gunshot, fireworks, 0.76 Spearman correlation). These results encourage a conclusion that our questionnaire may serve as a reliable phenotyping tool for fearfulness in dogs, which, in turn, should help us to establish sufficiently large study cohorts for successful genetic analyses.

Fish were submitted to a risk-taking test twice to determine the consistency of behavioral responses. Afterwards fish were transferred to individual confinement chambers where their swimming activity and oxygen consumption were measured. Latency to take risks was negatively correlated to both movement and oxygen consumption rates, indicating that risk-avoiders (long latency) were less active and, hence, did not consume so much oxygen as risk-takers. In conclusion, this work reports the first data on the links between risk-taking and the behavioral responses and oxygen consumption during a confinement stress in fish. The relationships between behavioral and physiological variables are significant, suggesting the existence of divergent coping styles in gilthead seabream. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To estimate the evolvability and adaptability of individually consistent behavioral variation, there is a crucial need to quantify the genetics underlying personality. Here, we experimentally studied the repeatability of various individual behaviors and then estimated heritability of formed boldness, exploration, and aggression components in juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta in standardized laboratory environment. Principal component analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096). These results suggest that additive genetic variation underlies phenotypically consistent behavioral patterns, proposing that any selection acting on behavior, stress tolerance, or correlated traits has a potential to induce evolution in fish personality."

Variation in the size of metabolic organs has recently been suggested to cause and maintain variation in personality. Here, we examine two main underlying notions: (i) that organ sizes vary consistently between individuals and cause consistent behavioural patterns, and (ii) that a more exploratory personality is associated with reduced survival. Exploratory behaviour of captive red knots (Calidris canutus, a migrant shorebird) was negatively rather than positively correlated with digestive organ (gizzard) mass, as well as with body mass. In an experiment, we reciprocally reduced and increased individual gizzard masses and found that exploration scores were unaffected. Whether or not these birds were resighted locally over the 19 months after release was negatively correlated with their exploration scores. Moreover, a long-term mark-recapture effort on free-living red knots with known gizzard masses at capture confirmed that local resighting probability (an inverse measure of exploratory behaviour) was correlated with gizzard mass without detrimental effects on survival. We conclude that personality drives physiological adjustments, rather than the other way around, and suggest that physiological adjustments mitigate the survival costs of exploratory behaviour. Our results show that we need to reconsider hypotheses explaining personality variation based on organ sizes and differential survival."

We used the Eastern water skink (Eulamprus quoyii) to examine associations between exploration, boldness and individual variability in spatial learning, a dimension of lizard cognition with important bearing on fitness. We show that males perform better than females in a biologically relevant spatial learning task. This is the first evidence for sex differences in learning in a reptile, and we argue that it is probably owing to sex-specific selective pressures that may be widespread in lizards. Across the sexes, we found a clear association between boldness after a simulated predatory attack and the probability of learning the spatial task. In contrast to previous studies, we found a nonlinear association between boldness and learning: both `bold' and `shy' behavioural types were more successful learners than intermediate males. Our results do not fit with recent predictions suggesting that individual differences in learning may be linked with behavioural types via high-low-risk/reward trade-offs. We suggest the possibility that differences in spatial cognitive performance may arise in lizards as a consequence of the distinct environmental variability and complexity experienced by individuals as a result of their sex and social tactics."

Such lack of invertebrate studies might be due to a traditional belief that invertebrates are just `minirobots'. Lately, studies highlighting personality differences in a range of invertebrate species have challenged this idea. However, the number of invertebrate species investigated still contrasts markedly with the effort that has been made studying vertebrates, which represent only a single subphylum. We describe how investigating proximate, evolutionary and ecological correlates of personality variation in invertebrates may broaden our understanding of personality variation in general. In our opinion, personality studies on invertebrates are much needed, because invertebrates exhibit a range of aspects in their life histories, social and sexual behaviours that are extremely rare or absent in most studied vertebrates, but that offer new avenues for personality research. Examples are complete metamorphosis, male emasculation during copulation, asexual reproduction, eusociality and parasitism. Further invertebrate personality studies could enable a comparative approach to unravel how past selective forces have driven the evolution of personality differences. Finally, we point out the advantages of studying personality variation in many invertebrate species, such as easier access to relevant data on proximate and ultimate factors, arising from easy maintenance, fast life cycles and short generation times.

And yet, efficient detection of personality differences early in development could be useful in selecting individuals for various management purposes. In a first step towards addressing this, we report results of a study of individual differences in general motor activity among littermates of the domestic cat, obtained using an observational method designed to overcome the difficulties of evaluating the behaviour of newborn altricial young. Three litters (14 kittens) were filmed in the absence of the mother at regular intervals across the 1st postnatal (pre-weaning) month. Six untrained observers independently viewed 10 videos for each litter and ranked the kittens in each video from the least to the most active. Significant differences were found between at least some kittens in all three litters (Friedman tests: F-r=16.3, 25.8, 11.3; P<0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0085, respectively), and there was significant agreement on kitten ranks among the six observers (Kendall coefficients of concordance: W=0.84, 0.84, 0.55; P<0.01 for the three litters, respectively). There was also significant agreement between the results of two observers using the ranking method and a quantitative method of behavioural assessment (Spearman rank order correlation: r(s)=0.93, P=0.001). We conclude that stable individual differences in general motor activity, possibly indicating differences in temperament, are present in kittens early in development, and that ranking the degree of such behaviour in a naturalistic setting provides a valid and efficient method of detecting such differences. It is now necessary to investigate if such early differences are predictive of later behavioural phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We tested whether the individual differences in foraging behavior were associated with baseline concentrations and responses of cortisol, a steroid hormone linked to personality differences in a variety of animals including fishes. We quantified the proportion of time spent on moving by focal charr in the field and then capturing them. Captured individuals were either (i) sacrificed immediately to quantify baseline cortisol concentrations, (ii) held in an unfamiliar field environment for 15 min and then sacrificed to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to handling and holding in a novel field environment, or (iii) held in an unfamiliar field environment with a white Plexiglas base (stressor) for 15 min to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to a novel object. Eleven statistical models relating cortisol concentrations to the proportion of time individuals spent on moving while searching for prey were compared using multi-model inferencing. Cortisol concentrations were higher for charr that spent a lower proportion of time on moving in the field than for charr that spent a higher proportion of time on moving. For a given proportion of time spent on moving, mean cortisol concentrations between baseline and experimental treatments, our measure of cortisol response, did not differ markedly.

Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study, overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g. lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and, at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual performance change significantly between data sets."

In this study, we explore how individual differences in behavior and body size determine task allocation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We found that individuals with high body condition indices were less likely to participate in prey capture, and individuals' tendency to engage in prey capture was not associated with either their behavioral traits or body size. No traits were associated with individuals' propensity to participation in web repair, but small individuals were more likely to engage in standard web-building. We also discovered consistent, differences among colonies in their collective behavior (i.e., colony-level personality). At the colony level, within-colony variation in behavior (aggressiveness) and body size were positively associated with aggressive foraging behavior. Together, our findings reveal a subtly complex relationship between individual variation and collective behavior in this species. We close by comparing the relationship between individual variation and social organization in nine species of social spider.

The lack of evidence for visual self-recognition in fish supports this method. However, recent work points towards different hormonal and gene expression responses when fish are exposed either to conspecific opponents or to their mirror image, urging for validation of this widespread method. Here, we test the predictive value of mirror tests in three sympatric cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika: the cooperative breeder Neolamprologus pulcher, the polygamous shell brooder Telmatochromis vittatus and the monogamous, biparental piscivore Lepidiolamprologus elongatus. In particular, we compare differences in restrained and overt aggression levels for individuals of each species when confronted with a mirror or a live conspecific. The three species differed in response to the two contest situations. While in N. pulcher both aggressive responses were correlated between the mirror test and the live opponent fight, there was no such relationship in T. vittatus and L. elongatus. Thus, the mirror test appears to be a suitable surrogate for intraspecific aggression in N. pulcher, while aggression against a mirror image has limited predictive value for intraspecific aggression in the other two species. These results underline the importance of validating the mirror test's predictive value in a study species before drawing conclusions from mirror tests about aggressiveness under natural, social conditions."

In this field study, we investigated associations between neophobia (latency to enter nest in the presence of a novel object), nest defence (response to a model predator) and breathing rate in response to handling in breeding pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). We did not find any significant difference in antipredator responses between males and females, which indicates low sexual conflict over parental care in the pied flycatcher. However, females were more neophobic than males, while males and females did not differ in their breathing rates. Further, our study demonstrated a strong positive correlation between nest defence behaviour and neophobia in male, but not in female pied flycatchers. Males that defended their nest more had lower breathing rate and higher latency to resume nestling feeding after encountering a predator decoy than males that mobbed less intensely.

We propose that regulatory focus theory (RFT) could serve as one such framework while also providing insights into how animal personality relates to welfare. RFT distinguishes between two types of approach motivation: promotion, the motivation to approach gains, and prevention, the motivation to approach or maintain safety. Decades of research have established the utility of RFT as a model of human behavior and recent evidence from zoo- housed primates and laboratory rats has suggested that it may be applicable to nonhuman animal behavior as well. Building on these initial studies, we collected data on 60 rats, Rattus norvegicus, navigating an automated maze that allowed individuals to maintain darkness (indicative of prevention/ safety-approach motivation) and/ or activate food rewards (indicative of promotion/ gain-approach motivation). As predicted, both behaviors showed stable individual differences (Ps < 0.01)and were inversely associated with physiological signs of chronic stress, possibly indicating poor welfare (Ps < 0.05). Subsequently, half the rats were exposed to a manageable threat (noxious novel object) in the homecage. Re-testing in the maze revealed that threat exposure increased darkness time achieved (P, 0.05), suggesting a mechanism by which prevention motivation may be enhanced. These results point toward the potential utility of RFT as a model for animal behavior and welfare."

Reconciliation, or postconflict affiliation between former opponents, is a behavioural domain in which individual differences have not been systematically studied. Using a long-term data set comprising over 2000 conflict and postconflict observations in two groups of outdoor-housed chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we provide evidence for stable individual variation in reconciliation and test several hypotheses on how this postconflict mechanism relates to social switching behaviour. Results of generalized multilevel models revealed that individual differences remained a substantial source of variation in reconciliation after controlling for a number of situational variables (e. g. the nature of the relationship between opponents) shown by previous research to influence its occurrence. We further demonstrated a positive association between an individual's conciliatory tendency and three separate indices of social switching behaviour, proposing that individual differences in reconciliation may reflect a more fundamental motivation to switch between different social states. In addition to a discussion of potential motivational underpinnings, we provide an impetus for future work to consider how reconciliation relates to the broader constructs and themes identified within animal personality research. To the extent that individual differences in other aspects of conflict and postconflict repertoires exhibit temporal and cross-situational consistency, they too should inform our understanding of animal personalities. Delineating how these and other dimensions of sociality are in part driven by stable individual variation not only has implications for how social interactions themselves unfold, but ultimately for the fitness of the individuals therein.

A link between personality and social skills seems obvious from a human perspective and it is therefore surprising that relatively few studies have looked at the effect of animal personality on communicative interactions. In this study we tested the evidence for personality-related variation in birds during vocal interactions in the field. We scored individual variation in exploratory behaviour of great tits, Parus major, in repeated trials of a novel environment test in the laboratory and related this score to approach and vocal behaviour in response to playback of conspecific songs in the field. Contrary to our expectation, we found males with low exploration scores approached the speaker more closely than birds with high exploration scores. Birds with high exploration scores seemed to respond less aggressively while dealing with the simulated intruder vocally by switching song types more often. Our results suggest that slow-exploring birds in the laboratory respond more strongly during natural interactions in the field. An independent and very similar study also revealed a correlation between personality score and playback response, but with a seemingly contrasting outcome. A comparison of the two studies provides insights into the complexity of interpreting playback results and territorial response patterns in general.

Animals often modify their behaviours according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also retain consistent individual differences across environmental change (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour.

One reason for the lack of experimental studies on personality development may be that trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of the definition of animal personality, whereas, also by definition, ontogeny deals with change over time. Single traits or correlations between traits may be consistent or inconsistent throughout ontogeny; however, the proximate and ultimate causes are not well understood. Environmental factors acting upon individuals during early ontogeny potentially influence personality development substantially. Early environments may severely constrain but also adaptively shape individuals. We examined the personality development of cavies, Cavia aperea, when exposed to increasing and decreasing photoperiod before and after birth. We determined how these predictive environmental cues influenced the development of three behavioural and two physiological traits, their temporal consistency and the correlations between them. We found remarkable plasticity in the development of personality in the cavy, despite a relatively high degree of temporal consistency in most traits. There were stable correlations, some of which became tighter over time, between basal cortisol levels, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness across two different ontogenetic stages. However, we also found that some correlations emerged only after maturation or disappeared over time. Whereas exploration behaviour was tightly correlated with basal cortisol and boldness was correlated with resting metabolic rate, both correlations disappeared in mature animals. Instead, a correlation between exploration and boldness was evident in mature animals. These results call for a broader incorporation of developmental aspects into personality research.

Average autonomy quantifies the extent in which estimated genetic (co)variances constrain the rate of evolutionary change of behavioral traits forming a syndrome when these traits are under selections in all possible directions of multivariate trait-space. However, it is not clear whether a calculated average autonomy value of an observed syndrome constitutes a significant evolutionary constraint or not. I here outline an approach for testing evolutionary constraint in a syndrome, which is based on comparing the observed genetic (co)variance structure to the one where the genetic covariances are assumed to be zero and taking onboard the uncertainty in the (co)variances between behaviors into the calculations of average autonomy. The approach can be implemented in the context of parametric bootstrap or Bayesian statistics, and I provide a worked example of the latter. I further highlight that when genetic (co)variances are unattainable, the between-individual (co)variances act as an interesting proxy, which is within reach for many behavioral studies. I provide R code for all calculations."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether breeding state males of the two-spotted goby, Gobiusculus flavescens, showed consistent degree of boldness when tested in four different behaviour assays. We also wanted to investigate whether boldness varied over the breeding season in accordance with changes in male-male competition for matings. We used two standard assays (the emergence test and the open field test), and two simple assays related to threat response. Repeated runs of each of the tests were highly correlated, and we found significant correlations between all four assays. Thus, we have documented both a within and a between-context consistency in risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we found that goby males studied during the middle of the breeding season were bolder than males studied at the end of the season. Since male two-spotted gobies face strongly decreasing male-male competition as the season progresses, the benefit of being bold for the mating success of the males may differ over the time of the breeding season. The difference in behaviour found over the season thus corresponds well with the sexual dynamics of this model species."

Our findings imply that the 2 sexes differentially value themselves versus their young possibly because of the different reproductive roles they have.The direction of covariation in behavioral traits (a behavioral syndrome) is typically the same in males and females, although intersexual differences in life history could lead to intersexual heterogeneity in syndrome structure. We explored whether a behavioral syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during 2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1) hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38\% repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation. Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this heterogeneity."

Our work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into higher order phenomena such as clade diversification.Many animals exhibit personality types, for example, with some individuals being consistently both more aggressive and more willing to explore novel situations than others. Often those behavioral syndromes are shaped by pleiotropic genetic and physiological mechanisms or joint selective pressures that constrain variation within and between 2 seemingly different types of behavior. Here, we used wild zebrafish to ask whether the behavioral syndromes typically measured within populations also occur across populations, as might be expected for syndromes created by forces such as a hormone with multiple effects. We found major differences across populations in both aggression and boldness. Zebrafish captured in the wild from running streams in Northern India were both bold and aggressive, approaching predators and conspecifics more frequently than did zebrafish from slower moving irrigation canals or a large, still, lake near Kolkata, India. We did not find any sites that were bold, but not aggressive, or aggressive, but not bold, suggesting that these behavioral combinations are not physiologically possible or that they are eliminated by population-level selection. Within populations, however, we found evidence for an aggression-boldness syndrome within only 1 of 5 measured populations (from an irrigation canal). Zebrafish also became markedly more aggressive after 3 months in a laboratory environment. These results offer a natural example of population-level personality types in wild organisms and show that population-level patterns and environmental plasticity may be as important as within-population constraints. Our work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into higher order phenomena such as clade diversification and selection."

Although variation in experience is an obvious potential driver of intraspecific behavioral variation, predicting the impact of experience on suites of correlated behavioral traits is less intuitive. Specifically, if experience impacts traits that shape individuals' success in multiple contexts (e. g., foraging and anti-predator behavior), then experience could generate cross-contextual performance trade-offs associated with behavioral spillover. In the present study, we explore how sublethal experience with predators impacts various aspects of male behavioral tendencies in the Madagascar hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa. First, we found that males' activity level and boldness were correlated together in the form of a behavioral syndrome. Second, we found that repeated sublethal interactions with predators shifted male boldness but not activity level, thus suggesting that the syndrome's constituent traits can respond to experience at least semi-independently. Third, we discovered that although predator exposure only influenced boldness, we found that boldness was highly correlated with males' ability to obtain rewarding positions in the harems of rival males. Taken together, our data suggest (but do not yet confirm) that although sublethal exposure to predators influences only a narrow subset of male's behavioral tendencies, these effects could still have nonintuitive consequences for males' success in functionally dissimilar ecological contexts (i.e., social and sexual encounters)."

We surveyed individual refuge use of mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat, and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size, crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be more repeatable over time."

However, evidence for this link remains limited. Pre-mating sexual cannibalism can be a behavioural syndrome (i.e. a suboptimal personality) in which adaptive female aggression towards heterospecific prey spills over on non-adaptive aggression towards courting males, independently of the female mating or feeding status (i.e. the aggressive spillover hypothesis', ASH). On the other hand, sexual cannibalism can also be a form of mate choice by which females selectively kill or mate with males depending on the male phenotype. We introduce the hypothesis that the most aggressive females in the population will not only attack males more frequently, but will be less likely to impose sexual selection on males through sexual cannibalism. Assuming that in a field common garden experiment in which females were fed ad libitum the rate of weight gain by a female may reflect her voracity or aggressiveness, we show that in the cannibalistic burrowing wolf spider Lycosa hispanica (formerly L.tarantula), voracity towards heterospecific prey predicts a female's tendency towards sexual cannibalism. Unmated females with higher weight gains were more cannibalistic and attacked males regardless of the male phenotype. On the other hand, females that were less voracious tended to be less cannibalistic, and when they did kill a male, they were selective, killing males in poorer condition and mating with those in better condition. Our results demonstrate that females with different phenotypes (growth rates) differently imposed selection on male condition, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that female aggression levels can spill over on sexual selection through sexual cannibalism."

Many studies report considerable interindividual variation in the degree to which inducible defences are expressed, yet what underlies this variation is poorly understood. Here, we show that individuals differing in a key personality trait also differ in the magnitude of morphological defence expression. Crucian carp showing risky behaviours (bold individuals) expressed a significantly greater morphological defence response when exposed to a natural enemy when compared with shy individuals. Furthermore, we show that fish of different personality types differ in their behavioural plasticity, with shy fish exhibiting greater absolute plasticity than bold fish. Our data suggest that individuals with bold personalities may be able to compensate for their risk-prone behavioural type by expressing enhanced morphological defences."

Moreover, territorial aggression is particularly important in the context of interspecific competition. Tree swallows and eastern bluebirds are highly aggressive, secondary cavity-nesting birds that compete for limited nesting sites. We studied eastern bluebirds at a field site in the southern Appalachian Mountains that has been recently colonized (<40 yr) by tree swallows undergoing a natural range expansion. The field site is composed of distinct areas where bluebirds compete regularly with tree swallows and areas where there is little interaction between the two species. Once birds had settled, we measured how interspecific competition affects the relationship between assortative mating (paired individuals that behave similarly) and reproductive success in eastern bluebirds. We found a strong tendency toward assortative mating throughout the field site. In areas of high interspecific competition, pairs that behaved the most similarly and displayed either extremely aggressive or extremely non-aggressive phenotypes experienced higher reproductive success. Our data suggest that interspecific competition with tree swallows may select for bluebirds that express similar behavior to that of their mate. Furthermore, animal personality may be an important factor influencing the outcome of interactions between native and aggressive, invasive species."

We infected Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) with the brain-encysted trematode parasite, Diplostomum phoxini, and studied whether infection could modify the personality of their hosts. Our results show that D. phoxini infection did not affect the mean levels of boldness, activity or exploration, but infected minnows showed higher repeatability in boldness and activity, and reduced repeatability in exploration. We also found that D. phoxini may be able to break the associations (behavioral syndromes) between behavioral traits, but that this effect may be dependent on parasite intensity. Furthermore, the effect of D. phoxini infection on personality of the hosts was found to be nonlinearly dependent on infection intensity. Taken together, our results suggest that D. phoxini parasites may shape the personality of their hosts, but that behavioral consequences of ecologically relevant infection levels may be rather subtle and easily remain undetected if only the mean trait expressions are compared."

To be able to understand how an individual's behavioural, physiological and life history traits may coevolve, we need to jointly quantify these traits in order to study their covariance. Few studies have established links between personality and immunity properties of an individual. We here examined covariation of a measure of skeletal size (tarsus length), three behavioural traits (activity, handling aggression and breath rate) and two immunological traits (IgG level and haematocrit), in 592 wild caught blue tits. Many individuals (201) were tested more than once, allowing quantification of individual consistency of all traits and partition of the covariances between the traits, using a multivariate mixed model, into between individual and residual covariances. We find individual consistency of all behavioural traits, indicating that these capture aspects of blue tit adult personality and also the physiological measures are repeatable. Contrary to the POLS expectation, we find no overall significant individual level correlation structure between these traits and a factor analytical approach confirmed that between individual correlations across traits were not due to a common (POLS) factor or driven by size (tarsus length). Based on a published power study, we conclude that there is no common syndrome of individual level covariance between personality and physiological traits in wild blue tits or that the effect sizes, such a syndrome generates, are too low (r < 0.3) to detect. Future field-based work should be designed to explore low effect sizes and strive to measure specific traits whose involvement is implicated to have large effect sizes as based on, e.g. laboratory findings."

In this study, we investigate the behavioral mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of individual workers and its physiological underpinning in the ant Myrmica rubra. By investigating worker personalities we uncover position-associated behavioral syndromes. This context-independent and temporally stable set of correlated behaviors (positive association between movements and attraction towards light) could promote the basic separation between inside (brood tenders) and outside workers (foragers). These position-associated behavior syndromes are coupled with a high probability to perform tasks, located at the defined position, and a characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon profile. We discuss the potentially physiological causes for the observed behavioral syndromes and highlight how the study of animal personalities can provide new insights for the study of division of labor and self-organized processes in general."

At the same time, research on honest signalling of aggression has revealed that while some of the putative aggression signals are reliable, they are only imperfectly so. This study asks whether a significant portion of the variance in the aggression-signal regression may be explained by individual differences in signalling strategies. Using the well-studied aggressive signalling system of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), we carried out repeated assays to measure both aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling of territorial males. Through these assays, we found that aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling were both highly repeatable, and moreover that aggressive behaviours in 2009-2010 predicted whether the birds would attack a taxidermic mount over a year later. Most significantly, we found that residual variation in signalling behaviours, after controlling for aggressive behaviour, was individually consistent, suggesting there may be a second personality trait determining the level of aggressive signalling. We term this potential personality trait `communicativeness' and discuss these results in the context of honest signalling theories and recent findings reporting prevalence of `under-signalling'."

To better understand these implications, we develop a non-linear age-structured mathematical model to qualitatively examine the evolutionary consequences of a heritable boldness personality trait within an animal population. We assume that this heritable boldness trait is positively correlated with boldness towards predators and intraspecific aggressiveness. This assumption leads to a growth/reproductive success versus mortality trade-off, which is thoroughly investigated and documented in the literature. Another life-history trade-off we include in the model is future versus current reproduction, which was shown by Wolf et al. {[}1] to be a possible mechanism for the evolution of behavioural syndromes within an animal population. The stability of the system is analysed, whereby the characteristic equation is in the form of a homogeneous Fredholm equation of the second kind which depends on both the perturbation and equilibrium solution. The system is found to be stable due to the competition between individuals of similar boldness acting as a negative feedback mechanism. Using numerical simulations we examine the qualitative features of the solution to the system. In particular, we investigate the interplay between the mutation and competition strength between two individuals with different boldness, whereby we find that an increasing competition range acts to push individuals to both extremes of the shy-bold axis, while an increasing mutation range counteracts this effect. This qualitative trait of aggregation of individuals around the shy and bold extremes is also found when examining different birth, mortality and competition functions."

Here, we investigated the influence of social status on the expression and consistency of behaviours by experimentally changing social status between repeated personality assays. We used male domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a social species that forms relatively stable dominance hierarchies, and showed that behavioural responses were strongly affected by social status, but also by individual characteristics. The level of vigilance, activity and exploration changed with social status, whereas boldness appeared as a stable individual property, independent of status. Furthermore, variation in vocalization predicted future social status, indicating that individual behaviours can both be a predictor and a consequence of social status, depending on the aspect in focus. Our results illustrate that social states contribute to both variation and stability in behavioural responses, and should therefore be taken into account when investigating and interpreting variation in personality."

We have little knowledge of the long-term (as opposed to short-term) consistency of personality and the relationships between personality and behavioural flexibility in wild, free-living animals. This study investigates personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour) and contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in behaviour between contexts) of these traits in the Nazca booby (Sula granti), a long-lived, free-living seabird. We tested birds for personality in the field, during incubation, using a human intruder test, two novel object tests, and a social stimulus test (mirror), and determined repeatability of behavioural traits both within-season (short-term) and between several years (long-term). We found high short- and long-term repeatability of aggressive and anxiety-related behaviours when confronted with a nest intruder and novel objects, but lower repeatability during social stimulation. Contextual plasticity was highly repeatable across years for aggressive behaviours, and low for anxiety-related behaviours. Plasticity did not correlate across behaviours into a `meta-personality' trait. Contextual plasticity in behavioural traits was highly correlated with the expression of those traits, suggesting that individuals are able to both react strongly and modify their behaviour depending on context, perhaps due to consistent differences in individual quality. Model selection exercises using structural equation models evaluated the relationships between personality factors, indicating a behavioural syndrome in which anxiety- or agitation-related behaviours covary strongly and positively, and both covary weakly and negatively with aggression."

Ratings are seldom used despite being potentially more efficient than codings. One potential limitation for the use of ratings is that it is assumed that long-term observers or experts in the field are required to score individuals. This can be problematic in many cases, especially for long-term ecological studies where there is high turnover in personnel. We tested whether raters who were unacquainted with subjects could produce reliable and valid personality assessments of yellow-bellied marmots Marmota flaviventris. Two raters, previously unacquainted with individuals and marmot behavior, scored 130 subjects on fifteen different adjectives in both open-field (OF) and mirror image stimulation (MIS) trials. Eight OF and nine MIS adjectives were reliable as indicated by both a high degree of intra-observer and inter-observer reliability. Additionally, some ratings were externally valid, correlating with behavioral codings. Our data suggest that activity/exploration and sociability can be a reliable and valid measurement of personality traits in studies where raters were unacquainted with subjects. These traits are observable with the personality tests we used; otherwise researchers using unacquainted raters should be cautious in the tests they employ"

While the relationship between boldness across contexts and between boldness and aggression are frequently investigated, little is known about how these relationships might change because of environmental disturbances such as exposure to endocrine disrupters. 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) is an oestrogen mimic that is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide and has severe, negative impacts on the behaviour and physiology of exposed organisms. To assess how EE2 affects boldness and decision making, male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, received repeated trials of three boldness assays (novel environment, empty tank and novel object) and one decision-making assay (a dummy male and female presented simultaneously) before and after exposure to acute, nominal doses of EE2. A control group of males received the same number of trials but was not exposed to EE2. When subjects were unexposed, a behavioural syndrome was found for boldness across contexts. In addition, boldness was positively correlated with aggression in the decision-making context. EE2 exposure disrupted this behavioural syndrome. In summary, EE2 exposure reduced overall behavioural response in all contexts, disrupted the behavioural syndrome and reduced behavioural consistency. Thus, even nominal, short-term exposure to EE2 can have dramatic effects on multiple levels of behaviour and potentially generate severe fitness consequences on exposed aquatic species. This study provides the first evidence of a boldnesseaggression syndrome in this species and demonstrates that pollution may negatively influence consistent individual differences in behaviour.

Male Siamese fighting fish consistently adopt 1 of 3 behavioral strategies (i.e., fighter, lover, or divider) when encountering a male and female conspecific simultaneously. These strategies may carry fitness consequences if female conspecifics attend to these differences and use them when selecting mates. To address this question, female Siamese fighting fish were repeatedly presented with video playback images of males expressing these strategies in a series of preference tests. Subjects were exposed to male stimuli both sequentially and simultaneously. The results suggest that females prefer males using the lover strategy and actively avoid fighter males. This avoidance is found regardless of whether the male stimuli are presented sequentially or simultaneously. Although presentation type did not affect expressed preference, it did influence strength of preference, with females attending more to the divider and lover behavioral types in the simultaneous presentations. This study highlights the importance of using multiple presentation formats when examining mate preference and demonstrates that male behavioral type may influence female choice. In addition, it is one of the first examinations of how male behavioral type may influence female mate choice and suggests that female choice may be a mechanism for generating and/or maintaining differences in behavioral type."

Personality traits also affect habitat choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping), both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics."

Behavioral syndromes have potentially important ecological consequences (e.g. survivorship tradeoffs) and can be shaped by population dynamics through selective mortality. Here, we search for any evidence for consistency of behavior across situations in juveniles of a common damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at the transition between larval habitats in the plankton and juvenile habitats on the reef. Naive fish leaving the pelagic phase to settle on reefs were caught by light traps and their behaviors observed using similar methods across three different situations (small aquaria, large aquaria, field setting); all of which represent low risk and well-sheltered environments. Seven behavioral traits were compared within and among individuals across situations to determine if consistent behavioral syndromes existed. No consistency was found in any single or combination of behavioral traits for individuals across all situations. We suggest that high behavioral flexibility is likely beneficial for newly-settled fish at this ontogenetic transition and it is possible that consistent behavioral syndromes are unlikely to emerge in juveniles until environmental experience is gained or certain combinations of behaviors are favored by selective mortality."

Here we test the hypothesis that male three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) show high risk but potentially high return behaviours compared to females. According to this hypothesis we predicted that male fish would show greater exploration of their environment in a foraging context, and be caught sooner by an experimenter than females. We found that the time fish spent out of cover exploring their environment was correlated over two days, and males spent significantly more time out of cover than females. Also, the order in which fish were net-caught from their holding aquarium by an experimenter prior to experiments was negatively correlated with the time spent out of cover during tests, and males tended to be caught sooner than females. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between the catch number prior to our experiments and nine months after, pointing towards consistent, long-term individual differences in behaviour."

How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is important for determining the function and evolution of animal personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots' response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage. This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus, the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping with age-dependent requirements and constraints. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Personality has been quantified for a range of taxa (e. g., fish, songbirds, small mammals) but, so far, there has been little work on personality in bats, despite their diversity and potential as a model taxon for comparative studies. We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values associated with activity would increase between newly volant, pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a 24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats. Thus, we found evidence of short-term consistency of personality within individuals but with the potential for temporal flexibility of traits, depending on age."

Behaviours are, however, often plastic and to explain how plasticity and personality may coexist an adaptive framework has been developed. Still, there is little information on how personality is impacted by situations and contexts on an individual level. We investigated this in the European mink (Mustela lutreola) by performing a set of five experiments in two situations consisting of non-breeding and breeding season, and by using different test contexts. Three personality trait domains were identified; boldness, exploration and sociability. The levels of boldness and exploration changed between seasons but remained repeatable, which implies behavioural reaction norms and supports that the concept of personality remained applicable despite plasticity. Whilst males became bolder and more explorative in the breeding season females became shyer, which reflects European mink breeding behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours performed in mirror stimulus tests fell into different domains depending on whether, the test was conducted in the own territory or not, suggesting plasticity in the response towards conspecifics. To conclude, our results highlight the importance of situation and context for the expression of personality, and the significance of measuring multiple personality trait domains with several methods.

Furthermore, animals often show unpredictability in how much they respond to these events over time leading to the suggestion that personality and intraindividual variability (IIV) might have important fitness consequences. We investigated this hypothesis by focusing on the tendency for individually identifiable male fallow deer, Dama dama, to escalate low-level (noncontact) agonistic interactions to fighting during the rut. Males differed in their tendency to escalate noncontact interactions to fighting; however, repeatability in escalation rates was unstable over the rut suggesting that escalation rate is a poor measure of personality. There was no difference in the level of IIV in escalation rate shown by males. A comparison of IIV recorded over two consecutive annual ruts showed that IIV was highly correlated between years; therefore, over an extended time period individuals were consistent in their willingness to engage in fighting. There was a nonlinear relationship between IIV and mating success; specifically, individuals that showed either low or high IIV in escalation rate had lower mating success than individuals that showed intermediate levels of IIV. Aggression and the willingness to commit to fighting are important fitness correlates; nevertheless, our understanding of how personality and IIV are related to aggression is poorly understood. This study shows that although escalation rate appears to be a poor measure of personality in the fallow deer, IIV is related to increased fitness in individuals that show intermediate levels of predictability in their willingness to fight over the rut.

Most studies on mate choice and personality have focused on female preference and have showed that females prefer to mate with bolder males. However, the influence of the females personality on this mate preference and on her compatibility with a mate with particular traits has been largely neglected. Here, using the guppy Poecilia reticulata, we investigated the effect of female boldness on mate choice and of the combinations of this trait in the male and female of a mating pair on parturition and brood size. Our results showed that female boldness did not affect mate choice, and brood size was independent of the boldness of the male and female in a pair. However, overall, females who mated with males with a dissimilar degree of boldness to themselves had a lower parturition success than females who mated with males with a similar degree of boldness. This work suggests that the combination of boldness characteristics within a pair influences reproductive success and that individuals of similar personality are more compatible in reproduction. The lower success of disassortative matings is consistent with the hypothesis that variation in personalities is maintained by disruptive or frequency-dependent selection, driven by contrasting physical or social environments that favor alternative rather than intermediate behavioral phenotypes."

Although any behavior might be context specific, studies using this single assay type must assume it reflects boldness in other similar contexts, otherwise it cannot reflect personality (defined as consistency across time and/or contexts). We attempted to validate whether a single assay of this type is correlated with other similar assays of boldness under more familiar, and less stressful, situations. We compared single emergence test scores of two species of damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi; P.amboinensis) in a novel environment, with two different behavioral assays of the same fish in subsequent repeated trials in home tanks. Although behavior was highly repeatable in home tanks, we found no correlation between emergence test scores in the novel environment and measures of latency to emerge from shelter following disturbance, or activity levels, on the first, second, or third observations in home tanks; there was also no correlation when we used average home tank scores from mixed models that accounted for individual differences (i.e., plasticity) in the rate of habituation (latency) and acclimation (activity).

Recent developments have focused on the individual, seeking patterns of behaviour that are stable over time and/or across different contexts (animal personalities). This study applied this method of understanding individual behavioural variability to domestic guinea pigs. Two behavioural domains were investigated: emotionality and social behaviour. Additionally, individual cortisol-stress reactivity and dominance status were examined. Adult male domestic guinea pigs living in large mixed-sex colonies were subjected to a series of behavioural and physiological tests twice with an intertest interval of 8wk. Individual consistency over time was found regarding social behaviour, cortisol reactivity and dominance status, whereas no stability regarding emotional behaviour was detected. Furthermore, no stability over contexts was found. Our results suggest that the concept of animal personality is applicable to domestic guinea pigs. The ecological relevance of these data is underscored by the fact that they were obtained in animals from a very rich, socially complex scenario. Moreover, our study highlights that behaviour alone is not sufficient to describe individual phenotypic consistency. Physiological parameters such as stress reactivity should be included in animal personality research. Furthermore dominance - a relative measure which is not an absolute attribute of individuals - proved to be stable over time and thus also shed light on individuality."

Vacancy chains describe sequences of linked vacancy moves in systems where individuals use discrete and reuseable resource units. When a new resource unit becomes available, this can cause a cascade of moves between resource units, beyond the first individual that encounters the new unit. Thus, vacancy chains can drive the distribution of resources through a population. Here, I investigate the effect of variation in boldness on movements between vacant gastropod shells in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Boldness was quantified using the duration of a startle response, which varied consistently between individuals. In groups of five crabs, introduction of a single new shell led to aggregate benefits, in terms of improving shell quality, across all group members. Boldness did not influence the extent of these benefits or the extent to which they were distributed between crabs of different sizes. Initially, vacancy chains were longer, indicating that more individuals moved between shells, for bold groups compared with shy groups. After 24h, however, the chain length was longer for shy groups. Thus, although participation in a vacancy chain may lead to similar benefits, these could be more widespread for groups comprising shy individuals that show long startle responses, low inquisitiveness and low aggression. Similar effects on resource acquisition could be present in other examples of animals that utilise reusable resource units and show consistent between-individual differences in behaviour."

While genetic and maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations, teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors, neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions, hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians."

RR estimates the between-individual variance in elevation (expected behavior in the mean environment) and variance in plasticity (individual-specific adjustment of behavior to the environment) and the covariance between these properties. These (co)variances allow deriving both environment-specific repeatability estimates and the individual-level correlation in behavior between environmental conditions, both of which are of key interest for understanding consistency in behavior over space and time, a core issue in animal personality research. However, very few studies use the RR estimates to produce this information. In this paper, I outline how to extract this information (including example code in R) and apply the approach to 16 estimates based on nine published RR studies. Despite the fact that the behaviors have a decent repeatability under different environmental conditions, I find that in half the cases, the cross-environmental correlation is low (< 0.4). This implies that individuals differ in their behavioral trait values but that the ranking of these individual values tends to change between environmental conditions. This level of inconsistency in animal personality traits appears not to have been fully appreciated, and future studies on plasticity using RR should explicitly include it."

Individual specialization within groups can increase colony efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism. Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics. Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance. Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social organization in a diversity of animals."

Male bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, show extensive consistent behavioural variation in their levels of courtship, male-directed aggression and female-directed aggression, resulting in a range of fitness-related behavioural types coexisting within a population. To determine whether the behavioural components underlying a male's stable behavioural type in the mating context are heritable and genetically correlated, we performed paternal half-sib crosses. Using animal models, we found that all three of these mating behaviours were moderately heritable (h(2) = 0.17-0.29) and courtship behaviour was also heritable as a binomial trait (court yes/no: h(2) = 0.50). Including effects of dam identity/common rearing environment experienced by full sibs decreased model fit, suggesting that early social interactions might contribute to behavioural types. In addition, we found evidence consistent with the possibility that the positive phenotypic correlations among mating behaviours are underlain by positive genetic correlations. Thus, it is possible that the seemingly maladaptive aggression that males direct towards females during social interactions persist due to genetic constraints and direct selection on male-directed aggression and courtship behaviour.

Game theoretical and bet-hedging models have suggested two ways that a single genotype might generate variable behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete rather than continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces different types of individuals, each of which consistently expresses a different type of behaviour) or stochastic variability (a genotype produces one type of individual that randomly expresses different types of behaviour over time). We first demonstrated significant differences across 14 natural genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the variability (as measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice in an experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four different types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about ways that within-individual variability might contribute to differences across genotypes in the variability of microhabitat choice. There was no empirical support for three hypotheses (behavioural polymorphism, consistent choice, or time-based choice), nor could our results be attributed to genotypic differences in activity levels. The stochastic variability hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept of the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the individual level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our initial version of the stochastic model slightly but significantly overestimated the values of individual entropy for each genotype, pointing to specific assumptions of this model that might need to be adjusted in future studies of the IGV of microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of recent studies to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and the first to explore ways that genotypic differences in within-individual variability might contribute to differences among genotypes in the predictability of their behaviour.

Hypotheses for the coexistence of behavioral differences fall into 3 categories: variation in selection, frequency-dependent selection, and behavioral plasticity. We tested predictions of those hypotheses regarding geographic covariation of behavior with ecology, using a recent (40 years) biological invasion of common waxbills (Estrilda astrild). Behavior in tests for exploration and social interaction covaried among individuals, suggesting a behavioral syndrome, although we could only demonstrate within-individual repeatability in the test for social interaction. These 2 behaviors changed geographically with the ecology of sites (degree of climate variation) in an apparently adaptive way, rather than with the direction of invasion. We found behavioral plasticity but showed that short-term plastic effects do not explain geographic divergence. Differential dispersal does not explain geographic divergence either, which is orthogonal to the direction of invasion. Results are best interpreted either as evolved divergences, although a candidate-gene approach could not identify genetic correlates of behavior, or as long-term behavioral plasticity (e.g., effects of rearing environment). In this recent invasion, geographic differences in ecology and behavior equate to repeated and fast changes over time. Thus, fluctuations in ecological conditions, which are common in nature, may have a widespread role maintaining behavioral and personality differences via selection and/or long-term behavioral plasticity."

We investigated the roosting decisions of free-living great tits utilizing nest-boxes in response to the installation of a novel object (a miniature video camera) inside their nest-boxes. We show that birds that score highly on a widely used exploration test (i.e., fast explorers) are more likely to accept and approach novel objects used in a seemingly unobtrusive sampling technique; thus, the sample collected overrepresents fast explorers. This form of behavior-related bias, sensitivity to novel objects, has largely been overlooked in sampling design.

We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution."

The aim of this study is to establish the personality structure of crested macaque (Macaca nigra) males as foundation for future studies on its adaptive value. We collected behavioral data through focal animal sampling and additionally conducted two sets of playback experiments. Results of a factor analysis on the behavioral data revealed a four factor structure with components we labeled Anxiety, Sociability, Connectedness and Aggressiveness. Results from the experiments revealed an additional and independent Boldness factor but the absence of Neophilia. Overall, this structure resembles other macaque and animal species with the exception of Connectedness, which might be a consequence of the species' tolerant social style. Our results thus not only form the basis for future studies on the adaptive value of personality in crested macaques but also contribute an important data point for investigating the evolution of personality structure from a comparative perspective by refining, for example, which personality factors characterized the last common ancestor of hominids and macaques."

This study looked at the Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia), a critically endangered species, with only an estimated 400 left in the wild. Raters assessed 25 Scottish wildcats on 42 traits and on a subjective well-being questionnaire. Mean inter-rater reliability on the personality items was 0.59 and 0.53 on the subjective well-being items. Three personality components were found using principal-components analysis: Dominance, Agreeableness, and Self Control.

Historically, the fitness consequences of behavioural types (e.g. bold and shy) have been investigated in one focal species at a time. Studies generally disregard variation in heterospecifics that interact with those types. However, intraspecific variation in behavioural types of multiple interactors could generate dependent effects of behavioural type x behavioural type in species interactions and might serve as a mechanism maintaining phenotypic variation in wild populations. Here we examined how behavioural types of both predators and prey jointly determine the outcome of a predatoreprey interaction using the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, and a syntopic field cricket, Gryllus integer. We assayed the antipredator (boldness) behaviour of individual G. integer and the boldness during foraging site selection of individual L. hesperus, as estimated by the spiders' tendency to settle in safe versus high-risk foraging environments. The best-fit models predicting prey survivorship and predator foraging success indicate that the behavioural tendencies of both predator and prey, as well as the interaction between them, jointly affect the outcome of staged predatoreprey interactions. These models boasted R-2 values 3-10 times those of models that considered behavioural type variation in either predator or prey alone. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the behavioural types of multiple interactors when testing the effects of behavioural types on species interactions and individual performance. More generally, our results strongly suggest that attention should be paid to multiple interactors if we are to understand the outcomes of species interactions.

However, empirical studies to establish the efficacy of training or investigate its impact on keeper-animal relationships are scarce; this was the topic of the current investigation. Study animals were classified as formally trained (FT) partially trained (PT) or untrained (UT). Eight black rhinoceros (2FT, 2PT \& 4UT), twelve Sulawesi crested black macaques (4FT, 4PT \& 4UT) and eleven Chapman zebra (4FT, 2PT \& 5UT) were studied in 6 zoos across the UK and USA. Subtle cues and commands provided by keepers directed towards the animals were identified and the latency between these and the respective behavioural responses (cue-response) were recorded. Animal personalities were also assessed using trait ratings completed by keepers for each animal. Social species (zebra and macaques) responded quicker to cues than the solitary species (rhino; F-2 = 13.716, p < 0.001). FT animals responded quicker to keeper cues than PT and UT animals (F-2,F-22= 6.131, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the cue-response latencies according to personality traits (Z = -1.576, p > 0.05). Data suggested that trained group living animals had reduced latencies when reacting to keeper's cues, regardless of their personality. If we consider short cue-response latencies to be indicative of low fear, then we suggest that training can potentially reduce animals' fear of humans thus could contribute to positive keeper-animal relationships which in turn could lead to improved animal welfare.

However, this does not mean that the behaviour of a given individual is readily predictable. While some individuals show low levels of variation around their behavioural mean, others show high levels of variation, and there may be significant between-individual differences in this intraindividual variation ('IIV') in behaviour. While it has been suggested that IIV might reduce susceptibility to predators, little is known about the functions or causation of IIV. We investigated the effects of temperature on the startle response duration of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus. For poikilothermic animals, temperature has a direct and multiplicative influence on metabolic rate, which in turn is expected to influence behaviour because of its effect on energy requirements. At the level of mean startle response durations, the effect of temperature was dependent on treatment order; within treatment orders, individuals showed different reaction norms. In contrast, at the level of IIV, while the presence of significant between-individual differences was dependent on treatment order, there was a clear unidirectional effect in both treatment orders for individuals to be less predictable at higher temperature. Thus, predictability in behaviour appears to vary with a key environmental variable that is known to influence energy requirements and potentially the level of risk that individuals are willing to accept.

Whether behavioral syndromes also influence the course of evolution in this manner remains unknown. Here, we provide the first test of the degree to which evolutionary responses might be affected by behavioral syndrome structure. This test, based on a meta-analysis of additive genetic variancecovariance matrices, shows that behavioral syndromes constrain potential evolutionary responses by an average of 33\%. For comparison, correlations between life-history or between morphological traits suggest constraints of 1318\%. This finding demonstrates that behavioral syndromes might substantially constrain the evolutionary trajectories available to populations, prompts novel future directions for the study of behavioral syndromes, emphasizes the importance of viewing syndrome research from an evolutionary perspective, and provides a bridge between syndrome research and theoretical quantitative genetics."

A general question is how such differences referred to as personalities are maintained through evolution. One suggested mechanism is a nonrandom mate choice, which has been supported in species in which mate choice associates with direct material benefits. Much less is known about mating patterns and personality in species where males provide only sperm and in which the benefits of female choice are based only on good and/or compatible genes. The bridge spider Larinioides sclopetarius Clerck (Araneidae) exhibits heritable between-individual differences in intrasex aggressiveness. We studied mating probabilities by aggressiveness type of both sexes, and success in sperm competition of aggressive versus nonaggressive males. We staged trials that resemble field conditions: 4 males (2 aggressive and 2 nonaggressive) had simultaneous choice between an aggressive and a nonaggressive female. Although there were no differences in initial approaches of male types toward female types, aggressive males mainly mated with aggressive females, and nonaggressive males more likely mated with nonaggressive females. Female aggressiveness type was not related to fecundity, which may be a consequence of equal food supply in the laboratory. However, in double-mating trials using the sterile-male technique to measure paternity of aggressive versus nonaggressive males, we found that sons of aggressive parents fathered relatively more offspring. We conclude that assortative mating by aggressiveness type might maintain between-individual differences in aggressiveness in L. sclopetarius."

This is because life history and personality have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes. Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range: encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history variation."

If so, then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here, we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were also detected. A single vector explains 80 \% of the among-individual variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness. We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through impacts on resource acquisition."

Animal personality has recently been integrated into the pace-of-life-syndrome hypothesis, relating individual behavioural traits to life history. Variation in cognitive traits could be explained well by this theoretical framework. A risk-reward trade-off might lead to different cognitive types: Active birds that learn fast, take risks and probably have a fast lifestyle and less active, slow learning birds that are risk averse but thereby perform better in reversal learning as they probably pay more attention to external cues. We investigated the performance of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in a cognitively challenging reversal learning task and linked this to two personality traits: activity and fearfulness. Male birds were better in reversal learning than females. While no personality-related differences occurred in the initial learning of our task, more active and fearful birds relearned the cue-reward association faster. While birds of different sex might have revealed different risk-taking strategies in the training, our findings do not reveal the expected direction of a risk-reward trade-off in the reversal learning. It seems likely that a more general and personality-related cognitive ability might improve performance across different tasks. The linkage between personality and cognition documented here could hence suggest that cognitive traits are indeed part of an overall pace-of-life syndrome."

In the case of captive birds, locomotor activity can be divided into two major components - frequency of hopping and flapping flight bouts, which may conceive different information about individual condition. This idea was tested in a 2{*}2 factorial experiment in wild-caught captive greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or temporarily exposed to an image of a predator. We predicted that LPS injection would reduce both types of activity via induction of sickness syndrome and that predator image treatment would either increase or decrease different components of activity. Both behavioural traits were similarly consistent in time over a 10-d period but the correlations between them depended on measurement context. LPS treatment reduced flapping and hopping frequencies and total locomotor activity. Exposure to the predator image had no effect on flapping frequency, but it decreased hopping frequency and total locomotor activity among the birds that were initially most active. The effects of both treatments on behaviour were relatively long-lasting, that is, detectable at least 87h after LPS injection and 44h after exposure to the predator image. Our findings demonstrate the existence of two components of locomotor activity that responded similarly to the physiological but differently to the psychological stressor. The distinction between such components thus increases the information content of activity recordings of caged birds, which is likely to reveal novel aspects of covariation between different aspects of stress responsiveness and other performance parameters."

Behavioral traits may therefore influence insecticide efficacy against insects, compromising the validity of standard bioassays of insecticide activity, which are fundamentally based on lethality alone. By extension, insect `personality' (i.e., an individual's integrated set of behavioral tendencies that is inferred from multiple empirical measures) may also be an important determinant of insecticide exposure and activity. This has yet to be considered because the behavioral studies involving insects and insecticides focus on populations rather than on individuals. Even among studies of animal `personality', the relative contributions of individual and population variation are usually neglected. Here, we assessed behavioral traits (within the categories: activity, boldness/shyness, and exploration/avoidance) of individuals from 15 populations of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), an important stored-grain pest with serious problems of insecticide resistance, and correlated the behavioral responses with the activity of the insecticide deltamethrin. This analysis was performed at both the population and individual levels. There was significant variation in weevil `personality' among individuals and populations, but variation among individuals within populations accounted for most of the observed variation (92.57\%). This result emphasizes the importance of individual variation in behavioral and `personality' studies. When the behavioral traits assessed were correlated with median lethal time (LT50) at the population level and with the survival time under insecticide exposure, activity traits, particularly the distance walked, significantly increased survival time. Therefore, behavioral traits are important components of insecticide efficacy, and individual variation should be considered in such studies. This is so because population differences provided only crude approximation of the individual personality in a restrained experimental setting likely to restrict individual behavior favoring the transposition of the individual variation to the population."

In female house mice, a selfish genetic element, the t haplotype, is associated with increased longevity under natural conditions, representing an appropriate case study to investigate this recent theory empirically. Following theory, females heterozygous for the t haplotype (+/t) are hypothesised to express more reactive personality traits and be more shy, less explorative and less active compared to the shorter-lived homozygous wildtype females (+/+). As males of different haplotype do not differ in survival, no similar pattern is expected. We tested these predictions by quantifying boldness, exploration, activity, and energetic intake in both +/t and +/+ mice. +/t females, unlike +/+ ones, expressed some reactive-like personality traits: +/t females were less active, less prone to form an exploratory routine and tended to ingest less food. Taken together these results suggest that differences in animal personality may contribute to the survival advantage observed in +/t females but fail to provide full empirical support for recent theory."

Since the adaptive value of boldness is context dependent, the benefit of a distinct personality is less clear when the environment is unpredictable. An ability to modulate behaviour can be beneficial, although as behavioural plasticity itself may be costly this depends on the levels of environmental stability. Both boldness and its plasticity are linked with physiological stress coping mechanisms, whereby animals with reduced glucocorticoid responses to stress are bolder and less flexible in behaviour. We investigated the behavioural changes made by bold and shy rainbow trout, and the magnitude of those changes, in response to predation risk and exposure to two environmental challenges. Behavioural and physiological responses under biotic (either no, predictable or unpredictable predation risk) and abiotic (temperature increase or hypoxia) factors were measured. Boldness was determined using a standard novel object paradigm. In general, after exposure to the treatments, fish exhibited less extreme bold or shy behaviour; the greatest change was observed in fish exposed to hypoxia, or those exposed to high risk particularly in shy fish held at a lower temperature. Higher risk also resulted in increased stress, suggesting that extreme bold or shy behaviour might have been maladaptive under a potential predator threat. These results represent novel evidence that boldness is flexible depending upon particular environmental challenges, with important implications for populations facing environmental extremes caused by anthropogenic activity and climate change.

We made specific a priori predictions for how subjectively measured personality should relate to behaviour testing. We found that Extroversion predicted time to complete a handling test and refusal behaviour during this test. It also predicted minimum distance to a novel object. Neuroticism predicted how reactive an individual was to a sudden visual stimulus but not how quickly it recovered from this. Agreeableness did not predict any behaviour during testing. There were several unpredicted correlations between subjective measures and behaviour tests which we explore further. Our second aim was to combine data from the subjective assessment and behaviour tests to gain a more comprehensive understanding of personality. We found that the combination of methods provides new insights into horse behaviour. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the idea of horses showing different coping styles, a novel finding for this species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Taking this gambit implies accepting that the between-individual correlation in behavioral traits (which is the correlation of interest) may be masked by a residual correlation of different magnitude or sign. Understanding (co)variances on different levels is the main thrust of quantitative genetics, and animal personality research can make good use of the plethora of ideas and analytical approaches developed in this field. I, here, outline reasons why the ``individual gambit{''} may or may not work out and its relationship to the quantitative genetic ``phenotypic gambit{''}. I especially emphasize the meaning of residuals and phenotypic plasticity which has not been fully appreciated in the debate thus far. I conclude that instead of a priori assuming that between-individual correlations are captured sufficiently well by the phenotypic correlation, animal personality researchers should set up more ambitious data collection and analysis designs to critically test this conjectured equality."

Yet, the impacts of noise may depend not only on noise characteristics but also on an individual's coping style or personality. We tested whether noise is more disturbing if it masks communication signals, and whether characteristics of both the noise and the individual affect its impact. Using a unique population of personality-typed great tits, Parus major, we tested whether the kind of noise and parental personality affect parental nestbox visits and nestling begging. Nestboxes were exposed to automated noise playbacks, differing in spectral composition (noise masking begging calls, nonmasking noise or no noise). Parental nestbox visits were recorded using RFID transponders. Video and audio recordings were used to quantify nestling begging. Nestlings mainly begged in silence and in the presence of parents. Parents reduced nestbox visits during noise treatments regardless of the kind of noise and initially reacted more strongly to nonmasking noise. Moreover, slower explorers took longer to enter the nestbox during noise than faster explorers. Total visit rates during noise depended on parental sex and personality. In females, bolder individuals, but in males shyer individuals, reduced total visits during noise. These results extend previous findings in showing experimentally that the disturbance effects of noise do not depend on whether or not the noise directly interferes with information exchange by masking signals. Moreover, personality- and sex-specific responses to noise indicate that anthropogenic disturbance can differentially affect individuals within populations, which will influence mitigation strategies.

Moreover, behavioral type-environment correlations have important ecological and evolutionary implications. However, few studies have examined behavioral type-environment correlations in natural populations. In this study, we asked whether some behavioral types of three-spined stickleback were more likely to occur in certain social environments (alone or in a shoal with other stickleback) or in certain microhabitats in a river (in the open or under cover). We found that individuals that were in shoals with other stickleback at the time of collection from the field emerged from a refuge more quickly compared to individuals that were found alone. In addition, fish that were alone in an open microhabitat explored more of a pool compared to fish that were alone in cover, but this difference did not occur among fish that were in shoals at the time of collection. Subsequent analyses of gut contents suggested that differences in microhabitat use were consistent over time. Our study provides some of the first evidence for behavioral type-environment correlations in a natural population of non-human animals."

Here, we assess the roles of correlated selection and divergent rearing environments in generating a syndrome between foraging aggressiveness and boldness in the spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica. We first tested for and confirmed the presence of a behavioral syndrome between boldness and foraging aggressiveness in wild penultimate A.pennsylvanica (r=0.24). Then, to assess the effects of rearing environment on the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome, we compared the behavioral tendencies of field- vs. laboratory-reared spiders over the course of their development. The presence of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome differed based on spiders' developmental stage and rearing environment: field-reared juveniles did not exhibit a syndrome between boldness and foraging aggressiveness, but field-reared penultimates did. In contrast, laboratory-reared spiders never exhibited a behavioral syndrome, regardless of their developmental stage. Thus, the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome in A.pennsylvanica manifests only when individuals are reared in the field. Selection data from a markrecapture study failed to indicate any signature of correlated selection, despite our finding that at least one element of the syndrome (foraging aggressiveness) can respond to selection (Heritability h2=0.27, from mid-parent breeding study). Thus, contemporary correlated selection does not appear to be a major driver of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome of A.pennsylvanica. Taken together, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome exhibited by wild A.pennsylvanica develops as a result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, and not correlated selection."

We here applied a reaction-norm perspective implemented as a random regression phenotypic model (RRPM) to behaviors measured on blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus.

Activity was found to be repeatable both within and across seasonal contexts, but escape time and neophobia-related behavior were repeatable only in winter. Our RRPM confirmed that this latter finding was due to crossing of the individual-specific reaction norms between the 2 seasonal contexts. Our work illustrates how a behavior measured in a standardized manner may or may not be repeatable across time within a context but not between contexts, depending on the interindividual variation in reaction-norm properties. Our findings suggest that research on animal behavior plasticity can benefit from taking onboard context-specific analyses in a more explicit manner than what is typically done."

Individual differences in behaviour are no longer recognised as noise around a mean but rather as adaptive variation and thus, essentially, raw material for evolution. Animal personality has been considered evolutionary conserved and has been shown to be present in all vertebrates including fish. Despite the importance of evolutionary and comparative aspects in this field, few studies have actually documented consistency across situations in fish. In addition, most studies are done with individually housed fish which may pose additional challenges when interpreting data from social species. Here, we investigate, for the first time in fish, whether individual differences in behavioural responses to a variety of challenges are consistent over time and across contexts using both individual and grouped-based tests. Twenty-four juveniles of Gilthead seabream Sparus aurata were subjected to three individual-based tests: feed intake recovery in a novel environment, novel object and restraining and to two group-based tests: risk-taking and hypoxia. Each test was repeated twice to assess consistency of behavioural responses over time. Risk taking and escape behaviours during restraining were shown to be significantly consistent over time. In addition, consistency across contexts was also observed: individuals that took longer to recover feed intake after transfer into a novel environment exhibited higher escape attempts during a restraining test and escaped faster from hypoxia conditions. These results highlight the possibility to predict behaviour in groups from individual personality traits."

Here we present data from a behavioural study of rock pool prawns. We show that prawns are temporally consistent in a range of behaviours, including activity, exploration and boldness, and also that a behavioural syndrome is evident in this population. We find correlations between many behavioural traits (activity, boldness, shoaling and exploration). In addition, behavioural syndrome structure was consistent over time. Finally, few studies have explicitly studied the role of sex differences in personality traits, behavioural consistency and syndrome structure. We report behavioural differences between male and female prawns but no differences in patterns of consistency. Our study adds to the growing literature on animal personality, and provides evidence showing that syndromes themselves can exhibit temporal consistency."

However, little is known in how far the environment an individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas it is well established that the environment can have profound influences on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3 personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder, thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive."

One particularly important topic in this context is how individuals' variation in behaviour shapes group-level characteristics. We investigated how fish that express different locomotory behaviour in an asocial context move collectively when in groups. First, we established that individual fish have characteristic, repeatable locomotion behaviours (i.e. median speeds, variance in speeds and median turning speeds) when tested on their own. When tested in groups of two, four or eight fish, we found individuals partly maintained their asocial median speed and median turning speed preferences, while their variance in speed preference was lost. The strength of this individuality decreased as group size increased, with individuals conforming to the speed of the group, while also decreasing the variability in their own speed. Further, individuals adopted movement characteristics that were dependent on what group size they were in. This study therefore shows the influence of social context on individual behaviour. If the results found here can be generalized across species and contexts, then although individuality is not entirely lost in groups, social conformity and group-size-dependent effects drive how individuals will adjust their behaviour in groups."

A fundamental factor underlying such differences is believed to be the degree to which individual behavior is guided by environmental stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in the wild using free-ranging great tits. Personality variation was quantified using exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, which has previously been shown to be repeatable and correlated with other behaviours in this and other populations of the same species. By temporarily removing food at feeding stations we examined whether birds with different personality differed in returning to visit empty feeders as this may provide information on how birds continue to sample their environment after a sudden change in conditions. In two summer experiments, we found that fast-exploring juveniles visited empty feeders less often compared to slow-exploring juveniles. In winter, sampling behaviour was sex dependent but not related to personality. In both seasons, we found that birds who sampled empty feeders more often were more likely to rediscover food after we again re-baited the feeding stations, but there was no effect of personality. Our results show that personality types may indeed differ in ways of collecting environmental information, which is consistent with the view of personalities as different styles of coping with environmental changes. The adaptive value of these alternative behavioural tactics, however, needs to be further explored."

Hypotheses for the ultimate causes of sexual cannibalism either invoke the behavior as adaptive ormal-adaptive. Adaptive hypotheses consider foraging decisions, mate choice or genetic bet-hedging. Mal-adaptive hypotheses propose that sexual cannibalism is the result of mistaken species identity or the by product of an aggression syndrome. Here, we test the latter hypothesis, that sexual cannibalism is the result of an aggression syndrome. This hypothesis states that aggressive behavior is favored in the foraging context because females benefit from achieving a large size quickly through an increase in fecundity, and it predicts that individuals that are aggressive foragers are more likely to attack a male and hence are at risk of receiving no or insufficient quantities of sperm. Few tests of this hypothesis are available to date, and only one involved a species with sexual cannibalism occurring after at least some sperm transfer. We test the hypothesis in Argiope aurantia, a species in which females frequently attack males during copulation. We estimated aggressiveness in the foraging context in penultimate and adults females and staged matings using the same females to evaluate whether aggressiveness during the foraging context predicts the likelihood of sexual cannibalism. Indeed, we find that aggressive foragers are more likely to attack their mates, but we conclude that other, possibly adaptive reasons for cannibalism exist as much of the uncertainty in cannibalism occurrence remained unexplained."

The study of phenotypic plasticity in the wild can shed new light on the ultimate objectives (1) whether plasticity itself can evolve or is constrained by its genetic architecture, and (2) whether plasticity is associated to other traits, including fitness (selection). I describe the main statistical approach for how repeated records of individuals and a description of the environment (E) allow quantification of variation in plasticity across individuals (IxE) and genotypes (GxE) in wild populations. Based on a literature review of life-history and behavioural studies on plasticity in the wild, I discuss the present state of the two objectives listed above. Few studies have quantified GxE of labile traits in wild populations, and it is likely that power to detect statistically significant GxE is lacking. Apart from the issue of whether it is heritable, plasticity tends to correlate with average trait expression (not fully supported by the few genetic estimates available) and may thus be evolutionary constrained in this way. Individual-specific estimates of plasticity tend to be related to other traits of the individual (including fitness), but these analyses may be anti-conservative because they predominantly concern stats-on-stats. Despite the increased interest in plasticity in wild populations, the putative lack of power to detect GxE in such populations hinders achieving general insights. I discuss possible steps to invigorate the field by moving away from simply testing for presence of GxE to analyses that `scale up' to population level processes and by the development of new behavioural theory to identify quantitative genetic parameters which can be estimated."

However, at present relatively few studies present such data, and few consider how changing abiotic conditions affect behavioural plasticity. Individual differences in metabolic rate have been suggested as a proximate mechanism promoting personality, leading one to speculate that individual differences in metabolic sensitivity to temperature may affect behavioural responses in ectotherms. At present, only one study (out of two) has tested for and shown individual differences in behavioural responses to temperature. Here, we repeatedly assayed the behaviour of a marine crab across a narrow range of temperatures to test for individual differences in responses to temperature. We observed large inter-individual differences in behaviour that were consistent over time at a given temperature (evidence for personality), and individual differences in responses to temperature (evidence for plasticity). This study adds to the very scant literature on ectotherm behavioural sensitivity to temperature, and suggests the phenomenon might be widespread. We speculate about the role of metabolism as a proximate mechanism that might explain these individual differences in plasticity and make suggestions for future research to test this hypothesis."

Studies of behavioral syndromes repeatedly measure the same individuals to quantify within-individual consistency and between-individual variation in behavior. Often these studies measure behavior in different contexts or in different behavioral assays to determine whether individual differences in behavior in one context are related to behavior in other contexts, that is, if there is a behavioral syndrome. For studies of behavioral syndromes, there is not universal agreement about whether it is preferable to randomize the order of different assays or to administer them in a fixed order. Here, I articulate the advantages and disadvantages of testing in a randomized or fixed order and offer some recommendations according to the goals and power of the experiment. In general, studies using within-subjects designs that are primarily interested in mean-level differences between treatments should randomize the order that individuals experience different treatments. Under certain conditions, studies of behavioral syndromes should also administer the assays in a randomized order, but only if the study is sufficiently powerful to statistically account for carryover and period effects. If the experimenter is interested in behavioral syndromes that are caused by carryovers, it is often preferable to test in a fixed order. If the experimenter wants to guard against carryovers, but the experiment is not sufficiently powerful to account for carryover and period effects, then a compromise is to test in a fixed order, but to test individuals in the context that is most likely to affect subsequent behavior last."

Results show that, irrespective of the feeding regime, the growth of juvenile brown trout increased with the expression of active foraging behavior and, similarly, with increasing use of shelter. Conversely, territorial aggressive behavior only promoted growth when food resources Were spatially and temporally predictable, and only for individuals that had high metabolic rates (when compared with their low metabolic rate siblings). Thus, this study shows that only certain behaviors are associated with variation in the physiology of individuals. Moreover, only certain behaviors associate differently with growth under different environmental conditions. These results are partially consistent with the hypothesis that environmental variability promotes the coexistence of alternative behavioral phenotypes. However, some behaviors enhanced growth irrespective of feeding regime, and we did not identify a set of conditions where fish with low resting metabolic rate (RMR) outperformed their high RMR siblings. Hence, additional layers of environmental variation are likely to be required for individuals with low RMR to show maximal growth performance."

Recent studies have revealed that consistent within-species variation in behavior (i.e., animal personality) can be imperative for dispersal success, a key process in range expansion. Here we investigate how habitat isolation can mediate differentiation of personality traits between recently founded island populations and the main population. We performed laboratory studies of boldness and exploration across life stages (tadpoles and froglets) using four isolated island populations and four mainland populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Both tadpoles and froglets from isolated populations were bolder and more exploratory than conspecifics from the mainland. Although the pattern can be influenced by possible differences in predation pressure, we suggest that this behavioral differentiation might be the result of a disperser-dependent founder effect brought on by an isolation-driven environmental filtering of animal personalities. These findings can have important implications for both species persistence in the face of climate change (i.e., range expansions) and ecological invasions as well as for explaining rapid speciation in isolated patches."

Such `animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed adjust their `exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour, to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability. We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future fitness expectations."

Individuals can either search for food sources themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities. Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a divergence of exploration `types' within a given environment, but there was a general association between exploration and scrounging across different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both."

However, despite numerous theoretical explanations there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour. However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test. Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity, physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment matching."

However, most of the studies in this research area have been performed in adult animals. Trait variations expressed early in development and how they are related to the ontogeny of an animal's personality are far less studied. Genetic differences as well as environmental factors causing functional variability of the central serotonergic system have been related to personality differences in vertebrates, including humans. Such gene-environment interplay suggests that the central serotonergic system plays an important role in the ontogeny of personality traits. In salmonid fishes, the timing of emergence from spawning nests is related to energy reserves, aggression, and social dominance. However, it is currently unknown how the size of the yolk reserve is reflected on aggression and dominance, or if these traits are linked to differences in serotonergic transmission in newly emerged larvae. In this study we investigated the relationship between yolk reserves, social dominance, and serotonergic transmission in newly emerged rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae. This was conducted by allowing larvae with the same emergence time, but with different yolk sizes, to interact in pairs for 24 h. The results show that individuals with larger yolks performed more aggressive acts, resulting in a suppression of aggression in individuals with smaller yolks. A higher brain serotonergic activity confirmed subordination in larvae with small yolks. The relationship between social dominance and yolk size was present in siblings, demonstrating a link between interfamily variation in energy reserves and aggression, and suggests that larger yolk reserves fuel a more aggressive personality during the initial territorial establishment in salmonid fishes. Furthermore, socially naive larvae with big yolks had lower serotonin levels, suggesting that other factors than the social environment causes variation in serotonergic transmission, underlying individual variation in aggressive behavior."

This is particularly the case when it comes to developmental processes and understanding how behaviors change over ontogeny. Such developmental perspectives are essential given that the vast majority of animal species possess complex life cycles or undergo some form of metamorphosis. Yet, in spite of the broad taxonomic relevance and the obvious potential importance of metamorphosis for understanding the basis of consistency in personality over ontogeny, almost no research has been done on this topic. Using the lake frog (Rana ridibunda) as a study organism, we tested whether individual-level differences in personality (activity, exploration and boldness) were consistent within both larval and juvenile frog life-history stages and across metamorphosis. We found that most behaviors of interest were highly consistent within a given life-history stage and at least some traits were consistent across metamorphosis (e. g., activity and exploration). Generally, more active, exploratory individuals in novel experimental arenas were also bolder and more likely to spend time in more risky open areas of a familiar environment. To our knowledge, our study is the first to both characterize personality traits across anuran development and provide evidence of consistency in behavior across metamorphosis in a vertebrate species."

However, consistent individual differences in behaviour (personality), such as in risk-taking, might affect an individual's ability to find food, avoid predators and adjust to new conditions. It is now well known that personalities exist in many taxa, but much less is known about individual variation in plasticity. We measured the tendency to begin foraging across different levels of risk in house sparrows (Passer domesticus), using a behavioural reaction norm framework to simultaneously assess personality and plasticity. We asked whether individuals were consistently different across risk levels, and whether they differed in habituation and neophobia, both of which were treated as cases of plasticity. We found that males habituated more than females by beginning to feed sooner after repeated instances of a human disturbance in the presence of an initially unfamiliar object. Individuals of both sexes also exhibited consistent differences across trials, but did not differ in the rate of habituation beyond the difference between the sexes. When a novel object was placed in the foraging area, both sexes exhibited similar degrees of neophobia by delaying feeding. The magnitude of this change varied among birds, indicating individual differences in neophobia. Our results indicate that both personality and individual variation in plasticity exist but should be treated as independent phenomena. The presence of variation in plasticity implies that the raw material necessary for selection on neophobia exists, and that if heritable, plasticity in risk-taking across contexts could evolve."

The decisions where to settle and how far to travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g. specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set. Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Juvenile exposure to environmental cues such as conspecific signalling or predator cues may provide relevant information regarding the make-up of the forthcoming environment. Individuals might be able to use these cues to adjust developmental trajectory and adult personality to prevent a personality-environment mismatch. Using the field cricket Gryllus integer, we show that individuals reared in the presence of conspecific acoustic sexual signals alter both growth rate and an adult personality trait. Males reared in the presence of acoustic sexual signals were less aggressive and less likely to become dominant relative to those reared in the absence of acoustic signals. Additionally, acoustic treatment interacted with juvenile body mass: large juveniles reared in the presence of acoustic signals were larger than small juveniles reared in the presence of acoustic signals and larger than all juveniles reared in silence. We discuss the potential adaptive significance of the observed developmental and personality differences. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Aggressive propensity is usually an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates) according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social contexts, especially in highly social species.

We assessed the utility of one proposed framework while studying personality in terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita clypeatus). We recorded the latency of individuals to emerge from their shells over multiple trials in four unique manipulations. We used the specific testing situations within these manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods, and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

We performed two experimental sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that, overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were repeatable in the long term. We found interindividual differences in short-term stability of exploratory tendencies, but not struggling rate, providing evidence for differences in intraindividual variability. In the long term, struggling rate significantly decreased between the two experimental sessions, whereas exploratory tendencies remained stable. Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both sessions did not differ. Our results suggest that short- and long-term repeatability and stability of personality may vary between individuals, depending on the behavioural trait under scrutiny. As a consequence, deducing personality from measures realized earlier in a subject's life should be performed with caution.

However, up to now, very few studies have looked whether colour morphs just differ in average behaviour or whether specific combinations of behaviours are favoured in relation to a particular morph therefore signalling personality traits. This was tested in the highly social and polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae). Tests were performed in pairs of a red-headed and a black-headed individual of same sex and size but different age. Capture rank in the aviary as well as latency to feed beside a novel object (neophobia) and to approach and touch a novel object on a perch (neophilia) were measured. For neophobia and neophilia, ranks of latencies calculated across all individuals were used and general and within-pair comparisons were made. Neophobia and approach neophilia were consistent over time (2 similar to mo), and approach neophilia was positively correlated with capture rank and neophobia indicating that the behaviours are part of personality traits. Moreover, black-headed birds generally approached the novel object earlier than red-headed birds. Similarly, within pairs, black-headed birds were first to approach the novel object and were also captured first. Relative age (younger or older than the partner) was related to neophobia and tactile neophilia ranks; older birds reacted faster. The results indicate that colour morphs not only differ in average behaviour but that specific combinations of behaviours are related to colour morphs suggesting that head colours signal personality traits.

These assays should be correlated if they all reflect boldness, but this assumption has rarely been tested. We investigated experimentally whether presentation of threatening stimuli (a taxidermic puff adder, Bitis arietans arietans) and novel object (an unfamiliar food item) both assayed the same personality trait in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We recorded individual responses to both the snake model and novel foods for 57 baboons encompassing all age-sex classes in two study troops over 3 years. Surprisingly, those individuals that showed the greatest alarm responses to the model snake, that is, the least bold responses, also inspected it for longer. Furthermore, individuals' threat responses did not correlate with their response to the novel food. Thus, boldness according to one definition was not related to boldness using another definition. We suggest that threat-directed behaviours did not reflect individual boldness, but instead were indicative of another personality dimension: anxiety. These findings highlight that current boldness assays may not be interchangeable, and in some cases may not measure boldness at all. We stress the value of using multiple assays to measure the personality trait of interest. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Colonies differed consistently, across foraging and disturbance situations, in both responsiveness and speed. Increased activity in response to food was associated with a smaller decrease in response to alarm. Speed of retrieving food was correlated with speed of removing debris.

However, studies of animal personality suggest that behaviour can be `constrained' to certain behavioural types, leading to consistent differences between individuals. Few studies have investigated the interaction between personality traits and the need for flexibility in individuals over different, naturally occurring situations in the wild. We investigated whether free-living Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, were constrained by personality types or showed behavioural plasticity when their environmental conditions changed dramatically between the dry and rainy seasons. We examined three key behaviours: risk taking as measured by flight initiation distance, time budgets focusing on time spent conspicuous and rates of signalling directed at conspecifics. Risk-taking behaviour of males showed stable between-individual differences, but no between-individual differences in plasticity, supporting previous evidence that antipredator behaviour is determined by personality in this species. Time spent conspicuous showed a response to season, and an interaction between the individual and season, suggesting that behavioural plasticity itself may be a personality trait. In contrast, signalling behaviour changed in response to season but did not vary consistently between individuals. We suggest that where there are reliable environmental cues, individual plasticity will be favoured over consistency in the relevant behaviours.

Interspecific comparisons have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part, to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity. We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future studies."

Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour, which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations. Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity, exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age. Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off between current and future reproduction might maintain personality variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this life-history trade-off hypothesis."

We conducted a study with a herd of young rangeland-raised cows to determine whether animals exhibited consistent differences in foraging behaviours across contexts (confinement vs. rangeland pasture) and could be clustered into behavioural type groups on the basis of a suite of correlated behaviours. We also investigated whether cows with different behavioural types performed differently in this environment. Supplement consumption rate (SCR) in confinement was used to select two groups of cows (fast eaters vs. slow eaters). This classification was validated by measuring the persistence of SCR differences through time, conducting cluster analysis to classify individuals into two behavioural types (BT1 and BT2) on the basis of a suite of 14 behavioural, physiological, and performance predictors, and comparing serum cortisol concentrations of cows in either group. Discriminant and linear correlation analyses were used to assess the influence of behavioural and performance responses on the classification of cows, and to study the relationships between behaviour and animal performance. Thirty-three young cows were tracked with GPS collars for approximately 45 days during the calving seasons 01 2006 and 2007 and several performance responses were measured on each individual. Cows classified as exhibiting BT1 had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) SCR (mean +/- SE 2006: 1.90 +/- 0.1; 2007: 2.54 +/- 0.1 g/s) and serum cortisol (SC) concentrations (8.8 +/- 0.88 ng/mL) than BT2 counterparts (SCR 2006: 0.32 +/- 0.03 g/s; SCR 2007: 1.59 +/- 0.1 g/s; SC: 5.5 +/- 0.5 ng/mL). Compared to BT2 cows, BT1 individuals tended to spend less time at water (BT1 : 73 +/- 10; BT2: 172 +/- 16 min/day), cover larger areas (BT1, : 21 +/- 0.3; BT2: 17 +/- 2 ha/day), and exhibit less concentrated search patterns (BT1: 264 +/- 8.9; BT2: 314 +/- 2 Gm travelled/(ha covered/day)).

The exploratory behaviour of species or populations depends on different aspects of their ecology. New evidence suggests that differences in exploratory behaviour might also be related to life history strategies, with fast-lived animals (high metabolic rate, short life span) being faster explorers than slow-lived ones. We tested this assumption in shrews. Shrews are divided into two phylogenetic groups, which differ tremendously in life history. We compared the exploratory behaviour of three species, covering both phylogenetic groups. Shrews of the fast-lived genus Sorex were quicker to start exploration and to locate the first food patch. They also moved faster than the slow-lived genus Crocidura. Unlike many studies on exploratory behaviour that analyse only a short period of time (i.e. a single exploration bout with a fixed duration), we analysed the species-specific allocation of prolonged total exploration time into exploration bouts. Using this method, we could show that Sorex performed more, but shorter exploration bouts than Crocidura. Our results support the hypothesis of exploratory behaviour being related to life history. While the species we tested occur sympatrically, the two genera differ strongly in the climatic zones they inhabit. It is likely that also during evolution they faced different types of habitat and thus different selection pressures. These differences in evolutionary histories possibly favoured the evolution of their diversified life histories and exploration strategies. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

As individuals can face different situations over their lives, and their life history expectation may not be the same in different life stages, one can expect that using different strategies in different life stages would be advantageous. Characteristics of animal personality across ontogeny could be measured at group and individual levels. Since personality alteration across time can be studied from various aspects one should use the following indexes: mean-level, differential, structural and individual consistency. We investigated whether common firebugs behave in the same way through a major life stage transition, namely final ecdysis. We measured activity, boldness and exploration twice in the larval stage and also twice when bugs reached the adult stage. We found that the relative value of behavioural traits was stable across ontogeny and the correlation structure among behavioural traits remained constant over time. Nevertheless, larvae differed from adults in general in that they were bolder, explored their environment more thoroughly and seemed to be more active before final ecdysis. These results indicate that personality could change differently across major life stage transitions; therefore this important factor needs to be considered in further research.

At a population level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness. We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e. shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However, an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour.

Species differ in mean and variance in FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in FID have individuals that take either small or great risks, whereas species with a small variance are composed of individuals that are homogeneous in their risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the correlations between interspecific variance in risk-taking behavior and habitat selection, breeding range and population size, dispersal, and life history. Greater between individual variation in risk-taking behavior for a given average level of risk taking would imply that more different habitats could be exploited, resulting in larger local and global population sizes and larger ranges. There should be a link between dispersal distances and FID because individuals of risk-averse species should encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable breeding habitats. High local and global population sizes should select for fast life histories with early age at first reproduction, high annual fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of senescence in species with variable FIDs. Finally, a greater diversity of habitat use should select for a longer reproductive season in species with more variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of birds revealed results largely consistent with these predictions. Because risk taking correlates with other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome behavioral syndromes can play an important role in producing ecological syndromes (i.e., correlations between ecological traits)."

When behaviours are correlated across multiple functional behavioural categories or `contexts', `behavioural syndromes' are said to be present. It is possible, however, that behavioural syndromes may also show consistencies. Here we investigated the presence of behavioural syndromes linking startle responses, exploration and aggression in hermit crabs and assessed their stability across two situations (low versus high predation risk). Correlation analyses detected behavioural syndromes between startle responses, a measure of `boldness', and the latency to investigate a novel object, as well as the latency to attack an opponent in an aggressive context. The startle response-investigation and startle response-aggression syndromes were stable between situations, whilst there was a lack of relationship between investigation and aggression in each situation. Here we propose that these consistent individual differences in the expression of behavioural syndromes reveal the presence of animal personality, manifesting in not just one, but a suite of interacting traits."

Although intracolonial behavioural variation is an important component of division of labour, and as such a key feature for the success of societies, empirical links between behavioural variation and fitness are scarce. We investigated aggression, exploration and brood care behaviour in Temnothorax longispinosus ant colonies. We focused on two distinct aspects: intercolonial variability and its consistency across time and contexts, and intracolonial variability and its influence on productivity. Aggressiveness was consistent over four to five months with a new generation of workers emerging in between trial series. Other behaviours were not consistent over time. Exploration of novel environments responded to the sequence of assays: colonies were faster in discovering when workers previously encountered opponents in aggression experiments. Suites of correlated behaviours (e. g. aggression-exploration syndrome) present in the first series did not persist over time. Finally, colonies with more intracolonial behavioural variation in brood care and exploration of novel objects were more productive under standardized conditions than colonies with less variation."

Critics have argued that this similarity derives from anthropomorphic projection or other rater-based effects. We developed two forms of data reduction analyses to determine whether these dimensions can best be explained by the inherent tendencies of the animals (e.g. orang-utans that are curious are playful) or anthropomorphic projections of raters (e.g. believing that orang-utans that are curious should be playful). We found that personality dimensions derived after differences between rater means and rater{*}item interactions had been removed from ratings replicated the previously discovered dimensions. Conversely, we found a different set of dimensions when analysing items from which differences between animal means and animal{*}item interactions had been removed. Finally, we used multilevel factor analysis to examine whether the published structure was replicated when we extracted factors based on the within-level animal differences in item scores effects while allowing between-rater differences to covary freely. Again, the personality dimensions were similar to those described in previous studies. These analyses can be used in combination with interrater reliability, temporal stability, and correlations between personality and other external variables to validate animal personality ratings. These analyses confirmed that personality similarities between humans and great apes are best explained by genetic and phylogenetic affinity and not by anthropomorphic artefacts.

In non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression may be influenced by ecology, mating system and sexual selection. While most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigate the possibility that stable between-individual differences in startle-response durations influence fighting ability or `resource-holding potential' (RHP) in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina. Both winners and losers showed significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual losers than for eventual winners, indicating that RHP varies with boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses inflicted more attacks on their opponent. Both repeatability and mean-level responses were changed by the experience of fighting, and these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was disrupted to a greater extent and the mean startle-response durations were subject to a greater increase than in winners. Thus, following a fight, this behavioural correlate of RHP behaves in a way similar to post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between winners and losers. Understanding the links between aggression and boldness therefore has the potential to enhance our understanding of both the evolution of animal personality and the `winner and loser effects' of post-fight changes in RHP."

The reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis, however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk. Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10 m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments. This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population, and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play important roles in the evolution of personality."

Adaptation to urban life involves changes in various traits, including behavior. Behavioral traits often vary consistently among individuals, and these so-called personality traits can be correlated with each other, forming behavioral syndromes. Despite their adaptive significance and potential to act as constraints, little is known about the role of animal personality and behavioral syndromes in animals' adaptation to urban habitats. In this study we tested whether differently urbanized habitats select for different personalities and behavioral syndromes by altering the population mean, inter-individual variability, and correlations of personality traits. We captured house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from four different populations along the gradient of urbanization and assessed their behavior in standardized test situations. We found individual consistency in neophobia, risk taking, and activity, constituting three personality axes. On the one hand, urbanization did not consistently affect the mean and variance of these traits, although there were significant differences between some of the populations in food neophobia and risk taking (both in means and variances). On the other hand, both urban and rural birds exhibited a behavioral syndrome including object neophobia, risk taking and activity, whereas food neophobia was part of the syndrome only in rural birds. These results indicate that there are population differences in certain aspects of personality in house sparrows, some of which may be related to habitat urbanization. Our findings suggest that urbanization and/or other population-level habitat differences may not only influence the expression of personality traits but also alter their inter-individual variability and the relationships among them, changing the structure of behavioral syndromes."

Different antipredator strategies can coexist within a population if each strategy is the result of a trade-off with competing demands. Antipredator behavior can be associated with morphological traits, like color patterns, either because in the context of sexual selection, coloration signals the ability to avoid predators or because coloration is a naturally selected trait useful in avoiding predators. Because in the barn owl (Tyto alba), heritable eumelanic plumage coloration is associated with the glucocorticoid-dependent response to stress, we tested whether antipredator behavior is also related to this trait. Compared with small-spotted nestlings, individuals displaying larger black spots hissed more intensely in the presence of humans, feigned death longer, had a lower breathing rate under stress, and were more docile when handled. Cross-fostering experiments showed that the covariation between the spot size and the duration of feigning death was inherited from the biological mother, whereas covariation between spot size and docility was inherited from the biological father. Our results confirm that melanin-based coloration is associated with suites of behavioral traits, which are under both genetic and environmental influence. Coloration can thus evolve as a direct or indirect response to predation, but it can also be a signal of antipredator strategies to potential mates."

As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2 components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator models) or is simply related to variation in general activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast, our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition, we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more widely used."

Consequently, there is much interest in the forces driving and maintaining various syndromes. Individual host behaviours have been associated with susceptibility to parasitism, yet the role of pre-existing personality types in acquiring infections has not been investigated experimentally. Using a larval amphibian-trematode parasite model system, we report that tadpoles generally showed consistency in their activity level in response to both novel food and parasite exposure. Not only were individual activity level and exploration in the novel food context correlated with each other and with anti-parasite behaviour, all three were significant predictors of host parasite load. This is the first empirical demonstration that host behaviours in other contexts are related to behaviours mitigating infection risk and, ultimately, host parasite load. We suggest that this system illustrates how reliably high levels of activity and exploratory behaviour in different contexts might maximize both energy acquisition and resistance to trematode parasites. Such benefits could drive selection for the behavioural syndrome seen here owing to the life histories and ecological circumstances typical of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) larvae."

There was no significant association between pigmentation and lice at other developmental stages, suggesting that host factors associated with melanin-based pigmentation may modify ectoparasite development to a larger degree than settlement. In a subsequent laboratory experiment a strong negative correlation between skin spots and post-stress cortisol levels was revealed, with less pigmented individuals showing a more pronounced cortisol response to acute stress. The observation that lice prevalence was strongly increased on a fraction of sexually mature male salmon which occurred among the farmed fish further supports a role for steroid hormones as mediators of reduced parasite resistance. The data presented here propose steroid hormones as a proximate cause for the association between melanin-based pigmentation and parasites. Possible fundamental and applied implications are discussed."

Male Siamese fighting fish exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously. However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days."

However, there is some concern that studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting.

We recorded the risk management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals. These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior. Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity, suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context, potentially removing these differences."

Coping with changes in cues that are associated with the location and abundance of food is essential for being able to adjust behaviourally to a variable environment. The use of cues in decision making requires appropriate levels of attention and learning ability, which may be affected by the personality of an individual. The relationship between personality, attention and learning as essential mechanisms for behavioural adaptation, however, is not well understood. We studied the relationship between attention to environmental cues, behavioural flexibility in learning and exploratory behaviour, a proxy for personality, in great tits, Parus major. We used a dimensional shift learning paradigm; a learning task involving several stages differing in complexity and requiring attention to changes in relevant cues. The results show personality differences in performance in learning flexibility in only the apparently most difficult stage, yet in opposite directions for males and females. Fast-exploring males showed more flexible learning abilities than slow males, whereas in females slow explorers outperformed fast explorers. These context-dependent and sex-specific personality effects reveal behavioural and cognitive mechanisms that may underlie observed sex-and personality-dependent fitness differences in natural populations.

For example, certain individuals may demonstrate consistently greater behavioural reactions and elevated stress responses. We conducted playback experiments and hormonal analyses on male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in captivity to investigate the patterns and proximate mediators of individual variations in behavioural reactions. We found intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation in behavioural reactions (intensive vigilance towards the direction of speakers) to vocalisations by unfamiliar chimpanzees. This behavioural reaction was positively correlated with changes in salivary cortisol concentration, suggesting that stress is a proximate factor mediating the variation in behavioural reactions. The males who were highly responsive to the conspecific vocalisation also exhibited high behavioural reactions towards the neutral broadcast stimulus (the jungle crows Corvus macrorhynchos ka vocalisation). This observation is consistent with the notion that male chimpanzees vary in intrinsic behavioural tendency to different stimuli."

In most animals, juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets, adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets. Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when they were nymphs, versus when they were adults."

Parasitism and immune challenges are hypothesized to shape the expression of animal personality traits, but few studies have examined the influence of neonatal immune status on the development of adult personality. We examined how non-pathogenic immune challenges, administered at different stages of development, affected two common measures of personality, activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as colour-dependent novel object exploration in adult male mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that individuals that were immune-challenged during the middle (immediately following the completion of somatic growth) and late (during the acquisition of nuptial plumage) stages of development were more active in novel environments as adults relative to developmentally unchallenged birds or those challenged at an earlier developmental time point. Additionally, individuals challenged during the middle stage of development preferred orange and avoided red objects more than those that were not immune-challenged during development. Our results demonstrate that, in accordance with our predictions, early-life immune system perturbations alter the expression of personality traits later in life, emphasizing the role that developmental plasticity plays in shaping adult personality, and lending support to recent theoretical models that suggest that parasite pressure may play an important role in animal personality development."

However, the proximate causes (or mechanisms) that underlie the clustering of behaviour are not well understood. In this review, we examine the proximate causes of the aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, which constitutes a positive correlation between aggression, boldness and exploratory activity. In particular, we will focus on novel insights that have been gained from zebrafish, a genetically tractable behavioural model which can be used to study the mechanistic basis of behaviour. Studies of the proximate causes of behavioural syndromes provide us with the opportunity to understand the clustering of behaviours - and perhaps even the basis of personality - at the molecular level. Thus, this exciting field not only promises to bring novel insights into animal behaviour, but also forces us to rethink our own personalities as well."

Only seven articles investigated the issue in a handful of species among hermit crabs, crabs, and crayfish. Obviously, a limited number of publications does not mean that personality is rare in decapods. On the contrary, few studies might be the result of a form of reluctance by behavioral ecologists to deal with such a phenomenon in these and other invertebrates. This reluctance contrasts with the enthusiasm shown in tackling the behavioral plasticity issue. Here we discuss the possible theoretical and methodological difficulties raised by applying the animal personality perspective to decapods and analyze implications of personality studies for their ecology, conservation, and welfare.

Because the behavior of social insect colonies emerges from the actions of their workers, individual variation among workers' personality may be important in determining the variation we observe among colonies. The reproductive unit of social insects, on which natural selection acts, is the colony, not individual workers. Therefore, it is important to understand what mechanisms govern the observed variation among colonies. Here I propose three hypotheses that address how consistent individual differences in the behavior of workers may lead to consistent individual differences in the behavior of colonies: 1. Colonies differ consistently in their average of worker personality; 2. The distribution but not the average of worker personalities varies consistently among colonies; and 3. Colony personality does not emerge from its worker personality composition but from consistent external constraints. I review evidence supporting each of these hypotheses and suggest methods to further investigate them. The study of how colony personality emerges from the personalities of the workers comprising them may shed light on the mechanisms underlying consistent individual differences in the behavior of other animals [}Current Zoology 58 (4): 580-588, 2012]."

The influence of parasitism on host behaviour, although well-documented, is only now being examined in a multi-trait context, and behavioural syndromes provide a framework for such investigations. We test the hypothesis that parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the relationship between infection by four trematode species and the correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue. Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis, Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the association depending on the behaviour tested. These findings suggest that behavioural syndromes may not only be targets for adaptive host manipulation by parasites, but also that, even if through mere pathology, parasites could act as external agents generating variation in behavioural syndromes."

This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types, including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials. Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant association between the tendency to guard and morphological and physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the product of prevailing environmental and social conditions."

Exploration syndromes, by affecting prospecting behaviour, dispersal and public information use may also contribute to our understanding of coloniality. This study aims at investigating whether an exploration syndrome exists in a colonial fish species, Neolamprologus caudopunctatus. Individuals of this species were subjected to two consecutive tests, a novel environment and a novel object test. Results show that more explorative individuals in a novel environment are also less neophobic in the presence of a novel object, suggesting that the tendency to engage with novelty per se is a consistent trait and part of an exploration syndrome.

However, two of these methods, personality ratings and experimentation, have been little compared in captivity and never compared in the wild. We assessed the boldness of wild chacma baboons Papio ursinus using both ratings and experimental methods. Boldness was experimentally assessed when individuals were presented with a novel food item during natural foraging. The boldness of the same individuals was rated on a five-point scale by experienced observers. The ratings and experimental assessments of boldness were found to correlate positively and in a linear fashion. When considered categorically the two approaches showed variable agreement depending on the number of categories assigned and the cutoff criteria adopted. We suggest that the variation between approaches arises because each method captures different aspects of personality; ratings consider personality in absolute terms (using predefined criteria) and multiple contexts, while experimental assessments consider personality in relative terms (using experimental scores relative to the population average) and in limited contexts. We encourage animal personality researchers to consider adopting both methodologies in future studies. We also propose that future studies restrict their analyses to continuous data, since the greatest comparability between methods was found with these data. However, if individuals must be categorised, we suggest that researchers either (a) analyse only those individuals categorised as bold or shy by both ratings and experimental approaches or, if these methods cannot be employed simultaneously, (b) do not use approach-specific criteria but choose a cut-off that can be compared by both approaches."

The individual quality hypothesis proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated, because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as a random effect, we found that consistent differences between individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of each are context dependent.

However, the personality of an individual could also have a strong influence on the decisions of other individuals, in situations such as selecting or avoiding a social companion or a mate. Under this scenario, indicators of different personalities would have evolved, but the possible signalling of personality has received little consideration to date. We hypothesized that birds can signal their personality through feather coloration and tested this hypothesis in siskins relating different colour patches to their exploration score. To measure exploration, we presented the siskins with a novel object and calculated how long they took to approach it. We found that siskins with larger black bibs showed shorter approach latencies. This finding supports the idea that plumage coloration traits can provide information about personality traits of the bearer. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

A pivotal question in animal personality research concerns the mechanism(s) responsible for its evolution and maintenance. Negative frequency-dependent selection is considered to be one of these important mechanisms, although evidence for this is largely absent. Here, we studied whether the feeding performance of barnacle geese was negative frequency-dependent in a producer-scrounger game. We studied the feeding time of one bold or one shy individual in groups consisting of only bold or shy companions to study if the rare type in the group performs best. A previous study with this species showed that scrounging increased with shyness. Hence, we expected shy individuals to do better in the presence of bold companions due to the increased scrounging opportunity and bold individuals to do better in the presence of shy companions as there were ample opportunities to produce food. We found no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success; rather, we found that, independent of their boldness score, all individuals enjoyed higher feeding success when foraging with bold than with shy companions. The higher foraging success of individuals foraging with bold companions is explained by a higher joining proportion in the presence of bold companions. Our results provide no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding success in barnacle geese but indicate that both bold and shy individuals can increase their foraging returns by associating with bold individuals."

When this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95\% confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature showed that only about 5\% of articles explicitly mentioned heteroscedasticity, leaving 95\% of articles in which heteroscedasticity was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally, we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an important source of additional information about the particular biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to statistical analysis."

Comparative studies on teleost fishes support the existence of coping styles and behavioral syndromes also in poikilothermic animals. The functionalist approach to emotions hold that emotions have evolved to ensure appropriate behavioral responses to dangerous or rewarding stimuli. Little information is however available on how evolutionary widespread these putative links between personality and the expression of emotional or affective states such as fear are. Here we disclose that individual variation in coping style predicts fear responses in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, using the principle of avoidance learning. Fish previously screened for coping style were given the possibility to escape a signalled aversive stimulus. Fearful individuals showed a range of typically reactive traits such as slow recovery of feed intake in a novel environment, neophobia, and high post-stress cortisol levels. Hence, emotional reactivity and appraisal would appear to be an essential component of animal personality in species distributed throughout the vertebrate subphylum."

However, less clear is how this might affect individuals in cooperatively breeding species, where subordinates assist dominants in raising offspring, and growth has profound life-history and social consequences. Here, we examined the effects of behavioral type on growth rates and feeding in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher, comparing growth rates of individuals settled inside a group (dominant or subordinate) or unsettled fish (aggregation) of different behavioral types (bold-shy continuum) under a feeding regime where food could not be monopolized. Controlling for other factors, we found no effect of the behavioral type on the growth rates of dominants and subordinates in either sex. In contrast, bold female aggregation fish were significantly growing faster in length compared with shy female aggregation fish, whereas no such effect was detected in male aggregation fish. These growth rate differences were largely matched by differences in feeding rates, but locomotion appeared more important in determining growth than feeding rate. Our results show that differences in social status may need to be taken into account when testing for correlations between behavioral type and growth in vertebrates, and cautions that growth adjustments may get obscured due to correlated changes in other costly behaviors, like locomotion."

Such `personality' affects fitness and has therefore become an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability', `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a broad range of social and non-social behaviours. The study highlights the importance of assessing personality in the social behaviour, especially in cohesive social species, as only then can we understand the consequences of personality in socially living species."

The extent of this asymmetry should depend on the relative costs and benefits of care. Individual variation in personality is likely to influence this trade-off, and hence is a promising candidate to explain differences in care. In addition, plasticity in parental care may also be associated with personality differences. Using exploration behaviour (EB) as a measure of personality, we investigated these possibilities using both natural and experimental data from a wild population of great tits (Parus major). Contrary to predictions, we found no association between EB and natural variation in provisioning behaviour. Nor was EB linked to responsiveness to experimentally increased brood demand. These results are initially surprising given substantial data from other studies suggesting personality should influence investment in parental care. However, they are consistent with a recent study showing selection on EB is weak and highly context-specific in the focal population. This emphasises the difficulty faced by personality studies attempting to make predictions based on previous work, given that personalities often vary among populations of the same species."

Personality studies are important because, if personality traits extend their influence across a wide range of situations, they may help to explain the paradoxical occurrence of nonoptimal behaviours. A paradigmatic example of nonoptimal behaviour is the striking lack of behavioural defences of some hosts of obligate avian brood parasites despite the evident costs they incur. Here we propose that the interplay between personality features expressed by hosts outside the nest and the specialized behaviours expressed by hosts in/or near the nests to deter avian brood parasites (i.e. nest defence, egg and nestling recognition and ejection) may affect the average level of host behavioural defences exhibited at the population level as well as the evolutionary dynamics of brood parasiteehost interactions. Differences in personality between hosts may relate to the observed variation in susceptibility to brood parasitism in a given population, as well as to the set of host defensive behaviours expressed in/or near the nests to prevent the costs of brood parasites. In addition, differences in parasite density might have different consequences for the fitness of different personality traits and might potentially explain intermediate tolerance to parasitism and even acceptance of parasitic eggs by hosts in populations exposed to low selection pressures by brood parasites. Future research should thus aim to identify how the different personality traits may relate to specialized host defences to explain the occurrence of apparent maladaptive host behaviours.

We utilized 20 genotypes to examine BT plasticity (boldness and exploration), the development of behavioural correlations, and relationships between life history strategy and BTs at five age points during ontogeny. We found that BT scores increased during early ontogeny and reached an asymptote near sexual maturity. We also found considerable variation in BT developmental plasticity at the genotype level. Moreover, although genotypes exhibited high levels of plasticity in BTs, strong, significant positive correlations between exploration and boldness emerged from day 61 onwards. Furthermore, we observed no difference between genotypes in growth rate and growth was unrelated to BTs. Contrary to our predictions, we found that while genotypes differed in their age at first reproduction and reproductive output, these differences were unrelated to BT expression prior to and following sexual maturity. We discuss these results in relation to mechanisms proposed to drive interindividual variation in BTs and we highlight the potential of the mangrove killifish as a model organism for animal personality studies.

Here, we present evidence suggesting that sexual selection may act on such personality differences in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), as females seem to choose males on the basis of their exploratory behaviour per se, while taking into account their own personality. After observing a pair of males, whose apparent levels of exploration were experimentally manipulated, females that exhibited low-exploratory tendencies showed no preference during mate choice for males that had appeared to be either `exploratory' or `unexploratory'. In contrast, intermediate and highly exploratory females preferred apparently exploratory males over apparently unexploratory ones. Our results suggest that behavioural or genetic compatibility for personality traits might be important for mate choice, at least for exploratory individuals."

Although several different methods have been developed to assess sexual preference in some standardized way, the most commonly used procedure consists of recording female spatial association with different males presented simultaneously. Sexual preference is then inferred from time spent in front of each male. However, the extent to which the measurement of female mate-choice is related to exploration tendencies has not been addressed so far. In the present study we assessed the influence of variation in exploration tendencies, a trait closely associated to global personality, on the measurement of female mating preference in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) using the widely used four-chamber choice-apparatus. The number of movements performed within both exploration and mate-choice apparatus was consistent within and across the two contexts. In addition, personality explained variation in selectivity, preference strength and consistency. High-exploratory females showed lower selectivity, lower preference scores and displayed more consistent preference scores. Our results suggest that variation in personality may affect the measurement of female mating preference and may contribute to explain existing inconsistencies across studies."

All these traits can be involved in the ontogeny of behavioral phenotypes, and therefore, we wanted to know whether features such as early growth also show long-term correlations with the animals' behavioral responses to challenges around maturity. We collected data on the early postnatal development of individually marked European rabbits living in a field enclosure and conducted 2 standardized behavioral tests shortly before the animals matured. In small enclosures, we experimentally tested their behavioral responses 1) in this novel environment and 2) to the confrontation with predator odor. Animals, which were more exploratory during the novel environment test, showed lower behavioral signs of anxiety during the predator test. Both responses were correlated with individual pup body mass, with subjects with higher body mass being more exploratory in the first test and showing lower levels of anxiety in the second. The animals' current body mass or age when being tested were not correlated with any of their responses. First, the correlated responses of the animals during the different contexts of the applied tests strongly suggest the existence of behavioral phenotypes in European rabbits. Second, and most importantly, our study provides evidence that an animal's early development can exert long-term effects on its personality type, although it is not clear whether body mass per se or some correlated physiological features drive the observed relationships."

Nine female migratory trout were each crossed with one migratory and one resident male and the offspring were raised in hatchery tanks until first feeding. The behavioural studies showed that fry that responded bold towards a novel object also accepted a novel food item earlier and responded more aggressively towards their own mirror image. Principal component analysis showed that this shyness-boldness syndrome (PC1) explained 34\% of the behavioural variation. Offspring boldness was not affected by paternal migratory life history, but significant effects of the female parent suggested maternal and/or genetic effects. Deviations from this pattern (PC2), where some individuals behaved less aggressively and performed more approaches to food, explained an additional 17\% of the variation in behaviour, and was significantly influenced by length and paternal migratory life history. Fry growth and survival in nature was not associated with boldness (PC1) or PC2, suggesting that alternative behavioural strategies can be successful in nature. However, female parent effects on variation in fry size persisted over the first growth period in the wild, suggesting that these effects may influence offspring fitness during early life when major selection occurs."

Behavioral studies on rats usually concentrate on a single trait without considering how different behaviors are linked to each other and whether there are differences in this respect between rat strains or sexes. This study aims to describe the personality structure of the Norway rat, and investigate if the structure of personality varies between sexes or populations, using owner assessments of pet rats. Rat owners from three countries filled out a questionnaire which was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The data were divided between the sexes and populations, resulting in six groups. Preliminary exploratory factor analysis was first conducted on the most numerous group to form a hypothesis about the personality structure, after which confirmatory factor analysis was used to discover differences between groups. A three factor model consisting of the components activity, tameness and anxiousness fit all groups. Both quantitative and qualitative differences were found between sexes, especially with respect to the trait activity. If neglected, the sex differences compromise the generality and reliability of behavioral research on rats. Population differences were negligible. The results underline the importance of considering the sex of the animal as well as its individual characteristics when assessing its wellbeing, behavioral requirements or suitability for a certain task or research experiment. Using a method adopted from human personality research produced meaningful results consistent with previous reports on rodent personality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It is usually assumed that such consistent individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat. Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A. equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in species with simple nervous systems."

In contrast to human personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult. Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male. Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects of the early environment.

Recent studies have revealed that within-species variation in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) can shed light on the invasion process. The general hypothesis is that individuals' personality type may affect their colonization success, suggesting that some individuals might be better invaders than others. We have recently shown that, in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), social personality trait was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial individuals dispersing further. Here, we tested how mean personality within a population, in addition to individual personality type, affect dispersal and settlement decisions in the mosquitofish. We found that individual dispersal tendencies were influenced by the population's mean boldness and sociability score. For example, individuals from populations with more asocial individuals or with more bold individuals are more likely to disperse regardless of their own personality type. We suggest that identifying behavioural traits facilitating invasions, even at the group level, can thus have direct applications in pest management."

Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between males as well as greater variation between trials for individual females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and females.

Despite the new-found interest in animal personality among behavioural ecologists, few studies have investigated the link between personality traits and fitness measures. We examined this link using male rainbowfish, Melanotaenia duboulayi, as a model species and found that a range of personality traits (aggression, activity and boldness) covaried with a male's position in a hierarchy, which is directly related to reproductive success in this and many other species. Dominant fish were more aggressive, active, bold and also significantly larger than subordinate fish. Moreover, we found strong correlations between activity levels and boldness suggesting that selection may act on a suite of traits in concert (sensu behavioural syndromes). When taken together with previous research, our results suggest that the activity-boldness syndrome is likely to be domain specific. We suggest that multiple trait correlations may be generated by high levels of competition (e. g. sexual selection) in addition to predation pressure as identified by previous studies.

This compensatory growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet, compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2 consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative strategies in different environmental conditions.

We predicted that the presence of conspecific companions should result in focal birds reacting to novelty by exploring more extensively because the companion birds contribute to anti-predator vigilance behaviour and because social isolation often causes behavioural inhibition in social species. We found that exploratory behaviour of focal individuals was significantly reduced in the presence of conspecific companions, irrespective of the companion's sex. Moreover, we found a weak trend towards females being more exploratory than males, irrespective of the social context.

Consistent individual differences in these behaviours (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow' exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels. Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms and the phenotypic traits.

In the temperate social spider, Anelosimus studiosus, colony members exhibit a behavioural polymorphism; females either exhibit an aggressive `asocial' or docile `social' phenotype. We assessed individual prey-capture success for both phenotypes, and the role of phenotypic composition on group-level prey-capture success for three prey size classes. We then estimated the effect of group phenotypic composition on fitness in a common garden, as inferred from individual egg-case masses. On average, asocial females were more successful than social females at capturing large prey, and colony-level prey-capture success was positively associated with the frequency of the asocial phenotype. Asocial colony members were also more likely to engage in prey-capture behaviour in group-foraging situations. Interestingly, our fitness estimates indicate females of both phenotypes experience increased fitness when occupying colonies containing unlike individuals. These results imply a reciprocal fitness benefit of within-colony behavioural variation, and perhaps division of labour in a spider society."

Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts. These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two different social foraging games: producer-scrounger (PS) and patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC trials.

Individual variation in circulating levels of testosterone (T) is often hypothesized to underpin personality traits such as aggressiveness and exploratory behaviour. Here we provide a comprehensive test of this hypothesis. We quantified variation in exploratory behaviour of a novel environment in a captive population of wild-caught male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then investigated the relationship between the observed behaviours and circulating levels of T, using two approaches. First, we tested whether measures of exploratory behaviour correlated with (1) point-sampled plasma T levels and (2) T-dependent ornamentation (bill coloration) in 114 males. Neither direct nor indirect estimates of individual variation in T levels were correlated with the assayed behaviours. Second, we experimentally increased plasma T levels of 21 males with T implants, using 21 placebo-implanted males as a control group. Experimentally induced between-individual variation in T levels did not increase the amount of between-individual variation in exploratory behaviour. Our results thus strongly suggest that, in house sparrows, between-individual variation in circulating levels of T cannot serve as a causal explanation for the existence of individual variation in exploratory behaviour.

Here, we test the effects of temperature on a suite of behavioral traits in the spider Anelosimus studiosus to determine (1) whether there are shifts in individuals' social tendency, activity level, and foraging behavior in response to temperature, (2) if these traits shift are in the direction predicted by within-population axes of trait covariance, and (3) whether the effects of temperature differ among individuals. In previous work, we documented a behavioral syndrome in A. studiosus where increased tolerance of conspecifics is correlated with decreased activity level and aggressiveness toward prey. Furthermore, there are distinct among-population differences in behavior, where individuals from warm sites tend to be more aggressive and active than individuals from cold sites. Our data here reveal that at warmer temperatures A. studiosus exhibit diminished tolerance of conspecifics, increased activity levels, shorter latencies of attack, and increased tendencies to attack multiple prey items. Furthermore, we found that individual differences in behavior were consistent across temperature regimes for the majority of behavioral traits considered here: social tendency, activity level, and latency of attack. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these behaviors are linked together by shared genetic underpinnings (e.g., metabolic differences) and shift non-independently in response to contemporary abiotic environment (i.e., temperature). Furthermore, our data suggest that temperature itself could be responsible for the among-population variation in social structure in A. studiosus."

More recently, this field has begun to examine how such variation arose and is maintained within populations. The habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, which posits that animals with differing personality types may fare better (i.e. have a fitness advantage) in different habitats, suggests one possible mechanism. In the current experiment, we tested whether slow-and fast-exploring black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), determined by performance in a novel environment exploration task, perform differentially when the demands of an acoustic operant discrimination (cognitive) task were altered following successful task acquisition. We found that slow-exploring birds learn to reverse previously learned natural category rules more quickly than faster exploring conspecifics. In accordance with the habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, and previous work with great tits (Parus major), a close relative of the black-capped chickadee, our results suggest that fast-exploring birds may perform better in stable, predictable environments where forming a routine is advantageous, while slow-exploring birds are favoured in unstable, unpredictable environments, where task demands often change. Our results also support a hypothesis derived from previous work with great tits; slow-exploring birds may be generally more flexible (i.e. able to modify their behaviour in accordance with changes in environmental stimuli) in some learning tasks."

DHA is an integral component of the brain known to impact cognitive function, and its impact on budgerigar behaviour is previously unstudied. Adult budgerigars (14 females, 9 males) were housed in two home pens and received either a control diet or a diet supplemented with DHA. The birds were tested in seven experimental situations designed to gauge boldness. Behavioural responses within the categories of fear, feeding and activity were recorded as well as immune status. Our results suggest that dietary DHA supplementation had no effects on the behavioural and immune variables measured in this study. The results do suggest that budgerigars have bold-shy personality traits for their activity and feeding behaviours, as indicated by significant correlations between percent of locations in the central area of the open field with activity in the presence of the familiar flock in the tendency to flock test (r(s) = 0.754, N=9, P<0.05), net distance travelled in the open field with activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock in the tendency to flock test (r(s) = -0.812, N=8, P<0.05), activity in the presence of the familiar flock and activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock (r(s) = 0.838, N=10, P<0.05) and the number of seeds eaten alone and the number of seeds eaten in competition, both in the foraging and competition test (r(s) = 0.770, N = 11, P<0.05). Additionally, significant correlations between open field activity variables and fear variables measuring latencies may indicate that activity and fear variables are related. Finally, although there were several significant correlations between immune parameters and behavioural variables, the results were inconsistent with the hypothesis that immune status and personality are related in the budgerigar. In summary, our results indicate that DHA at the levels used had no effects on budgerigar personality or immune status. However, the results do provide evidence to support the hypothesis that budgerigar personality occurs as a bold-shy axis since budgerigars behaved consistently with regard to activity levels and, for males, feeding behaviour. Females showed a higher innate immunity as measured by the bactericidal activity of whole blood, while in males, this parameter was related to feeding behaviour. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite rigorous standardization there is still considerable inter-individual variation in metabolic rates which is often ignored. Furthermore, housing in respirometry chambers implies handling and exposure to a new environment, conditions known to be a source of stress in animals. The extent of stress response is known to be dependent on an individual's coping style. Therefore, the extent of individual variation in respirometry data may be related to the expression of coping styles. The goal of this study is to determine whether the variation in oxygen consumption after a stressor is the resultant of an individual's coping style. Our approach was to determine oxygen consumption in fish immediately after transfer to respiratory chambers and during the subsequent 22 h. In addition, the same individuals were subjected to 3 respirometry runs (22 h each) to address the question whether habituation occurs when fish are used in multiple runs and whether habituation potential is linked to coping styles. The same individuals were then subjected to an acute stressor and the escape behaviour and plasma cortisol were determined to assess coping style. Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that individual variation in oxygen consumption in respirometry chambers are related to the expression of coping styles: individuals with higher oxygen consumption at the start and throughout the measurement period were shown to react passively (longer latency to escape) in a confinement stress. In addition, successive respirometry runs should not be assumed to result in habituation, as depending on an individual's coping style either habituation (in the case of passive copers) or sensitization (in the case of active copers) can occur.

For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour.

A recent model explains individual differences in a population as the result of trade-off between present and future reproduction. We tested this model on the two wing morphs, i.e. short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged (macropterous) specimens of the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus). Since it has been already demonstrated that the two wing morphs differ in their life-history strategies, this species is an ideal subject to test whether the specimens with different life-history strategies have different personalities as well. The results show that individuals behave consistently over time and across contexts, meaning observed bugs do have personalities. We also have found that in females, the two wing morphs have different personalities supporting the theoretical predictions, i.e. winged ones, which are supposed to have lower future reproductive value, are braver and more exploratory. We found no difference between the morphs in males. Differences in reproductive investment might explain this discrepancy between the sexes."

From an adaptive perspective, such limited behavioural plasticity is surprising, since a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Here, we argue that consistency can be advantageous because it makes individuals predictable. Predictability, however, can only be advantageous if at least some individuals in the population respond to individual differences. Consequently, the evolution of consistency and responsiveness are mutually dependent. We present a general analysis of this coevolutionary feedback for scenarios that can be represented as matrix games with two pure strategies (e. g. hawk-dove game, snowdrift game). We first show that responsive strategies are favoured whenever some individual differences are present in the population (e. g. due to mutation and drift). We then show that the presence of responsive individuals can trigger a coevolutionary process between responsiveness and consistency that gives rise to populations in which responsive individuals coexist with unresponsive individuals who show high levels of adaptive consistency in their behaviour. Next to providing an adaptive explanation for consistency, our results also link two key features associated with personalities, individual differences in responsiveness and behavioural consistency."

However, there is still a scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family) on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family. It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in more natural circumstances."

Habituation to predators is a special case of behavioural plasticity. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of boldness, exploration and sociability traits on the habituation ability of Iberian wall lizards, considering exposure and sex effects. Individual boldness was consistent across several non-habituation contexts, but it did not significantly affect habituation. Exploration had a strong direct effect on habituation, with more exploratory individuals being able to habituate faster than less exploratory ones, probably because of their ability to assess risk better. Individual variation in habituation was also affected by sociability, but this was an indirect effect mediated by exposure to the predator. Less social individuals avoided refuges with conspecific cues, increasing exposure to the predator and eventually habituation. Finally, the direct effects of sex (females habituated faster than males) were opposite to its indirect effects through exposure. We conclude that risk assessment, instead of the proactivity-reactivity gradient usually considered in the literature, can affect behavioural plasticity through complex interactions between direct and indirect effects, including exploratory behaviour, degree of exposure to the predator and sex, which represent novel mechanisms generating inter-individual variation in plasticity."

This phenomenon appears to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics. Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in both courtship and aggressive situations."

However, only a few such studies have examined how foraging parameters are influenced by different personality domains. In wild ungulates, the trade-off between the time spent on food intake and antipredator behaviour differs between individuals, but the underlying reason for this is not yet well understood. One possibility is that this trade-off reflects personality dimensions such as boldness. To relate foraging decisions to personality we measured personality and performed feeding experiments with familiar and novel food in familiar and novel situations. We measured personality traits in 15 tame fallow deer, using novel object tests (NO), behavioural observations (BO) and personality ratings (PR). Boldness dimensions were found using PR and NO, dominance dimensions were found using BO and PR, and a flexibility dimension was found using BO. Multitrait-multimethod analysis showed that similar dimensions were significantly correlated across different methods and that different dimensions were not significantly correlated, even if measured using the same method. We also found that novel food eaten in familiar situations and familiar food eaten in novel situations were strongly related to boldness but not dominance, flexibility or age. Thus the trade-off between the benefits of gaining more food and the costs of reduced vigilance or increased toxin ingestion reflect boldness. These findings highlight the nature of personality dimensions in ungulates and how boldness impacts foraging behaviour. (c) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In addition, we assessed to what extent personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome. Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual personality.

In order to understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment. Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects had little influence on these components of reproductive success. However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive strategies."

Here, we tested for correlations between 3 behavioral axes in brown trout ( Salmo trutta) parr: exploration tendency, behavioral flexibility, and aggressiveness. Next, we tested how these individual behaviors relate to social dominance and performance under natural conditions ( growth, survival, and movement). We found support for behavioral syndromes in brown trout with less explorative individuals being less aggressive and showing more flexible behavior. In addition, these low-explorative personality types grew faster than bolder conspecifics in the wild. Standardized aggression in the laboratory was a poor indicator of social dominance, and neither of these 2 traits affected performance in the wild. These results challenge the view that personality traits can be predicted by constant associations with life-history trade-offs (e.g., boldness is linked with rapid growth). Moreover, our findings suggest that fitness predictions from laboratory measures of behavior should be made with caution and ideally tested in nature."

Although the physiological basis and direct costs of aggression are generally well known, less is known about the physiological costs such as increased oxidative stress (OS). This can occur via increased leakage of oxidants during high metabolic demands such as physical activity, or by hormones regulating both metabolism and aggression. Here we address this within a natural population of White's skinks, Egernia whitii; a species in which both sexes exhibit consistent aggressive phenotypes, and sex-specific associations between testosterone and aggression. The results reveal that males' aggressive phenotype, independent of testosterone, was positively associated with antioxidant capacity (OXY), while there was no significant association in females. Oxidative damage (ROM) and oxidative stress index (OI), were not influenced by aggressive phenotype or testosterone, but showed borderline positive associations with body size (i.e., age). The results failed to show that high testosterone increases OS. Instead, OS may be related to sex-specific behavioural patterns associated with aggressive phenotype such as territory and mate acquisition. Although experimental work is needed to identify the causal links for these patterns, the results highlight the need to consider proximate mechanisms to understand constraints on phenotypic variation."

Here, we argue that personality is an important source of variation that may affect cognitive performance and we hypothesise mutual influences between personality and cognition across an individual's lifespan. In particular, we suggest that: 1) personality profiles may be markers of different cognitive styles; 2) success or failure in cognitive tasks could affect different personalities differently; 3) ontogenetic changes of personality profiles could be reflected in changes in cognitive performance.

Personality can play a central role in social behaviour both in dyadic interactions and in social networks. We investigated whether explorative behaviour, as proxy of personality of territorial male great tits (Parus major), predicts their own and their neighbours' territorial responses towards simulated intruders. Several weeks prior to playback, subjects were taken from the wild to test their exploratory behaviour in a standard context in the laboratory. Exploratory behaviour provides a proxy of personality along a slow-fast explorer continuum. Upon release, males were radio-tracked and subsequently exposed to interactive playback simulating a more or a less aggressive territorial intruder (by either overlapping or alternating broadcast songs with the subjects' songs). At the same time, we radio-tracked a neighbour of the playback subject. Male vocal responses during playback and spatial movements after playback varied according to male explorative behaviour and playback treatment. Males with lower exploration scores approached the loudspeaker less, and sang more songs, shorter songs and songs with slower element rates than did males with higher exploration scores. Moreover, neighbour responses were related to the explorative behaviour of the subject receiving the playback but not to their own explorative behaviour.

Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term.

Studies generally report consistent individual differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested whether individuals change their activity level differently within a single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5 min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity patterns.

Increasing research is revealing the adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability. We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3 measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational patterns of trait repeatability."

Exploration speed in novel environment tests is generally found to be positively correlated with movement distances in wild animals, but such studies tend to be limited to single measures of exploration and rarely investigate the role of other correlates of movement behavior in the wild. We show that scores of the speed of exploration of wild juvenile starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in novel environment tests are not correlated with either the maximum extent of, or the size of the most frequently used part of, their home range. By contrast, scores that reflect what parts of the novel environment were explored are correlated with the size of the most frequently used area and tend to be correlated with the maximum home range size. The latter relationship was stronger for individuals that were on average found in larger flocks and for individuals with less suitable foraging habitat in their range. We conclude that aspects of exploration other than its speed may be better predictors of exploration in the wild for some species. Moreover, our findings further illustrate that the association between animal personality traits such as exploration behavior and the behavioral ecology of wild animals may depend on the environmental or social context. These findings are discussed in the context of individual variation in the response to environmental variability."

Quantifying individual differences often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap, respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types, including trap-shy individuals.

We measured the behavioural type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and dispersal).

As behavioural patterns develop inside families, rearing conditions could have lasting effects on the expression of adult personality. In species with parental care, conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness, exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences. Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings. However, there has been little research on how personality relates to parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life."

Birdsong is among the best studied signalling systems, and song traits vary substantially among individuals. The question remains if variation in signalling also reflects more general and consistent individual characteristics. Such consistent individual differences in behaviour that are relatively stable over time and contexts are referred to as personality or behavioural syndromes. Here, we studied the relation between singing and explorative behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, using great tits (Parus major) under standardized aviary conditions. The results show that singing activity measured as the number of songs sung in spring prior to breeding correlated with male but not with female explorative behaviour. In contrast, song repertoire was not related to explorative behaviour but varied over the day. The link between explorative and singing behaviour suggests that sexually selected signals are more than signals of quality but can also reflect other intrinsic behavioural characteristics such as personality traits."

However, there is now evidence from a diverse range of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome? and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs.

We investigated the extent to which boldness and shyness affect the distribution of social herbivores across vegetation patches, using sheep as a model species. Using an experimental and a theoretical approach, we show that collective choices emerge through the nonlinear dynamics of interactions between individuals, at both short and long distances. Within a range of parameter values derived from the observation of homogeneous groups of each behavioural type, we propose a simple mechanism whereby the same interaction rules can result in different patterns of distribution across patches for bold and shy individuals. We present a mathematical model based on behavioural rules derived from experiments, in which crowding and con-specific attraction affect the probability of entering or leaving patches. Variation in the strength of social attraction is sufficient to account for differences in spatial distribution across patches. The model predicts that resource fragmentation more strongly affects the distribution patterns of shy groups, and suggests that the presence of both bold and shy individuals within groups would result in more flexible behaviour at the population level."

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals.

But a recent study by Magnhagen and Staffan (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 57:295-303, 2005) on young perch in small groups showed that boldness, a central personality trait, is also shaped by social interactions and by previous experience. The authors measured boldness by recording the duration that an individual spent near a predator and the speed with which it fed there. They found that duration near the predator increased over time and was higher the higher the average boldness of other group members. In addition, the feeding rate of shy individuals was reduced if other members of the same group were bold. The authors supposed that these behavioral dynamics were caused by genetic differences, social interactions, and habituation to the predator. However, they did not quantify exactly how this could happen. In the present study, we therefore use an agent-based model to investigate whether these three factors may explain the empirical findings. We choose an agent-based model because this type of model is especially suited to study the relation between behavior at an individual level and behavioral dynamics at a group level. In our model, individuals were either hiding in vegetation or feeding near a predator, whereby their behavior was affected by habituation and by two social mechanisms: social facilitation to approach the predator and competition over food. We show that even if we start the model with identical individuals, these three mechanisms were sufficient to reproduce the behavioral dynamics of the empirical study, including the consistent differences among individuals. Moreover, if we start the model with individuals that already differ in boldness, the behavioral dynamics produced remained the same. Our results indicate the importance of previous experience and social interactions when studying animal personality empirically."

Consistencies of behaviours and behavioural syndromes have mainly been studied in non-cooperative species. Insights on the evolution of cooperation could be gained from studying individual differences in life histories and behavioural traits. Kin selection theory predicts that if an individual's reproductive ability is low, it had to aim at gaining inclusive fitness benefits by helping others. We tested this prediction in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, by assessing reproductive parameters of adults that had been tested earlier for aggressiveness and for their propensity to assist breeders when they had been young ('juveniles'). We found that juvenile aggression levels predicted the acceptance of a subordinate in the group when adult. Males which were aggressive as juveniles were significantly more likely to tolerate a subordinate in the group when compared with males which were peaceful as juveniles, whereas females which were more aggressive as juveniles tended to expel subordinates more often. Females produced significantly smaller clutches when paired to males which had helped more as a juvenile, despite the fact that adult males hardly provided direct brood care. There was no evidence that females with a high propensity to help when young, produced smaller clutches or eggs when adult, but they took longer to lay their first clutch when compared with females with a low propensity to help when young. These results suggest that variation in behavioural types might explain variation in cooperation, the extent of group-living and reproductive decisions."

Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game.

We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.

In particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank, which partially determines mating success in this species. The expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or genetic basis.

On average, individual scores on three personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness, increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However, whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality. In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal personality, given that temperature has large direct effects on metabolic rates in ectotherms."

Characterizing and understanding this relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was correlated with body size or body condition.

The present study investigated the effect of two trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted: phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly, amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts. Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods.

Although observer ratings on expert-nominated behavioural descriptors have been successfully used to identify and measure temperament traits in non-human primates and other species, some researchers argue that these measurements may be contaminated by observer bias both in the nomination of descriptors and in ratings of individual animals by the observers. Instead, it has been suggested that a better means of measuring temperament relies on a bottom-up approach based on direct, quantitative measurements of a species' behavioural repertoire. In this study, we compare the utility of a trait-nomination-and-ratings approach and an approach using direct behavioural observation for identifying and describing the patterning of temperament traits a captive population of cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). Our data show that the nomination-based and the behavioural repertoire-based approaches yield very similar pictures of the patterning of temperament traits in cockatiels, although trait scales generated using the nomination-and-ratings approach have higher internal consistency. Additionally, trait scores on both the behavioural repertoire-based trait scales and the nomination/ratings-based trait scales show reasonable power to predict observed behaviour, consistent with findings in both humans and non-human animals. The nomination/ratings approach seems to be more powerful in predicting birds' behaviour towards novel objects. While further validation is certainly needed, the present results suggest that both methods may have some utility for describing temperament in cockatiels."

In the current study, we used female Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to ascertain whether certain reproductive traits (e.g. stage of pregnancy, fecundity) are correlated with individual personality in two wild populations in New South Wales, Australia. To quantitatively assess this relationship, we tested individual fish for their level of boldness, as measured by their latency to exit a refuge and tendency to shoal in a novel environment. We also quantified individual differences in general activity and tendency to swim near the water surface and substratum. For both populations taken together, bolder individuals tended to be smaller, relatively less fecund (when taking body size into account), and spent more time near the water surface than near the substratum compared with timid individuals. Individual boldness was not correlated with either general activity or stage of pregnancy.

Proportion of time an individual spent moving during prey search was quantified in the field, the individual was captured, and willingness to take risks (field), resting oxygen consumption (lab), and locomotor ability (lab) were measured. Individuals that spent a lesser proportion of time moving in the field took longer to exit from a dark tube into an unfamiliar field environment, and delayed their exit times more in response to a novel object, than did individuals that spent a greater proportion of time moving in the field. Proportion of time spent moving in the field was unrelated to resting oxygen consumption and swimming capacity measured in the laboratory. Dispositions in foraging behavior and risk taking early in life could influence encounter rates with novel prey and habitats, which are important steps in the initial stages of resource polymorphisms."

Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.

Behavioral syndromes involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice, and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction. Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context. Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context. Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context, may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior in this population."

Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species. Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings, behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic plasticity in wild populations."

Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch, we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration) between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts, the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion, the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and of considering the influence of social context in animal personality studies.

We studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object, aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals. Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration, aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability. Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality, male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population.

Strong trade-offs, mutation selection balance, spatio-temporal fluctuations in selection, frequency dependence and good-genes mate choice are invoked to explain heritable personality variation, yet for continuous behavioural traits, it remains unclear which selective force is likely to maintain distinct polymorphisms. Using a model of trust and cooperation, we show how allowing individuals to monitor each other's cooperative tendencies, at a cost, can select for heritable polymorphisms in trustworthiness. This variation, in turn, favours costly `social awareness' in some individuals. Feedback of this sort can explain the individual differences in trust and trustworthiness so often documented by economists in experimental public goods games across a range of cultures. Our work adds to growing evidence that evolutionary game theorists can no longer afford to ignore the importance of real world inter-individual variation in their models."

It is puzzling that cerebral lateralization, a seemingly advantageous trait, has not been driven to fixation. It has been suggested that variation in lateralization may be linked to individual variation in behaviour, which itself may be subject to disruptive selection. We examined the relation between cerebral lateralization and individual variation in boldness in the convict cichlid, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. We show that convict cichlids that are more strongly lateralized when exploring a familiar environment, but not a novel one, are quicker to emerge from a shelter in a test for boldness. The possibility that cerebral lateralization is linked to life history strategy is discussed. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Active individuals usually experience a higher encounter rate with food items and suffer higher predation pressure than less active individuals. I investigated how activity of the damselfly Lestes congener is affected by larval state and predator presence and if larval behavioral type (BT) can be used to predict larval boldness, foraging success, and adult BT. Activity level of individual larvae was studied without predator at 2 different physiological states (hungry and fed) and in 2 predator treatments: familiar predator cues and unfamiliar predator cues. Larvae did not adjust their activity depending on state or when subjected to unfamiliar predator cues, but a general reduction in activity was seen in the familiar predator treatment. Hence, active individuals remained active compared with their conspecifics, independent of state or predator treatment. Active individuals were also bolder and more efficient foragers than their less active conspecifics. Furthermore, both adult activity and boldness were correlated with larval BT. The results illustrate that BT of a larvae is carried over many different situations keeping active larvae active even in maladaptive situations, demonstrating how a behavioral syndrome may constrain behavioral plasticity. Furthermore, results showed that behavioral syndromes can carry over from larvae through metamorphosis and dictate the BT of the adult."

Much recent work has concentrated on behavioral variation within animal populations along the bold/shy continuum. Here, we screened individual guppies, Poecilia reticulata, for boldness using an overhead fright stimulus. We created groups consisting of 4 bold individuals (bold shoals), 4 shy individuals (shy shoals), or 2 bold and 2 shy individuals (mixed shoals). The performance of these different shoal types was then tested in a novel foraging scenario. We found that both bold and mixed shoals approached a novel feeder in less time than shy shoals. Interestingly, we found that more fish from mixed shoals fed than in either bold or shy shoals. We suggest that this can be explained by the fact that nearly all the cases where one fish was followed into the feeder by another occurred within mixed shoals and that it was almost always a shy fish following a bold one. These results suggest clear foraging benefits to shy individuals through associating with bold ones. Surprisingly, our results also suggest potential foraging benefits to bold individuals through associating with shy individuals.

However, the processes responsible for the maintenance of personality variability within a population are still largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that social personality traits exist in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) and that the variation in sociability provides an explanation for variable dispersal responses within a given species. However, we need to know the fitness consequences of variation in sociability across environmental contexts in order to better understand the maintenance of such variation. In order to achieve this, we investigated the relationship between sociability and survival, body growth and fecundity, in one-year-old individuals in semi-natural populations with varying density. `Asocial' and `social' lizards displayed different fitness outcomes in populations of different densities. Asocial lizards survived better in low-density populations, while social females reproduced better. Spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions might thus be the process underlying the maintenance of these personality traits within a population. Finally, we also discuss the position of sociability in a more general individual behavioural pattern including boldness, exploration and aggressiveness."

Relationships between `personality traits' and fitness imply that personality traits can evolve by means of natural selection. We studied whether animal personality is also involved in sexual selection. We investigated whether exploratory behaviour (an aspect of animal personality, ranging from `slow' to `fast') correlated with the occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in broods of wild great tits. We expected that EPP rates should be highest for females mated with social partners of the same personality type (i. e. for slowe-slow or fast-fast pairs, but not other pair combinations). We found that the likelihood of EPP was highest for these pairs. Disassortative extrapair mating with respect to personality can be the consequence of several non-mutually exclusive processes. It might be caused by adaptive mate choice, which allows assortatively paired females to produce offspring with either more variable or more intermediate phenotypes, but it could also be the consequence of behavioural incompatibility between extreme behavioural phenotypes. Our findings indicate that personality differences play a role in the mechanism behind extrapair behaviours and we therefore conclude that it is now plausible that partner preference is based not only on morphological characteristics, but also on consistent behavioural traits or personality.

However, it has also been noted that constraints on sensory acuity, cognitive structure and physiological capacities place limits on behavioural plasticity. Such limits to plasticity may generate consistent differences in behaviour between individuals from the same population. It has recently been suggested that these consistent differences in individual behaviour may be adaptive and the term `animal personalities' has been used to describe them. In many cases, however, a degree of both behavioural plasticity and relative consistency is probable. To understand the possible functions of animal personalities, it is necessary to determine the relative strength of each tendency and this may be achieved by comparison of statistical effect sizes for tests of difference and concordance. Here, we describe a new statistical framework for making such comparisons and investigate cross-situational plasticity and consistency in the duration of startle responses in the European hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus, in the field and the laboratory. The effect sizes of tests for behavioural consistency were greater than for tests of behavioural plasticity, indicating for the first time the presence of animal personalities in a crustacean model."

In this study, we investigated individual differences in personality in relation to nest defence behaviour in wild great tits. Nest defence is an important aspect of parental care and involves a trade-off between two fitness components (i.e. survival and reproduction). As a measure of personality we used exploratory behaviour in a novel environment as this has been shown to be correlated with several other behavioural traits including risk-taking and aggression, two important behavioural components of nest defence. We found that the intensity of alarm calling towards a human intruder was positively associated with exploratory behaviour, while there was a negative association between exploration score and number of movements during nest defence. Thus, fast explorers are shown to respond more boldly towards predators in the field. More generally we show that individuals with different personalities vary in their anti-predator and reproductive investment strategies."

Although several studies have reported life history correlates and selective consequences of this variation in shy/bold behaviour, little attention has been paid to developmental processes resulting in shy/bold phenotypes. Here, we present a lifetime developmental study of shy/bold behaviour in dumpling squid, Euprymna tasmanica. Behaviour was measured in two test contexts, a threat and a feeding test, at five times across the entire life span. Across test contexts, shy/bold behaviour was not correlated at any age; while within a test context, individual shy/ bold phenotypes were consistent both before and after sexual maturity. During sexual maturity, different phenotypes displayed different amounts of developmental variation; shyer animals were more plastic in feeding tests, while bolder animals were more plastic in threat ones. Our results suggest that for some animals shy/bold behaviour throughout development is uncorrelated across different contexts related to risk, while within a context, there may still be developmental constraints to changing shy/bold behaviour. This constraint within a functional context, however, may be phenotype-specific, with some phenotypes able to change more than others. These results indicate that a greater understanding of developmental pathways is needed to determine whether shy/bold phenotypes per se are the sole focus of selection. Differences in developmental plasticity between shy/bold phenotypes may also confer differential fitness in fluctuating environments. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Among the more promising of such associations is that between the human dopamine receptor D4 gene (Drd4) variants and novelty-seeking behaviour. However, genetic epistasis, genotype environment interactions and confounding environmental factors all act to obscure genotype-personality relationships. Such problems can be addressed by measuring personality under standardized conditions and by selection experiments, with both approaches only feasible with non-human animals. Looking for similar Drd4 genotype-personality associations in a free-living bird, the great tit (Parus major), we detected 73 polymorphisms (66 SNPs, 7 indels) in the P. major Drd4 orthologue. Two of the P. major Drd4 gene polymorphisms were investigated for evidence of association with novelty-seeking behaviour: a coding region synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP830) and a 15 bp indel (ID15) located 50 to the putative transcription initiation site. Frequencies of the three Drd4 SNP830 genotypes, but not the ID15 genotypes, differed significantly between two P. major lines selected over four generations for divergent levels of `early exploratory behaviour' (EEB). Strong corroborating evidence for the significance of this finding comes from the analysis of free-living, unselected birds where we found a significant association between SNP830 genotypes and differing mean EEB levels. These findings suggest that an association between Drd4 gene polymorphisms and animal personality variation predates the divergence of the avian and mammalian lineages. Furthermore, this work heralds the possibility of following microevolutionary changes in frequencies of behaviourally relevant Drd4 polymorphisms within populations where natural selection acts differentially on different personality types."

Bold individuals that lost fights or watched shy demonstrators became more shy by increasing their latency to approach a novel object, whereas shy observers that watched bold demonstrators remained cautious and did not modify their responses to novelty. Shy winners became bolder and decreased their latency to approach a novel object, but shy losers also displayed this shift. In comparison, control groups showed no change in behaviour.

Such consistent individual differences correlate with important life-history traits such as dispersal. Indeed, some environmental conditions are supposed to determine dispersers with a specific personality. For example, an increased density should promote the departure of individuals with less social tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that dispersers from high-density populations should primarily be asocial individuals, whereas dispersers from low-density populations should be social individuals. In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we measured attraction towards the odour of conspecifics on juveniles at birth as a metric of social tolerance. We then released these juveniles into populations of different densities and measured dispersal and settlement behaviours with regard to social tolerance. One year later, we again measured the social tolerance of surviving individuals. The social tolerance is constant across time and strongly reflects the individual's dispersal and settlement patterns with respect to population density. These results strongly suggest that social personalities exist and influence dispersal decisions. Further studies will help to elucidate the proximate and ultimate determinants of social personalities."

Both agonistic and competitive rank orders were determined for each group and we tested individuals in the absence of their groupmates for object neophobia, latency to feed in a novel environment and performance on an extractive foraging task. In each starling group, the fastest learners occupied the highest competitive ranks, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive ability is positively correlated with social dominance. Competitive rank orders, however, did not correlate significantly with agonistic rank orders. Situation-specific foraging neophobia was suggested: individuals showed consistency in their latencies to feed near a variety of novel objects, but no significant correlation was found between this measure of object neophobia and latency to feed in a novel environment. Starlings fastest to feed in the novel environment were fastest in solving the foraging task.

Here, we present a very simple model of how adaptively managing noisy information, combined with differences in individual state, can lead to evolutionarily stable differences in how individuals respond to environmental cues. When information is very noisy, behavioural syndromes are most likely, but as long as there is some error, some types of individuals display the same behaviour in all contexts. In extreme cases, very few individuals display flexible behaviour, and different stable behavioural types dominate the population. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

While we start knowing more about the proximal mechanisms responsible for the consistent differences in behaviour between individuals in a population, little is known yet about the relationship between the phenotypic distribution of personality traits, or combinations of traits, and fitness. Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the fitness consequences of personality traits in natural populations. We start by a description of two case studies that have examined the role of natural selection on personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great tit. Parus major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other studies that have reported some links between personality traits and fitness indices, in a large variety of animal species. We continue by outlining both direct approaches (i.e., measuring correlational selection on personality trait combinations) and indirect approaches (i.e., comparing correlations between personality traits within and between populations) to study suites of correlated traits from an adaptive perspective. This review, we hope, will be able to stimulate the use of the phenotypic selection analysis applied to the study of selection on personality traits in animals."

Studies on consistent individual differences in behavioural traits provide a good opportunity to do controlled experiments on the genetic mechanisms underlying the variation and covariation in complex behavioural traits. In this review we will highlight the contribution of genetic studies in animal personality research. We will start with reviewing the evidence that shows how much variation in animal personality traits is genetic, and connect this to knowledge from human personality studies. We will continue by considering the nature of that variation, its generation and maintenance. Finally we will point to further possibilities for studying the genetics of animal personalities. We will underline the importance of integrating both proximate and ultimate approaches when studying the evolution of animal personalities."

In this paper, I examine the benefits of using animal models to study how personality or stable individual differences (in behavior and physiology) influence disease susceptibility and resilience. Such an expansion of animal model use, to study the relationships among personality, physiology, and health, provides a unique complement to human studies. Human studies are necessarily correlational and involve minimally-invasive physiological measures, whereas animal studies can involve experimental manipulations of potentially causal variables. For example, with animal models, genetic and environmental precursors of personality can be manipulated to test how behavioral response biases affect health, and physiological parameters can be manipulated to observe resulting changes in behavioral traits and health. In addition to these experimental benefits, lifespan longitudinal studies can be conducted with short-lived animal models to address cumulative, potentially subtle effects of personality on health. In general, animal models allow for greater in-depth analyses of physiological processes underlying relationships between personality and health, and a means for determining causal mechanisms."

Using chaffinches Fringilla coelebs temporarily held in captivity, we determined the extent to which activity level (AL), the behavioural response to a stressful situation (BRSS) and two anti-predation risk behaviours when exposed to a model predator were inter-correlated within individuals. We assayed AL and BRSS when the chaffinches were first put in an experimental room. Subsequently we recorded their initial response (freeze or escape) to the sudden appearance of a model hawk, in addition to their latency to resume activity afterwards as a measure of cautiousness ('latency'). Each bird was assayed in two situations that differed in the risk level posed and in the assumed optimal response required to minimize predation risk: (I) high risk, when the hawk flew directly over the chaffinch and the assumed optimal response was to escape; and (2) low risk, when the model hawk flew 2 m to the side of the chaffinch and, since the bird was not being targeted, the assumed optimal response was to freeze in order to avoid attracting attention. All of the variables had relatively high repeatabilities and were inter-correlated, providing strong evidence for a behavioural syndrome. Though propensity to freeze was much greater in the low risk treatment, AL was negatively correlated with freezing behaviour in both risk treatments, and therefore there was a `behavioural carryover' across situations. While hypoactive individuals were more likely to freeze in the low risk treatment, and were therefore assumed to be better able to assess risk compared to hyperactive individuals, some hypoactive individuals also froze in the high risk situation when it was assumed to be inappropriate to do so. Despite this apparently maladaptive behaviour in the high risk situation, overall hypoactive individuals showed a greater degree of behavioural plasticity across treatments compared to hyperactives. Taken together our results support the hypothesis of differential predation risk among personality types. We discuss the implications of our results for current interest in personalities, and for predation risk and group-living theories."

Suites of these behaviors are referred to as behavioral syndromes or personalities. Personality traits are often phenotypically and genetically correlated. Therefore, animal personalities are generally considered as broad characteristics, with one underlying genetical and physiological mechanism that is expressed across situations and contexts. Because there are carryover effects between situations, animals are not entirely flexible in their behavior in each situation. This may cause behaviors to seem nonadaptive in isolated situations. To test whether individuals with different personalities could react differently to changes in their environment, we Studied context dependence of personalities in the great tit (Parus major). We tested birds categorized as either fast or slow explorers for their latency to come back to a feeding table after a mild startle (risk-taking behavior) in a nonsocial followed by a social context. We found that the relation between exploratory behavior and risk-taking behavior depended on the social context. Females in general returned later in the social test, while male reaction to the presence of a conspecific was dependent on their behavioral type. Slow males thereby reacted to the behavior of the companion and fast males did not. These results show that although personalities have a rigid structure the relation between personality traits is context dependent. These results are discussed in the perspective of the adaptive significance and maintenance of personalities."

This, together with the many uses the dog is put to in our society, makes the dog an interesting model for studies of animal personality. However, only a few attempts have been done to study individual differences in dogs. In this study, behavioural data from 15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds were used to investigate the existence of personality traits in dogs. The data were collected at a personality test that tested the dogs' reactions to strangers, ``fleeing{''} prey-like objects, and several potential fear- and aggression-eliciting stimuli. Factor analyses revealed the existence of five narrow traits: ``Playfulness{'' ``Curiosity/Fearlessness{''}, ``Chase-proneness{''}, ``Sociability{'' and ``Aggressiveness{''}. Higher-order factor analyses showed that all factors except ``Aggressiveness{''} were related to each other, creating a broad factor that influences behaviour in a range of situations. Both narrow and broad factors were found in a dataset including data from a large number of breeds, as well as within eight of Federation Cynologique Internationale's (FCI's) 10 breed groups. This indicates that the personality dimensions found in the study are general for the dog as a species. The finding of a major behavioural dimension in different groups of dog breeds, together with comparable results previously found for wolves (Canis lupus), suggests that the dimension is evolutionarily stable and has survived the varied selection pressures encountered during domestication. The broad factor is comparable to the shyness-boldness axis previously found in both humans and animals, and to human ``supertraits{''} (a combination of Extraversion and Neuroticism). The results of this study can be used to describe and compare individual dogs, as well as breeds. This, in turn, can be used in applications like selection of service dogs and breeding animals, as well as predicting behaviour problems in pet dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Scientists frequently use such terms in studies of animal personality and temperament, but, wary of anthropomorphism, are reluctant to do so in studies of animal welfare. We hypothesize that qualitative behaviour assessment, in describing behaviour as an expressive process, may have a stronger observational foundation than is currently recognized, and may be of use as an integrative welfare assessment tool. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the inter- and intraobserver reliability of spontanous qualitative assessments of pig, Sus scrofa, behaviour provided by nine naive observers. We used an experimental methodology called `free choice profiling' (FCP), which gives observers complete freedom to choose their own descriptive terms. Data were analysed with generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), a multivariate statistical technique associated with FCP. Observers achieved significant agreement in their assessments of pig behavioural expression in four separate tests, and could accurately repeat attributing expressive scores to individual pigs across these tests. Thus the spontaneous qualitative assessment of pig behaviour showed strong internal validity under our controlled experimental conditions. In conclusion we suggest that qualitative behaviour assessment reflects a `whole animal' level of organization, which may guide the intepretation of behavioural and physiological measurements in terms of an animal's overall welfare state.
