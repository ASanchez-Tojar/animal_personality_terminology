Abstract = {{Animals are thought to adjust the intensity of their parental defense to
   fitness benefits associated with their current reproduction. They should
   be more defensive when they breed early in the season, when they produce
   more young, or as their young get older. Beyond these plastic changes,
   associations among traits could be explained by consistent
   among-individual differences. Separating the mechanisms at the origin of
   behavioral phenotypic variation is essential to understand the
   determinants and evolution of parental care. During four breeding
   seasons, we investigated whether variation in Canada goose (Branta
   canadensis) nest defense resulted from individual short-term plastic
   adjustments to reproductive stage within breeding seasons, plastic
   adjustments to brood value across breeding seasons, or from long-term
   among-individual differences. We thus estimated the among- and
   within-individual relationships between nest defense, clutch size, and
   laying date. Female and male nest defense behaviors were highly
   repeatable in time (R=0.72 and 0.67 on the short term). At the
   among-individual level, we found no significant association between
   female nest defense and life history traits, but the more defensive
   males were mated with the more fecund females. Female and male nest
   defense was not adjusted to annual variation in laying date nor in
   clutch size. However, females adjusted their nest defense within each
   breeding season and became more defensive when approaching egg hatching.
   Thus, Canada goose nest defense behavior is partly explained by plastic
   adjustments, but also by consistent among-individual differences which
   indicate the evolutionary potential of nest defense
   behavior.Significance statementAn association between traits at the
   phenotypic level can be partitioned into association at the among- and
   within-individual levels. This allows to better understand covariation
   of traits resulting from both among-individual differences and
   phenotypic plasticity. We observed 141 Canada goose pairs to identify
   what affected the intensity of their nest defense behavior. We found
   that geese were very consistent in their nest defense behavior and that
   female fecundity was related to male personality. Females also became
   more defensive as their young got older. Analyzing different sources of
   variation in parental behaviors enables a better understanding of their
   evolution. Our study also demonstrates the importance of studying nest
   defense in both sexes even in species where only females incubate eggs,
   as both sexes can invest in nest defense.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits influence habitat choice,
   and in turn, differences in used habitats shape different behavioural
   tendencies through plasticity. Here, I investigated the relationship
   between personality and microhabitat use in a free-living population of
   the clonal gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris. The study site is a small
   beachfront forest facing two environments with contrasting levels of
   human disturbance. I conducted a mark-recapture survey to assess the
   geckos' spacing pattern and evaluated their boldness and exploration
   scores in the laboratory. The geckos exhibited a small range of movement
   and a high consistency in their perch height. Boldness was related to
   two microhabitat features, but exploration was not. Relatively shy
   geckos were found in trees near the roadside and on low branches,
   whereas relatively bold geckos were found on both the beachside and the
   roadside and on low to high branches. These patterns suggest that geckos
   in high-disturbance microhabitats may have frequently experienced
   artificial stimuli and become shy. However, the present results cannot
   exclude the possibility that individual differences are caused by other
   factors and that different personality types prefer and settle in
   different microhabitats. Although the actual mechanisms are unclear, my
   findings highlight that behaviour-related habitat use emerges even in
   clonal animals.Significance statementIndividuals within conspecifics
   show different spacing patterns and different behavioural tendencies. If
   clonal animals live in a spatially diverse environment, it is predicted
   that different microhabitats may gradually shape different personality
   types through developmental plasticity. Here, I investigated the
   association between the personality of clonal geckos and their
   microhabitat use in different levels of human disturbance. In contrast
   to the prediction, both juveniles and adults showed a similar pattern of
   boldness-related microhabitats; relatively shy individuals were found in
   putatively high-disturbance sites. This result suggests that the
   association between boldness and microhabitats is not gradually formed
   through a long-time scale but is likely generated within their early
   ontogenetic stage.}},

Title = {{Nest-site defence aggression during courtship does not predict nestling
   provisioning in male collared flycatchers}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{73}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Individuals of many animal species show consistent differences in
   ecologically relevant behaviours, and these individual-specific
   behaviours can correlate with each other. In passerines, aggression
   during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been
   steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in
   several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive
   investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males
   toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care.
   This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice,
   they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality.
   We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity
   of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for
   aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not
   related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between
   the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their
   mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the
   parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does
   not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that
   higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males
   often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male
   testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the
   parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in
   territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling
   provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in
   distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further
   investigation.Significance statementMale songbirds, when attracting
   mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these
   male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance
   during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a
   male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour
   as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated
   the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding
   activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated
   territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded
   their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that
   territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate.
   This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the
   breeding season does not carry information for females about what to
   expect from potential mates in terms of parental care.}},

Abstract = {{The predation and dispersal of seeds by scatter-hoarding animals is one
   of the most studied processes in the context of animal-plant
   interactions. Seed management by these animals has been traditionally
   approached at the population level: the patterns documented in the field
   are assumed to be similar for all individuals of the population and the
   variability within the population is considered to be random noise.
   However, little is known about to what extent this variability responds
   to different and consistent behaviours between individuals. The aim of
   this study was to analyse the individual variation and consistency in
   behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents within a population. As our model
   we used the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a key disperser of holm oak
   acorns, Quercus ilex, which, in turn, suffers high predation pressure by
   the common genet, Genetta genetta. In two sets of laboratory
   experiments, we compared the variance and consistency in behaviours and
   acorn management due to individual differences with that due to
   manipulation, using genet scents, of the perceived predation risk. Genet
   scents reduced the activity (i.e. time out of the refuge) in all wood
   mice, but the differences and consistency in activity between
   individuals accounted for most of the variance. Also, mice showed
   different and consistent stress or relaxed behaviours. Most of the
   variance in seed management variables, such as dispersal distance and
   seed size selection, was explained by consistent differences between
   individuals across scent treatments. The increase in stress behaviours
   and decrease in relaxed behaviours were positively related to dispersal
   ability (i.e. longer distances and larger acorns). Our study highlights
   the importance of considering the individual component of behaviour in
   scatter-hoarding rodents. This fine-scale level, largely overlooked in
   the ecological framework, will help to increase our understanding of
   seed management by scatter-hoarding animals. (C) 2019 The Association

   study in a reef fish population}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{219-237}},

Abstract = {{The link between ecology and reproductive isolation constitutes the
   cornerstone of the ecological hypothesis of speciation. Such a link can
   arise when traits under ecologically based selection are also used as
   cues for mating ('magic traits') or as a by-product of habitat choice
   when mating takes place within habitats. Here, we propose that
   behavioural syndromes may also constitute such a link. We illustrate
   this mechanism in the butter hamlet, Hypoplectrus unicolor, a reef fish
   from the wider Caribbean, with aggressive mimicry as the focal
   ecological trait. Aggressive mimicry is of particular interest in
   hamlets since it has been proposed to play a key role in the radiation
   of Hypoplectrus. Individuals from a natural population in Bocas del
   Toro, Panama, were tagged and their diurnal and spawning behaviours
   observed over 2 years. The results indicate that aggressive mimicry
   behaviour differed consistently between individuals and formed two
   discrete behavioural types that also differed with respect to
   territoriality. Differences in territoriality between the two
   behavioural types translated into different use of space in spawning
   contexts, which generated a tendency for assortative mating by
   behavioural type. This case study illustrates how behavioural syndromes
   may form a link between ecologically relevant behavioural traits and
   mate choice, suggesting that they might play an underappreciated role in
   the early stages of speciation. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{A key goal in the study of animal personalities is to determine their
   adaptive potential and importance for behavioral evolution. Behavioral
   syndromes are evolutionarily intriguing because they suggest that an
   adaptive change in one behavior requires a concomitant shift in another.
   Within species, behavioral syndromes might be evolutionarily constrained
   by intrinsic mechanisms that restrict behaviors from evolving
   independently. Alternatively, behavioral correlations might easily be
   decoupled over short evolutionary time scales due to variation in
   selective pressures between environments. In this regard, comparative
   studies that explore differences in diverse aspects of personality
   between geographically distinct populations can provide valuable
   insights into the evolutionary processes acting on different behavioral
   tendencies. Accordingly, we investigated how behavioral types and
   behavioral syndromes differed across four geographically distinct
   populations of the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. We found
   strong evidence of mean trait-level variation in activity, exploration,
   and boldness across populations, suggesting adaptation to local
   environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that within-population
   correlations involving boldness varied substantially between
   populations. However, we did find a consistent within- and
   among-population correlation between activity and exploration,
   suggesting that this behavioral syndrome is relatively stable and could
   explain behavioral divergence in activity and exploration between
   populations. We suggest that there may be thermal physiological
   mechanisms that could be limiting the adaptive potential of an
   activity-exploration correlation in the delicate skink. Broadly, we
   argue that some behavioral correlations may be more adaptive than
   others, and that this should be more regularly considered within the
   animal personality framework.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity is known to influence the mean behavioral
   phenotype of a population. Yet, studies on how developmental plasticity
   shapes patterns of variation within populations are comparatively rare
   and often focus on a subset of developmental cues (e.g., nutrition). One
   potentially important but understudied developmental experience is
   social experience, as it is explicitly hypothesized to increase
   variation among individuals as a way to promote social niches. To test
   this, we exposed juvenile black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) to
   the silk of conspecifics by transplanting them onto conspecific webs for
   48 h once a week until adulthood. We also utilized an untouched control
   group as well as a disturbed group. This latter group was removed from
   their web at the same time points as the social treatment, but was
   immediately placed back on their own web. After repeatedly measuring
   adult behavior and web structure, we found that social rearing drove
   higher or significant levels of repeatability relative to the other
   treatments. Repeatability in the social treatment also decreased in some
   traits, paralleling the decreases observed in the disturbed treatments.
   Thus, repeated juvenile disturbance may decrease among-individual
   differences in adult spiders. Yet, social rearing appeared to override
   the effect of disturbance in some traits, suggesting a prioritization
   effect. The resulting individual differences were maintained over at
   least one-third of the adult lifespan and thus appear to represent
   stable, canalized developmental effects and not temporal state
   differences. These results provide proximate insight into how a broader
   range of developmental experiences shape trait variation.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decades, the study of ``animal personalities{''} has
   gained increasing importance in the field of behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology, thereby contributing to a focus shift from the
   population to the individual in various research disciplines. Against
   this background, the overall idea of the present review is to transfer
   the personality concept from behavioural ecology to animal welfare
   science, to discuss the role of the individual in different research
   approaches and to pave new grounds for a more individual-tailored
   assessment and treatment of welfare-related problems. Moreover, we will
   explicitly refer to welfare issues ``beyond the average{''}, thereby
   addressing problems that are not entirely covered by simply studying
   personality traits in animal welfare research. By combining two
   different fields, we hope to stimulate more theoretical and empirical
   work on this topic to find new ways of improving the welfare of animals
   in human hands even at the individual level.}},

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies increasingly show that personality types in animals can
   vary with time. Personality types including boldness and aggression have
   been recently reported as important determinants of collective task
   performance, task specialisation and task proficiency in social spiders.
   These studies were performed in subadult and adult spiders and over the
   short term (3-15days). Therefore, the ontogeny of these personality
   types and its persistence over timescales relevant to the lifespan of
   any social spider species remains unknown. In the social spider
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum, we investigated 1) if early instar juveniles
   exhibited consistent and repeatable personality types, 2) if personality
   types persisted over the long term in subadults and 3) if personality
   types are influenced by subadult body condition. Juveniles (3rd and 4th
   instars) showed consistent inter-individual differences and
   repeatability in boldness and aggression (across 21days). Subadults
   showed consistency in boldness and aggression over a duration of 51days,
   which covers a significant part of the subadult stage. However,
   repeatability of these traits declined over the long term. Moreover,
   boldness and aggression were not influenced by body condition
   (nutritional state) of subadults. Thus, we hypothesise that the early
   ontogeny of personality and its long-term persistence can influence
   behavioural propensities and task partitioning through later life stages
   in social spider colonies.Significance statementPersonalities have been
   demonstrated in a number of animal species. In animal societies,
   individuals with different personality types are known to engage in
   different activities within the group, leading to overall efficiency.
   Personalities have recently been shown to exist in social spiders. For
   example, aggressive spiders have a greater tendency to hunt prey than
   less aggressive individuals. However, for most animals, it remains
   unknown whether personality types manifest in very young individuals.
   Here, we show for the first time in social spiders that juveniles have
   personalities just as in adults. We also show that personality types
   persist over significant portions of individuals' life spans. These
   findings show that stable personality types can be important in
   collective tasks such as capturing prey.}},

Title = {{Temperature preference of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) juveniles
   induces spontaneous sex reversal}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an African freshwater fish that
   displays a genetic sex determination system (XX vertical bar XY) where
   high temperatures (above 32 degrees C to 36.5 degrees C) induce
   masculinization. In Nile tilapia, the thermosensitive period was
   reported from 10 to 30 days post fertilization. In their natural
   environment, juveniles may encounter high temperatures that are above
   the optimal temperature for growth (27-30 degrees C). The relevance of
   the thermal sex reversal mechanism in a natural context remains unclear.
   The main objective of our study is to determine whether sexually
   undifferentiated juveniles spontaneously prefer higher, unfavorable
   temperatures and whether this choice skews the sex ratio toward males.
   Five full-sib progenies (from 100\% XX crosses) were subjected to (1) a
   horizontal three-compartment thermal step gradient (thermal continuum 28
   degrees C-32 degrees C-36.5 degrees C) during the thermosensitive
   period, (2) a control continuum (28 degrees C-28 degrees C-28 degrees C)
   and (3) a thermal control tank (36.5 degrees C). During the first days
   of the treatment, up to an average of 20\% of the population preferred
   the masculinizing compartment of the thermal continuum (36.5 degrees C)
   compared to the control continuum. During the second part of the
   treatment, juveniles preferred the lower, nonmasculinizing 32 degrees C
   temperature. This short exposure to higher temperatures was sufficient
   to significantly skew the sex ratio toward males, compared to congeners
   raised at 28 degrees C (from 5.0 +/- 6.7\% to 15.6 +/- 16.5\% of males).
   The proportion of males was significantly different in the thermal
   continuum, thermal control tank and control continuum, and it was
   positively correlated among populations. Our study shows for the first
   time that Nile tilapia juveniles can choose a masculinizing temperature
   during a short period of time. This preference is sufficient to induce
   sex reversal to males within a population. For the first time, behavior
   is reported as a potential player in the sex determination mechanism of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{When deciding between different options, animals including humans face
   the dilemma that fast decisions tend to be erroneous, whereas accurate
   decisions tend to be relatively slow. Recently, it has been suggested
   that differences in the efficacy with which animals make a decision
   relate closely to individual behavioural differences. In this paper, we
   tested this hypothesis in a unique unicellular organism, the slime mould
   Physarum polycephalum. We first confirmed that slime moulds differed
   consistently in their exploratory behaviour from `fast' to `slow'
   explorers. Second, we showed that slow explorers made more accurate
   decisions than fast explorers. Third, we demonstrated that slime moulds
   integrated food cues in time and achieved higher accuracy when sampling
   time was longer. Lastly, we showed that in a competition context, fast
   explorers excelled when a single food source was offered, while slow
   explorers excelled when two food sources varying in quality were
   offered. Our results revealed that individual differences in accuracy
   were partly driven by differences in exploratory behaviour. These
   findings support the hypothesis that decision-making abilities are
   associated with behavioural types, even in unicellular organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in cognition have been shown to be common in some

   We tested whether wild bat-eared foxes Otocyon megalotis differ in a

   appetitive association learning performance. While our result shows that
   individuals differed in their tameness, we found no association between
   this personality trait and learning the appetitive association. This
   result does not support the framework that differences in cognition are
   associated with differences in personality; however, our small sample
   size does not allow us to assert that personality cannot be associated
   with cognition in this system. This study highlights that measuring
   cognition and personality in wild systems presents added difficulty and

Title = {{Current energy state interacts with the developmental environment to
   influence behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{148}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that among-individual differences in
   behaviour are, in part, generated by environmental effects. For example,
   diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural
   variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e.
   as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait
   expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of
   variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a
   trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other
   traits, remains unclear. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design crossing life
   stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy
   content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on
   the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for
   their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither
   developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means
   or on the expression of an activity-antipredator response syndrome,
   suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for
   increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a
   high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for
   antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with
   higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural
   plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in
   within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during
   development also mediated the links between maturation time and
   exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when
   exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was
   absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes
   in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life
   history and behavioural traits later in life. (C) 2018 The Association

Abstract = {{Understanding causes and consequences of behavioural plasticity is a
   major focus in animal behaviour studies for its importance to any
   population's ability to persist under changing environments. However,
   behavioural plasticity in traits linked to reproduction has received
   surprisingly limited attention, especially in species exhibiting
   alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). In this study, we explored how
   behavioural plasticity in ARTs varies in response to social conditions
   in male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, an internally fertilizing fish in
   which males can switch between two ARTs to achieve matings. Males can
   either court receptive females using elaborate mating displays
   (courtship), or attempt forced copulations without prior display or
   female cooperation (sneaking). Although males have a genetic
   predisposition to engage predominantly in one tactic over the other, the
   extent to which social experience shapes individual plasticity in these
   tactics is unknown. We observed that between-individual variation in
   mating effort and preferred ARTs was repeatable over time and largely
   explained by variation in body size and coloration between individuals.
   Moreover, we showed experimentally that males exposed to social cues
   rapidly developed a preference towards either sneaking or courting,
   resulting in a rapid decline in individual plasticity compared to their
   socially deprived counterparts. These findings accord with the
   theoretical predictions that behavioural plasticity should decline as
   individuals incrementally adjust to local environmental conditions and,
   thus, when environmental uncertainty is reduced. (C) 2018 The

Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Animal individuals show patterns of behavior that are stable within
   individuals but different among individuals. Such individual differences
   are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and
   in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in
   specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent
   across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field
   investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying
   nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context.
   We further investigated how individual differences affect choice
   performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized
   behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually
   identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar
   of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral
   measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the
   two-month observation period. We investigated the link between
   individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using
   generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice
   performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that
   bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid
   unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed
   model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare
   hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of
   between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our
   study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This
   may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual
   behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models
   of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like
   other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of
   consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We
   characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild,
   free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from
   computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest.
   Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different
   ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For
   example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others
   tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before
   returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also
   consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with
   dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few
   visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging
   strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{As is the case for humans, it has long been thought that nonhuman
   primates can be described in terms of their personality. Scientific
   observations that support this view include the presence of individual
   differences in social behavior and that they are relatively stable
   throughout life. Consequently, individuals are constrained in their
   behavioral flexibility when dealing with various environmental
   challenges. Still, the variation among individuals during development
   suggests that the environment influences how primates behave. Research
   in fields including psychology, behavior genetics, and behavioral
   ecology have tried to identify the mechanisms responsible for this
   interplay of behavioral stability and change. In this review, we
   integrate theories and findings from research on humans and nonhuman
   primates that highlight how and to what extent genetic and environmental
   contributions shape the development of social behavior. To do so, we
   first provide an overview and define what is meant by mean-level and
   rank-order change of behavior. We then review explanations of behavioral
   stability and change, focusing on the role of genetic effects, how
   environmental circumstances influence behavioral variation throughout
   development, and how genetic and environmental influences may interact
   to produce this variation. Finally, we point to future research
   directions that could help us to further understand the development of
   social behavior in primates from within a behavior genetics framework.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersers should express different foraging or social behaviors than
   nondispersers to thrive in unfamiliar habitats. In pied flycatchers
   (Ficedula hypoleuca), naive dispersers (immigrants) had a more
   generalist diet and higher feeding rates compared with philopatric
   birds, but we found no difference in level of aggression. Males with
   more generalist diet fledged more young. This suggests that learning or
   early imprinting affects individual food and settlement choices and that
   dispersers adopt different life-history strategies.
   Abstract Dispersal is an essential process for most animal populations
   to persist in changing environments. Dispersers are often a nonrandom
   sample of the population, and differ consistently from nondispersers in
   a suite of correlated phenotypic traits (dispersal syndromes). This
   phenotypic integration is thought to be adaptive. Here, we investigate
   whether dispersal tendency of individual pied flycatchers (Ficedula
   hypoleuca) covaries with a set of repeatable behaviors that should
   confer advantages for surviving and reproducing in novel environments.
   We specifically focus on the link between dispersal, foraging behavior,
   and aggressiveness because selection on foraging tactics or social
   behaviors likely differs between individuals staying in familiar or
   dispersing to novel environments. Using repeated measures of nestling
   provisioning data of pied flycatcher parents in 1 year, we tested if
   immigrants and philopatric individuals (local recruits and experienced
   breeders) differed in diet specialization, provisioning rates, levels of
   aggression, and reproductive success. Results show that individuals
   differed consistently in their foraging behavior, with immigrants having
   a more generalist diet and higher feeding rates than philopatric birds,
   but not in aggressiveness. More generalist males fledged more young. Our
   findings suggest that prior local knowledge facilitates diet
   specialization, and that more generalist diets could be adaptive for
   immigrants breeding in unknown environments. Aggressiveness was not part
   of the dispersal syndrome in our population, perhaps because high
   aggression levels are too costly to maintain in high density
   populations. Understanding the proximate causes and ultimate
   consequences of variation in dispersal syndromes requires now
   experimental manipulations of individual dispersal decisions.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{91-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality traits and the emergence of behavioural syndromes,
   i.e. between-individual correlation of behaviours, are commonly
   quantified from behavioural observations in controlled environments.
   Subjecting large and elusive wildlife to controlled test situations is,
   however, rarely possible, suggesting that ecologists should exploit
   alternative measures of behaviours for quantifying differences between
   individuals. Our goal was to test whether movement and space use data
   can be used to quantify behavioural syndromes in the wild. We quantified
   six behaviours from GPS and dual motion sensor tracking devices of 46
   adult female brown bears followed in southcentral Sweden over the summer
   and early autumn. As well as daily travel distance, an indicator for
   activity, and daily displacement, an indicator for exploration, we
   quantified four behaviours that increase a bear's likelihood of
   encountering humans and could thus serve as indicators for boldness:
   diurnality, selection for roads and selection for two open habitat
   types, bogs and clearcuts, with low lateral cover. We tested (1) whether
   behaviours showed repeatable between-individual variation (animal
   personality) and (2) whether behaviours were correlated between
   individuals and thus formed a behavioural syndrome. Repeatability of
   behaviours ranged from 0.16 to 0.61 confirming between-individual
   variation in movement, activity and space use. A multivariate mixed
   model revealed significant positive correlations between travel
   distance, displacement and diurnality, suggesting the existence of an
   activity-exploration and potentially partial boldness syndrome in our
   bear population. Selection for exposed or human-frequented habitats were
   uncorrelated with the activity-exploration syndrome and with each other,
   albeit there was a trend for stronger road avoidance by bears that
   readily used clearcuts. We show that large tracking data sets can be
   used to quantify between-individual correlation in spatial behaviours.
   We suggest that delineating behavioural types from wildlife tracking
   data will be of increasing interest because of the importance of animal
   personality for ecological processes, wildlife conservation and
   human-wildlife coexistence. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Pages = {{105-114}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Living in a seasonally changing environment requires periodic,
   reversible changes in animals' phenotypes to match variations in their
   abiotic and biotic environments. These changes may relate to temperature
   regulation, torpor use, basal metabolic rate, body mass or behaviour,
   all acting in concert to ensure the best adjustment to the environmental
   challenges. As winter approaches, many small mammals develop a winter
   phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a
   summer one. However, there is a significant within-population
   polymorphism in winter phenotype. We hypothesized that winter phenotype
   is correlated with consistent between-individual differences in animal
   behaviour, i.e. animal personality, and energy metabolism. We measured
   basal metabolic rate (BMR) and behavioural traits in three winter
   phenotypes of Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, which were
   acclimated to summer-like and then to winter-like conditions: fully
   responding, nonresponding and partially responding to a short
   photoperiod. We found no differences in behavioural traits between
   hamsters of different winter phenotypes, but the seasonal increase in
   activity was lowest in full responders indicating their lower
   behavioural flexibility than partial responders and nonresponders. The
   same was true for BMR. While nonresponders and partial responders
   increased their BMR from summer to winter, full responders did not
   change it. We argue that different winter phenotypes are maintained in
   the population because they could be beneficial under different
   environmental conditions. We also suggest that within a population there
   is a continuum of winter phenotypes, which is not related to differences
   in animal personalities. This continuum allows for population
   maintenance despite environmental conditions changing over short and
   long timescales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Individual variation in behaviour has been shown to have important
   ecological and evolutionary consequences. Research on animal personality
   has therefore received considerable attention, yet some methodological
   issues remain unresolved. We tested whether assessing personality by
   coding common behaviours is as time-consuming method as some researchers
   believe it to be. Altogether, 300 hours of observation were collected on
   20 captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). We first examined the
   repeatability of behavioural indices that represented the behavioural
   repertoire of cotton-top tamarins. We then compared the personality
   structures, based on different lengths of observation time, of these
   behavioural indices. The minimum observational time necessary to obtain
   a stable personality structure was 5 to 7 hours per individual. This
   stable structure included two components: Extraversion and Confidence,
   which were similar to those described in great apes, Old World monkeys,
   and other New World monkeys. Our findings suggest that, at least in the
   case of cotton-top tamarins, behavioural coding over relatively short
   periods of time can be used to assess personality and that longer
   observation periods may yield diminishing returns.}},

Abstract = {{Individual responses, particularly based on personality, can have
   important consequences for individual fitness, based upon success in
   exploring new habitats, feeding on novel foods, and aggressiveness in
   competitive interactions. We conducted laboratory experiments to analyze
   individual responses to different artificial conditions that could suit
   specific male and female personalities in the endangered seahorse,
   Hippocampus reidi. Our experiments with H. reidi evaluated individual
   responses to a new habitat, novel objects, level of inactivity and
   social interactions. We demonstrate that approximately half of the
   seahorses have a bold personality, readily inspecting new habitats and
   objects and sporadically presenting social approaches. The remaining shy
   individuals had high levels of inactivity and did not check novelties in
   their habitats. Although we expected that males would have shyer
   personalities when compared with females, due to their ecological role
   in the provision of parental care, we found no statistical difference
   between the sexes in terms of these aspects of personality. The similar
   frequency of both types of personality in males and females suggests
   that these features may be balanced and evolutionarily stable in the
   sampled population.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{532-539}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Individuals are known to differ consistently in various aspects of their
   behaviour in many animal species, a phenomenon that has come to be
   referred to as animal personalities. These individual differences are
   likely to have evolutionary and ecological significance, and it is
   therefore important to understand the precise nature of how
   environmental and physiological factors affect animal personalities. One
   factor which may affect personality is disease, but while the effects of
   disease on many aspects of host behaviour are well known, the effects on
   animal personalities have been little studied. Here we show that wood
   ants, Formica rufa, exhibit consistent individual differences in three
   personality traits: boldness, sociability and aggressiveness. However,
   experimental exposure to a virulent fungal parasite, Metarhizium
   pingshaense, had surprisingly little effect on the personality traits.
   Parasite-challenged ants showed marginal changes in sociability at high
   doses of parasite but no change in boldness or aggressiveness even when
   close to death. There was similarly little effect of other physiological
   stresses on ant personalities. The results suggest that individual
   personality in ants can be remarkably resilient to physiological stress,
   such as that caused by parasite infection. Future studies are needed to
   determine whether there is a similar resilience in solitary animals, as
   well as in other social species.}},

Title = {{Behavioral syndrome persists over metamorphosis in a pond-breeding
   amphibian}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, behavioral ecology has shifted from assuming animal
   behavior is infinitely plastic and situation specific to recognizing
   that behavior can be limited in its plasticity and correlated across
   different ecological situations. At the center of this new framework are
   behavioral syndromes or consistent individual differences in behavioral
   tendencies. Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified the
   evolutionary mechanisms and ecological implications of behavioral
   syndromes. However, the persistence of behavioral syndromes over
   ontogeny remains an open question. Species with complex life cycles
   present an interesting system in which to test the persistence of
   behavioral syndromes, because such life histories are thought to evolve
   when correlations between life stages are costly. In this study, we
   tested the hypothesis that behavioral tendencies of species with complex
   life histories are consistent within a life stage (before or after
   metamorphosis) but not between life stages. We experimentally assayed
   the activity, boldness, and exploration of spotted salamanders
   (Ambystoma maculatum) before and after metamorphosis. We found most
   behaviors to be at least moderately repeatable. Additionally, there was
   support for a behavioral syndrome within the larval stage as well as
   between larval behaviors and juvenile boldness. Our results reject the
   adaptive decoupling hypothesis and instead suggest that behavioral
   syndromes in species with complex life cycles can be maintained over
   metamorphosis.Significance statementA central prediction of behavioral
   syndromes is that individual behavioral consistency should be maintained
   over the life of an organism. However, in species with complex life
   cycles, evolution is thought to act independently on each stage, leading
   to the prediction that behavioral syndromes should not persist over
   metamorphosis. We tested for behavioral correlations over metamorphosis
   by assaying salamander activity, boldness, and exploration in larval and
   juvenile salamanders. We found support for behavioral syndromes within
   and between life stages. These findings contradict the predictions of
   complex life cycle evolution and instead suggest that behavioral
   syndromes may span metamorphosis. However, because support for the
   persistence of syndromes over metamorphosis varies between taxa, we
   caution researchers against extrapolating inferences from the larval
   stage to the juvenile stage.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of animal groups may be different and predictable
   depending on their collective behavior. Farmerfish (Stegastes nigricans)
   live in social groups and collectively defend gardens of palatable
   algae. These gardens also serve as settlement and nursery habitats for
   corals because farmerfish mob corallivores that attempt to forage on
   corals within these gardens. We detected large among-colony differences
   in farmerfish collective aggression towards intruder fish that persisted
   across years. We further found that the territories of aggressive groups
   and territories containing larger farmerfish provided greater protection
   to corals: territories of aggressive groups naturally harbored more
   branching corals than nonaggressive groups, and experimentally
   outplanted branching corals experienced 80\% less skeletal loss and grew
   larger over 25 weeks in aggressive territories than in nonaggressive
   territories. These findings hint that factors that increase farmerfish
   group aggressiveness (e.g., higher temperatures) could enhance the
   protective value of farmerfish territories for the replenishment of
   coral populations.}},

Abstract = {{Urban environments impose novel challenges on animals and, as a result,
   the behaviors of urban wildlife are changing. In particular, high
   exploratory tendencies and an ability to gather more information from
   the environment may facilitate adoption of novel ecological
   opportunities. As of yet, very few studies have examined if urbanization
   predicts the way in which animals explore novel environments, or the
   extent of among-individual variation within these habitats. Here, we
   assess exploration and its temporal plasticity in blackcapped chickadees
   (Poecile atricapillus; N = 169 individuals, 14 sites) caught along an
   urban gradient to examine individual differences in exploration and
   changes in exploration over time and assays under a reaction-norm
   framework. As predicted, urban birds were significantly faster explorers
   in a novel environment (contacted more features and moved more), however
   urbanization did not predict individual differences in the change in
   exploration over time. Exploration score was moderately repeatable;
   interestingly, urban chickadees were more repeatable in their initial
   exploration behaviors, but seemed less repeatable in how they explored
   over time between assays in comparison to forest birds. Our results
   support the importance of high exploratory tendencies for urban animals,
   and suggest, for the first time, that individuals from urban and
   non-urban habitats differ in the amount of among-individual variation in
   exploration, and thus urban individuals may benefit from diverging more
   from one another in their behavior. Future work should examine the
   extent to which this variation in exploration and plasticity of
   exploration behaviors represent differences in how individuals gather
   information from their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecific individuals often consistently differ in their behavioral
   responses to specific exogenous stimuli. Such individual differences in
   ``personality{''} have been shown to be heritable, suggesting that
   selection maintains variation in personality. However, survival
   selection on a major personality trait, antipredator behavior, and its
   sex-dependency, has been seldom measured in the wild. Here, we found
   that yearling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) showed consistency in
   agitation upon repeated exposure to a restraint-handling protocol,
   probably reflecting antipredator behavior, and that males were more
   agitated than females. Females that exhibited larger antipredator
   behavior were more likely to survive until the next breeding season with
   no variation among 3 study years nor across 7 breeding colonies,
   suggesting that variation in antipredator behavior is not maintained by
   spatiotemporal variation in viability selection on antipredator
   behavior. In both sexes, the intensity of melanin-based ventral plumage
   coloration positively covaried with antipredator behavior, consistent
   with previous observations from diverse vertebrate species. In some barn
   swallow populations, male coloration is targeted by directional
   intersexual selection, suggesting that melanization signals antipredator
   behavior to prospecting females and that sexual selection for
   antipredator behavior, or other correlated personality traits, can drive
   the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in barn swallows. Thus, we
   showed that viability selection occurs on antipredator behavior and that
   spatiotemporal variation in selection has no major role in promoting
   variation in antipredator behavior. More melanized individuals were more
   agitated, implying that melanization may signal personality in a sexual
   communication context in a species where male coloration is an epigamic
   trait.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1494-1501}},

Abstract = {{Consistent among-individual differences in behavior have been described
   in numerous taxa. More recently, the hypothesis that such behavioral
   variation may also correlate to life-history traits, such as investment
   in current or future reproduction, has been proposed as a potential
   explanation for why variation is maintained among and within
   populations. A continual challenge in measuring the integration of these
   traits, or the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS), is to find a reliable and
   quantifiable proxy for energy allocation between reproduction and
   self-maintenance. Here, I address this challenge using the eusocial
   insects, Temnothorax ants, in a common garden experiment to directly
   quantify energy allocation by tracking the number of sterile workers
   (somatic effort) and winged reproductive ants (reproductive effort)
   produced across years. I use colonies collected from populations
   previously demonstrated to show significant differences in a
   risk-tolerance behavioral syndrome. I provide an empirical test of the
   POLS hypothesis between 2 populations of Temnothorax ants over three
   years. I find strong evidence for a POLS between populations and weaker,
   but present support for a within population POLS. More risk-tolerant
   populations also allocate more energy towards reproduction and grow
   faster across years. This study then emphasizes the value of a more
   holistic study of among-individual variation. Additionally, it suggests
   more research is needed on understanding how and why traits may
   correlate in some populations, but remain independent in others.}},

Title = {{Parasite infection and host personality: Glugea-infected three-spined
   sticklebacks are more social}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The existence of animal personality is now well-documented, although the
   causes and consequences of this phenomenon are still largely unclear.
   Parasite infection can have pervasive effects on hosts, including
   altering host behaviour, and may thus contribute to differences in host
   personality. We investigated the relationship between the three-spined
   stickleback and its common parasite Glugea anomala, with focus on
   differences in host personality. Naturally infected and uninfected
   individuals were assayed for the five personality traits activity,
   exploration, boldness, sociability, and aggression. If infected fish
   behaved differently from uninfected, to benefit this parasite with
   horizontal transmission, we predicted behaviour increasing interactions
   with other sticklebacks to increase. Infection status explained
   differences in host personality. Specifically, Glugea-infected
   individuals were more social than uninfected fish. This confirms a link
   between parasite infection and host behaviour, and a relationship which
   may improve the horizontal transmission of Glugea. However, future
   studies need to establish the consequences of this for the parasite, and
   the causality of the parasite-host personality relationship.
   Significance statement
   Parasite infection that alters host behaviour could be a possible avenue
   of research into the causes of animal personality. We studied the link
   between infection and personality using the three-spined stickleback and
   its parasite Glugea anomala. We predicted that infected individuals
   would be more prone to interact with other sticklebacks, since this
   would improve transmission of this parasite. The personality of
   uninfected and naturally infected fish was measured and we observed that
   Glugea-infected sticklebacks were more social. Our results confirm a
   link between parasitism and variation in host personality.}},

Title = {{On the usage of single measurements in behavioural ecology research on
   individual differences}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{99-105}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Since the early 21st century, behavioural ecologists have increasingly
   focused on the ecology and evolution of repeatable individual
   differences in behaviour (aka `animal personality'). More and more
   studies have investigated correlations between behaviour(s) and other
   phenotypic traits, thereby seeking to understand among-individual
   variation in behaviour from either a proximate or an ultimate
   perspective. Statistically, such studies require the estimation of
   among-individual correlations, necessitating study designs where suites
   of labile traits are repeatedly assayed. Most published studies, by
   contrast, instead assume that among-individual correlations can be
   approximated using data of suites of phenotypic traits measured only
   once. Such studies take an `individual gambit' as they assume that
   phenotypic correlations between two traits measured once match
   among-individual correlations. A literature survey shows that this
   assumption was made in 62\% of empirical studies; this is a worrying
   trend as a mismatch between the research question and the study (or
   statistical) design can lead to biased conclusions about biological
   patterns. In this paper we use a visual approach to illustrate these
   concerns for a broad audience, thereby complementing previous papers
   using a jargon more suitable for the statistically oriented. We thereby
   seek to reiterate the notion that reliable answers to any scientific
   question require specific types of data. While this commentary
   underlines the importance of spelling out key assumptions in discussions
   of (suboptimal) data in scientific papers on individuality, our main
   message is that researchers should typically be able to avoid publishing
   studies with conclusions heavily hinging on unverifiable assumptions.
   This is because researchers normally have the freedom to decide a priori
   to focus their research towards questions for which appropriate data can
   arguably be collected. Doing so would greatly facilitate our ability to
   robustly address key questions of biological interest, such as the
   ecology and evolution of individuality. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in
   behavioural profiles correlate to differences in stress-related
   behaviours and hormonal levels in captive brown capuchin monkeys
   (Sapajus libidinosus). Based on a sample of 25 animals, 143 h of
   behavioural data collection and 518 faecal samples, principal component
   analyses indicated the existence of four components that characterize
   the individuals' Genus Normative Behaviour (GNB) (KMO = 0.531, X-2 =
   127.672, p < 0.001): `Feeding', `Sociability', `Exploration', and
   `Activity'. Other four components are related to stress coping styles
   (based on Behaviour Potentially Indicative of Stress - BPIS) (KMO =
   0.550, X-2 = 329.303, p < 0.001): `Self-directed'; `Restless',
   `Ingestion/Self-Scratching', and `Stereotyped'. More active individuals
   exhibit rapid stress-related behaviours (r = 0.443; p = 0.044) while
   less active individuals exhibit more stationary stress-related
   behaviours (r = -0.519; p = 0.013). Akaike information criteria
   indicated that the best linear regression model to predict the
   physiological profile (Faecal Glucocorticoid Metabolites - FGM) included
   three GNB and three BPIS components. `Sociability' (p < 0.05),
   `Exploration' (p < 0.05), and `Ingestion/Self-scratching' (p < 0.05)
   predicted lower FGM levels. `Activity' (p < 0.05), `Self-directed' (p <
   0.05), and `Stereotyped' (p < 0.05) predicted higher FGM levels.
   `Feeding' and `Restless' factors were not included in the models. Our
   results support previous studies indicating that animals within the same
   population differ in the way they behave and react to stressful
   conditions, and these are correlated to different physiological
   profiles. Mapping inter-individual differences in stress coping
   strategies may help clarify the long-term reported incongruity between
   behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare in captive animals,
   supporting better management practices and assisting translational
   models of the development of psychopathologies.}},

Abstract = {{Exploration and activity are often described as trade-offs between the

   potential costs of increasing exposure to predators and parasites. More
   exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of
   parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus
   infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse
   Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration,
   activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized
   individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and
   activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these
   traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M.
   natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality
   types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95\% CI:
   0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of
   age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher
   exploration levels than adults, but lower fieldactivity. There was
   however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these
   2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between
   MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which
   suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to
   MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral
   infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual
   variation in exploration and activity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that personality, defined as consistent
   individual behavioral variation, in farm animals could be an important
   factor when considering their health, welfare, and productivity.
   However, behavioral tests are often performed individually and they
   might not reflect the behavioral differences manifested in every-day
   social environments. Furthermore, the contextual and longer-term
   temporal stability of personality traits have rarely been investigated
   in adult dairy cattle. In this study, we tested three groups of
   lactating Holstein cows (40 cows) using an individual arena test and a
   novel object test in groups to measure the contextual stability of
   behavior. Among the recorded individual test parameters, we used seven
   in the final analysis, which were determined by a systematic parameter
   reduction procedure. We found positive correlations between novel object
   contact duration in the group test and individual test parameters object
   contact duration (R-s = 0.361, P = 0.026) and movement duration (R-s =
   0.336, P = 0.039). Both tests were repeated 6 months later to
   investigate their temporal stability whereby four individual test
   parameters were repeatable. There was no consistency in the group test
   results for 25 cows tested twice, possibly due to group composition
   changes. Furthermore, based on the seven individual test parameters, two
   personality traits (activity/exploration and boldness) were identified
   by principal component analysis. We found a positive association between
   the first and second tests for activity/exploration (R-s = 0.334, P =
   0.058) and for boldness (R-s = 0.491, P = 0.004). Our results support
   the multidimensional nature of personality in adult dairy cattle and
   they indicate a link between behavior in individual and within-group
   situations. The lack of stability according to the group test results
   implies that group companions might have a stronger influence on
   individual behavior than expected. We suggest repeating the within-group
   behavioral measurements to study the relationship between the social
   environment and the manifestation of personality traits in every-day
   situations.}},

Title = {{Effects of acclimatisation on behavioural repeatability in two behaviour
   assays of the guppy Poecilia reticulata}},

Abstract = {{Establishing behavioural repeatability is important in animal
   personality research; however, a range of factors can influence
   repeatability. Experimental design, particularly acclimation time, is
   important in managing a subject's stress prior to the onset of
   behavioural observations. Acclimatisation also ensures we capture normal
   behaviour and promotes consistency in the subject's responses between
   observations. The importance of acclimatisation prior to an assay is
   widely recognised by animal researchers; however, acclimation time
   varies dramatically across personality studies. Here, we investigated
   the effects of acclimatisation time on the repeatability of activity and
   emergence behaviour in feral and domestic populations of lab-reared
   guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Contrary with expectations and previous
   findings, we found highest repeatability in guppy activity levels after
   2h of acclimation to the test arena. In the emergence assay, fish
   exposed to 10min of acclimatisation showed highest repeatability;
   however, all acclimation periods produced high repeatability, suggesting
   that the emergence assay generates robust behavioural responses
   irrespective of acclimation time. The outcomes were broadly consistent
   across both populations. These results show that methodology can impact
   the findings of animal personality research and needs to be considered
   carefully for each assay. We recommend that researchers investigate
   appropriate acclimatisation times for their study species prior to
   commencing research.Significance statementAnimal personality is
   individual differences in behaviour that are maintained through time and
   across contexts. Thus, demonstrating the repeatability of behavioural
   differences between individuals is imperative to establishing animal
   personality. To estimate repeatability, individuals are assessed
   multiple times on the same task to ensure there are consistent
   differences between individuals. When carrying out repeated
   observations, acclimatisation time should be considered to minimise
   stress levels of an animal prior to the behavioural assay. We assessed a
   range of acclimation times on emergence and activity behaviour in two
   populations of guppies. While individual variation in emergence
   behaviour was repeatable across a range of acclimation times, activity
   levels in guppies became significantly more repeatable after 2h of
   acclimatisation. These results show that considering proper acclimation
   time is important when performing behavioural experiments and should be
   properly calibrated by researchers prior to conducting personality
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Cognition is fundamental to animals' lives and an important source of
   phenotypic variation. Nevertheless, research on individual variation in
   animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual
   cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality
   (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies
   have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality
   traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still
   unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an
   important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing
   young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning
   tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality
   assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed
   was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in
   discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with
   personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated
   with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent
   manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than
   less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for
   adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In
   the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning
   speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results
   suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is
   complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further
   investigation of the causality and dynamics of this
   relationship.Significance statementIn the ancestor of today's chickens,
   the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by
   exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and
   personality assays. Our birds differed in personality and learning
   speed, while fast learners in one task did not necessarily learn fast in
   another (i.e., there were no overall smarter birds). Exploration
   correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal
   learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females,
   learned faster, compared to less explorative birds. Other aspects of
   cognition and personality did not correlate. Our results suggest that
   cognition and personality are related, and that the relationship can
   differ depending on task and age of the animal.}},

Title = {{Innovation as part of a wider behavioural syndrome in the guppy: The

Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on animal personalities has shown that individuals within
   populations often differ consistently in various types of behaviour and
   that many of these behaviours correlate among individuals to form
   behavioural syndromes. Individuals of certain species have also been
   shown to differ in their rate of behavioural innovation in arriving at
   novel solutions to new and existing problems (e.g., mazes, novel foods).
   Here, we investigate whether behaviours traditionally studied in
   personality research are correlated with individual rates of innovation
   as part of a wider behavioural syndrome. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
   of both sexes from three different wild population sources were
   assessed: (a) exploration of an open area; (b) speed through a
   three-dimensional maze; (c) investigation of a novel object; and (d)
   attraction to a novel food. The covariance structure (syndrome
   structure) was examined using structural equation modelling. The best
   model separated behaviours relating to activity in all contexts from
   rates of exploration/investigation and innovation. Innovative behaviour
   (utilizing new food and moving through a novel area) in these fish
   therefore forms part of the same syndrome as the traditional shy-bold
   continuum (exploration of an open area and investigation of a novel
   object) found in many animal personality studies. There were no clear
   differences in innovation or syndrome structure between the sexes, or
   between the three different populations. However, body size was
   implicated as part of the behavioural syndrome structure, and because
   body size is highly correlated with age in guppies, this suggests that
   individual behavioural differences in personality/innovation in guppies
   may largely be driven by developmental state.}},

   patterns in the reproductive success of zebrafish (Danio rerio)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in animal personality and external appearance
   such as colouration patterns have both been extensively studied
   separately. A significant body of research has explored many of
   pertinent ecological and biological aspects that can be affected by them
   and their impact upon fitness. Currently little is known about how both
   factors interact and their effect on reproductive success. In this
   study, we evaluated two major parameters contributing to the fitness of
   the species: reproduction and offspring survival. We selected two
   different phenotypes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) selected by their
   colouration patterns: phenotype 1) named Wild type, UAB line (WT-UAB)
   with a homogeneous colouration pattern (clear and defined lateral
   stripes) and phenotype 2) Wild type indefinite (WT-I) had a
   heterogeneous colouration pattern and different degrees of lateral
   stripe definition. All animals were also screened for personality. We
   then compared their reproductive success (spawning rate) and offspring
   survival at different stages, from egg to larvae, and for 2 successive
   generations (parental generation was G0; First and second generations
   were G1 and G2 respectively). Our results show that personality traits
   were the main source of variability between the fitness components
   measured: both personalities had similar total numbers of eggs spawned
   but proactive animals, for both colour phenotypes, had higher
   reproductive success. This was reflected in a higher percentage of
   spawning viability at 1day post fertilization (dpf), higher total
   survival and growth rates at larval stages. Proactive phenotypes from
   WT-UAB population had a higher overall fitness in comparison to the
   other phenotypes studied. Our findings imply that fitness of this
   species when kept under similar husbandry conditions is significantly
   influenced by parental personality and not by their external appearance.
   Under these conditions the reproductive success is enhanced. The
   implications of this study are important for zebrafish breeding and
   husbandry in captivity and are relevant toward understanding the
   underlying drivers of trait selection in natural environments.}},

Title = {{Personality, abnormal behaviour, and health: An evaluation of the
   welfare of police horses}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{An animal's welfare depends on an individual's capacity to adapt to the
   environment in which it lives. This adaptation is directly associated
   with the quality of the environment and to the possibility of expressing
   natural behaviours. Horses kept in stables often display a range of
   abnormal behaviours related to lack of control over their environment,
   which can lead to behavioural and health problems. An individual's
   personality also plays an important role in its susceptibility and
   resilience to the development of diseases and abnormal behaviour; thus,
   an evaluation of horses' personalities could be crucial to selecting
   individuals best able to cope with different work activities. This study
   aimed to assess the well-being of police horses maintained in a
   semi-confinement regime in Brazil by associating their personalities to
   the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and disease. Using a non-invasive
   approach, different tests were performed to investigate the horses'
   behaviour, personality and welfare. A frustration test and a novel
   object test were conducted with 46 horses and the individuals'
   personalities were assessed using questionnaires and behaviour tests. In
   addition, we evaluated their physical health through a survey of their
   veterinary records. The data for horses were evaluated individually. The
   results demonstrated the occurrence of multiple abnormal behaviours
   motivated by factors such as diet and lack of social contact. Moreover,
   the personality tests indicated this is an important component when
   evaluating welfare, since correlations were found between personality
   traits and abnormal behaviour expression, and between personality traits
   and health problems. According to our results, passive, stubborn, and
   confident horses are better suited to be selected as police horses. The
   ability to classify horses according to their personalities could help
   in selecting horses most suitable for patrolling, thereby helping to
   reduce behavioural problems and increasing animal well-being.}},

   ground squirrel}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits overlap in behavioral syndromes that are assumed to
   be related to physiology and life history traits, shaping pace-of-life
   syndromes. Boldness and explorative behavior are frequently associated
   with higher parasite loads, increased resource acquisition, less
   efficient antipredator behavior, and reduced survival (e.g., through
   predation). We explored how personality is related to these biological
   traits using an invasive species-Atlantoxerus getulus in Fuerteventura
   island-as a model system with reduced parasitism and low predation
   pressure. We used breath rate during handling, open field tests, and
   escape trials to test for the existence of interindividual differences
   in boldness, explorative behavior, and escape speed, respectively. We
   also tested whether the personality traits were related and formed
   behavioral syndromes in A. getulus. At the same time, we explored how
   personality is related to ectoparasite load, body condition, and
   survival in the species. We found strong between-individual differences
   in breath rate, readiness to get in the open field arena, and escape
   speed. We found a behavioral syndrome, linking open field entrance and
   escape speed, in A. getulus. However, personality was not related to
   parasite load or body condition and survival was higher for bolder
   individuals. As a whole, our results suggest reduced parasites and
   predator pressures on Fuerteventura may have potentially neutralized the
   typical drawbacks of a fast pace-of-life in the introduced population of
   A. getulus.
   Significance statement
   Research on the interactions of animal personality with other ecological
   and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and selection gradients,
   has yielded some intriguing perspectives about many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. However, our understanding of the
   eco-evolutionary consequences of animal personality and how it interacts
   with other relevant biological processes is still limited. Invasive
   species often experience specific ecological conditions that can allow
   testing of the general assumptions related to animal personality. The
   present contribution explores if and how personality traits are related
   to key ecological and evolutionary factors, such as parasitism and
   survival, in the context of an invasive population subjected to reduced
   parasite and predation pressure. Unlike other studies conducted under
   different ecological contexts, our results suggest Barbary ground
   squirrels from the assessed population with fast pace-of-life syndromes
   have higher survival chances than their counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Studies about personalities in wild animals usually focus on five
   categories of behavioral traits that do not easily accommodate all
   aspects of parental care, a class of behaviors with direct consequence
   to reproductive success. Parental care can vary consistently between
   individuals and constitute parenting styles. Here we investigate the
   consistency of four behaviors of parental care across two breeding
   seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern
   Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest
   defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these
   first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according
   to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and
   aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except
   exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We
   also show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an
   important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can
   arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a
   consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that,
   depending on the parental task, males or females are more consistent,
   suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of parental care
   allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest
   defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more also feed
   the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the
   mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications
   of our results to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking
   parenting styles to fitness in swallow species.}},

Title = {{State-dependent changes in risk-taking behaviour as a result of age and
   residual reproductive value}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{95-100}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animals are able to modify their behaviour in response to changes in
   their internal and environmental state. The asset protection principle
   predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result
   of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would
   incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take
   fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of
   this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of
   RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the
   widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of
   female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various
   points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on
   risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after
   a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open
   arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV
   on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater
   levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby
   offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for
   state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour. (C) 2018 The

Title = {{Mind the trap: large-scale field experiment shows that trappability is
   not a proxy for personality}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{101-112}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural tendencies vary consistently among individuals and this
   variation is known as personality. Previous studies have found that
   personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests
   predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the
   nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only
   within single species and never across environments. This is problematic
   because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between
   seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link
   because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy
   for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this
   would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term
   capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we
   designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and
   trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct
   forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189
   deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes
   gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland
   jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews,
   Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target
   species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality
   traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore,
   trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap
   happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the
   trapping season). Our results suggest that trappability cannot be used
   as a proxy for personality. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Sociable bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, are selectively captured via
   recreational angling}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{129-137}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals often show considerable variance in social behaviour and
   aggression, leading to defined social roles. Removal of individuals with
   particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving
   those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In
   recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk,
   and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social
   structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social
   roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined
   the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To
   address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus,
   a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target
   of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a
   naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish
   was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and
   aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a
   significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status,
   with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a
   transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared
   to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling
   vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance.
   Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more
   likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased
   social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal
   of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of
   social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.

Title = {{The importance of group vocal behaviour in roost finding}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{157-164}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals benefit from socially acquired information to avoid
   predation risks and enhance foraging efficiency. Spix's disc-winged
   bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their
   need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two
   contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls,
   produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats
   within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal
   behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more
   vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent
   individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time
   required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated
   with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting
   a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social
   groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either
   frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling
   rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new
   roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show
   that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost
   called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search
   time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to
   predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more
   roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the
   relevance of more vocal individuals for the group. Our work represents a
   step in understanding the importance of communication and individual
   vocal behaviour in group formation and stability in gregarious animals.

Abstract = {{Variation in intrinsic (body mass, reproductive condition) and extrinsic
   factors (habitat quality, spatio-temporal variation in food
   availability) can affect the costs and benefits of personality traits.
   Relationships between personality and fitness components can vary with
   changes in population density and/or habitat quality. Here, using
   capture-mark-recapture data of individually marked Eurasian red
   squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), we explored whether indices of boldness
   and exploration are correlated with local survival in either of the
   sexes and with a measure of reproductive success in females, under
   different conditions of food availability. PCA scores derived from the
   number of captures (trappability) and number of different traps where an
   individual was captured (trap diversity), in the first 1 or 2 years of
   presence, were used as indices of personality (boldness and pure
   exploration). The relationships between boldness and local survival
   differed between habitats in both sexes. Bold squirrels survived better
   than shy ones in Norway spruce forest, while in the other two study
   areas (Scots pine or mixed spruce-fir forest), survival was lower for
   bolder squirrels. Pure exploration behavior was negatively correlated
   with local survival in all habitats and in both sexes. Female
   reproductive success increased with body mass and decreased with the
   tendency to explore, a relationship consistent across habitat types.
   Bolder females did not have a reproductive advantage in years of poor
   food availability. We suggest that costs and benefits of boldness vary
   with spatio-temporal differences in availability of high-quality food
   resources which may help to maintain variation in personality in red
   squirrels in heterogeneous landscapes.
   Differences in personality among individuals can affect their survival
   or reproductive success. We investigated the relationship between
   personality traits and fitness components in Eurasian red squirrels
   under different food availability. We scored boldness and exploration
   using indices derived from capture-mark-recapture data. Bold red
   squirrels survived longer than shy ones in spruce forest where food
   availability varied strongly between years. Instead, in mixed forests
   with more stable food supplies, shy individuals survived longer. Heavy
   females produced more litters in their lifetime than those with lower
   body mass. Explorative squirrels were more likely to die young and to
   produce no or few litters, independent of the habitat they lived in. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality traits within populations
   of Eurasian red squirrels was maintained by changing fitness benefits in
   relation to habitat type in pulsed resource systems.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in the behavior of prey can influence predation
   risk in complex ways. We ran individual roach (Rutilus rutilus), a
   common freshwater fish, through a standard refuge emergence protocol to
   characterize their boldness, a key animal personality trait. We then
   paired a bold and a shy roach and exposed the pair to one of two
   predator species that have contrasting hunting modes to ascertain how
   personality traits shaped their survival during predator encounters.
   When a paired bold and shy prey fish interacted with a perch predator
   (active foraging mode), bold and shy prey were consumed in almost equal
   numbers. However, pike predators (ambush foraging mode) selectively
   consumed more shy prey, and prey body size and boldness score both
   contributed significantly to which prey fish was eaten. Our findings
   support the idea that multiple predators with different foraging modes,
   and hence differential selection on prey personality, could contribute
   to maintaining variation in personality in prey populations.
   Furthermore, for social species, including shoaling fish, the ultimate
   consequences of an individual's personality may depend upon the
   personality of its nearby conspecifics.
   Animals of the same species often look similar, but individuals show
   differences in their behavior that can have important consequences, for
   instance when these individuals interact with predators. The common
   roach is a freshwater fish that shows inter-individual variation in its
   propensity to take risks, a key personality trait often termed boldness.
   Variation in boldness may affect the outcome when roach interact with
   predators, i.e., if they get eaten or survive. However, we found the
   impact of roachs' personality type depends on what species of predatory
   fish they face. When we put a shy and a bold roach together with
   predatory perch, the roachs' personality did not significantly affect
   which individual was eaten. But when the predator was a pike, the
   predators selectively ate more shy roach, and the likelihood an
   individual would be eaten depended on their body size.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the consequences of consistent individual
   behavioral differences within and between populations. We compared the
   magnitude, repeatability, and plasticity of boldness in the terrestrial
   hermit crab Coenobita compressus in three habitats with different
   degrees of disturbance in Costa Rica. We encourage researchers to test
   additional sites to assess the generality of our results. Boldness
   decreased with crab size at the less disturbed sites, while no
   relationship between size and boldness was found at the disturbed site.
   Boldness increased with habitat disturbance, perhaps because bolder
   crabs succeed in exploiting food around people. Repeatability and
   plasticity were similar across sites. We hypothesize that population
   differences may be the result of developmental plasticity when aquatic
   larvae settle on a beach or selection for boldness at the disturbed site
   acting on each new generation.}},

Abstract = {{Biologists now recognize that ecology can drive evolution, and that
   evolution in turn produces ecological patterns. I extend this thinking
   to include longer time scales, suggesting that macroevolutionary
   transitions can create phenotypic differences among species, which then
   have predictable impacts on species interactions, community assembly and
   ecosystem functioning. Repeated speciation can exacerbate these patterns
   by creating communities with similar phenotypes and hence ecological
   impacts. Here, I use several experiments to test these ideas in
   dragonfly larvae that occupy ponds with fish, ponds without fish, or
   both. I show that macroevolutionary transitions between habitats cause
   fishless pond species to be more active relative to fish pond
   specialists, reducing prey abundance, shifting prey community
   composition and creating stronger trophic cascades. These effects scale
   up to the community level with predictable consequences for ecosystem
   multi-functioning. I suggest that macroevolutionary history can have
   predictable impacts on phenotypic traits, with consequences for
   interacting species and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality traits are defined as consistent individual
   differences in behavior over time and across contexts. Occasionally this
   inflexibility results in maladaptive behavioral responses to external
   stimuli. However, in social groups inflexible behavioral phenotypes
   might be favored as this could lead to more predictable social
   interactions. Two hypotheses seek to describe the optimal distribution
   of personality types within groups. The social niche specialization
   hypothesis states that individuals within groups should partition social
   roles, like personality types, to avoid conflict; whereas the conformity
   hypothesis states that individuals should assort with conspecifics of
   similar personality. However, no research so far has compared these
   hypotheses using data from wild animal systems. We tested boldness in
   the wild on 2 species with different social systems, the Mexican Jay and
   California Scrub-Jay. We found support for the conformity hypothesis
   over the social niche specialization hypothesis because individuals
   within groups of the social species had more similar personalities, and
   consequently there was a statistically significant group effect. The
   most likely mechanism for this conformity is social learning of
   behaviors through development, but more explicit research on this is
   needed.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Habitat choice has broad repercussions for animals, but mechanisms
   influencing such choices are generally not understood. When conducting
   conservation translocations using captive-reared animals, elucidating
   mechanisms influencing habitat preference pre-release could inform
   rearing methods and post-release behavior. We raised 32 captive-born
   eastern box turtles (Terrapene earolina) for eight months-16 in
   naturalistic enriched enclosures and 16 in unenriched enclosures. We
   then let each turtle choose between environments simulating both rearing
   conditions in a novel enclosure to evaluate the hypothesis that rearing
   environment influences habitat selection. Preference for the enriched
   environment was exhibited by enriched (selection probability = 0.81,
   95\% CI: 0.54-0.96) and unenriched (selection probability = 0.88, 95\%
   CI: 0.62-0.98) turtles. Those that chose the enriched habitat (n = 27)
   did so in less than half the time (7 = 504.8 s, 95\% CI: 266.49-743.04)
   than those that selected the unenriched one (n = 5, X = 1339.0 s, 95\%
   CI: 783.84-1894.07, P = 0.009). Selection latency did not differ between
   rearing treatments (P = 0.871). We conducted a second experiment to
   clarify if preferences were based on familiarity or novelty by using the
   same enclosure, but we gave individuals a choice between the habitat
   representing their rearing condition and a novel object (empty tissue
   box). Preference for respective rearing environment was exhibited by
   enriched (selection probability = 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.98) and
   unenriched (selection probability = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.96)
   individuals. Selection latency did not differ based on side chosen (P =
   0.439) or rearing treatment (P = 0.764). Selection latency was
   repeatable by individuals (R = 0.47, 90\% CI = 0.24-0.71, P = 0.003),
   and this personality trait may be heritable since it was also repeatable
   by clutch mates (R = 0.36, 90\% CI = 0.03-0.62, P = 0.001). Preference
   for a naturalistic environment by captive-born eastern box turtles
   appears to be driven by an innate mechanism rather than based on prior
   experience. Housing this species in enriched enclosures should increase
   welfare. Moreover, our collective findings highlight the importance of
   evaluating how intrinsic effects could affect translocation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (i.e., POLS) hypothesis posits that behavioral
   and physiological traits mediate the trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. This hypothesis predicts that life history,
   behavioral, and physiological traits will covary under clearly defined
   conditions. Empirical tests are equivocal and suggest that the
   conditions necessary for the POLS to emerge are not always met. We
   nuance and expand the POLS hypothesis to consider alternative
   relationships among behavior, physiology, and life history. These
   relationships will vary with the nature of predation risk, the
   challenges posed by resource acquisition, and the energy management
   strategies of organisms. We also discuss how the plastic response of
   behavior, physiology, and life history to changes in ecological
   conditions and variation in resource acquisition among individuals
   determine our ability to detect a fast-slow pace of life in the first
   place or associations among these traits. Future empirical studies will
   provide most insights on the coevolution among behavior, physiology, and
   life history by investigating these traits both at the genetic and
   phenotypic levels in varying types of predation regimes and levels of
   resource abundance.
   We revisit the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, suggesting that
   behaviors involving a risk of death or injury should coevolve with
   higher metabolic rates, higher fecundity, faster growth, and heightened
   mortality rates. Empirical support for this hypothesis is mixed. We show
   how relaxing some of the assumptions underlying the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis allows us to consider alternative relationships
   among behavior, physiology, and life history, and why we fail to meet
   the predictions posed by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis in some
   populations. Our discussion emphasizes the need to re-integrate the role
   of the species' natural history, ecological conditions, and phenotypic
   plasticity in shaping relationships among behavior, physiology, and life
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental variation strongly influences individual life histories,
   behavior, and immunity. For many animals living in non-tropical regions,
   environmental variation due to season is very important and can be
   reliably predicted by photoperiod. By manipulating the pre- and
   post-natal photoperiod for cavies (Cavia aperea), we simulated different
   birth seasons that go along with predictable differences in life
   history. Offspring born into simulated spring conditions mature earlier,
   indicating a fast pace of life compared to offspring born into simulated
   fall. We investigated the development of two innate (titers of natural
   antibodies and complement) and one adaptive (immunoglobulin G) immune
   effectors across multiple life stages. In addition, we tested if three
   behaviors, indicating risk-taking and stress-coping, differed between
   seasons. Finally, we tested if behaviors and immune traits correlate
   with each other as predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis.
   The season of birth influenced average trait expression of both immunity
   and behavior. Boldness, indicating risk-taking behavior, correlated
   positively with the titers of natural antibodies, fitting the
   predictions of the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS). However, fearlessness,
   indicating how an individual copes with a stressful situation,
   correlated positively with immunoglobulin G concentrations, against the
   predictions of the POLS. Together, our results show that behaviors and
   immune traits react to differences in expected life histories, but do
   not show the predicted covariation. We conclude that proximate
   mechanisms and different functions of traits need to be considered to
   predict the nature of behavior-immune associations.
   Individual life histories, behavior, and immunity are strongly
   influenced by the environment individual's experience during early life.
   Recent theory predicts correlations between behavior and immunity to
   arise as a consequence of different life histories. By simulating
   different birth seasons, we induced different life history expectations
   as well as a season-dependent development of immunity and behavior.
   However, correlations between behavior and immunity do not fit
   theoretical predictions, highlighting the need for more detailed theory.}},

Title = {{Top predator's aggressiveness and mesopredator's risk-aversion
   additively determine probability of predation}},

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions strongly affect ecological dynamics.
   Consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour (individual
   behavioural types, BTs) of predator and prey (or both) may fundamentally
   shape their mutual interactions. Several recent studies have shown that
   it is important to consider the interaction of BTs on both sides of
   predator-prey interactions. Otherwise, there is a high risk of erroneous
   inference about the outcome of predation. Until now, however, no study
   has investigated how BT vs BT interaction affects the predation of
   mesopredators by top predators, especially when the mesopredator is a
   low-ranked prey for the top predator. Such knowledge is extremely
   important if we want to predict the effect of individual BTs on food web
   dynamics. We have investigated in our laboratory experiments how
   foraging aggressiveness of the top predator (spider, Philodromus
   cespitum, Philodromidae) and risk-aversion as a form of shyness of the
   mesopredator (spider, Philodromus albidus, Philodromidae) determine the
   probability of predation. The highest explanatory power had the model
   with additive effects of mesopredator's risk-aversion and top predator's
   foraging aggressiveness. Other models, including those with BT vs BT
   interaction, had poor explanatory power. It was probably due to the fact
   that timid top predators are often choosy and do not catch low-ranked
   prey, while aggressive top predators are opportunists. The risk-averse
   mesopredators are also more cautious than risk-prone mesopredators
   regarding their surroundings and can defend themselves faster. Our
   results therefore fit with the classical hypothesis about trade-off
   between foraging and safety.
   Behavioural types of predator and prey jointly determine the mortality
   of prey. In our laboratory experiments, we investigated how foraging
   aggressiveness of a top predator spider and the risk-aversion of a
   mesopredator spider (potential prey) determine the probability of
   predation. We demonstrated that top predator's foraging aggressiveness
   and mesopredator's risk-aversion determine the probability of
   mesopredator's mortality only additively. The mesopredator's probability
   of being killed decreased with its risk-aversion and increased with top
   predator's foraging aggressiveness. The effect was additive instead of
   interactive because the mesopredator represents a dangerous prey for the
   top predator. The timid top predators are also choosy and do not attack
   dangerous prey, while the aggressive/non-choosy top predators are
   opportunistic. Further, the risk-averse mesopredators are more cautious
   regarding their surroundings and can react faster to the presence of a
   top predator, compared to risk-prone and slowly reacting mesopredators.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits are related to many aspects of one's life, including
   risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive
   substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and
   behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio).
   To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles:
   bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence
   test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and
   were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior)
   following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were
   0.0\%, 0.1\% and 0.5\% (v/v\%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters
   evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance
   traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or
   exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0\%
   alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish.
   However, 0.5\% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal,
   while both 0.1\% and 0.5\% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our
   results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected
   differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to
   behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish
   as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social
   behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the encountering of a predator always being extremely
   threatening, there is a significant plasticity among individuals in how
   they cope with such a situation. In laboratory experiments with
   wild-caught great tits (Parus major), we tested the effect of
   exploratory behaviour (performance in novel food, object and environment
   test, startle test) on the ability of individual birds to assess the
   threat represented by a predator. We presented a wooden dummy of the
   European sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), an extremely dangerous predator,
   and its visual modifications (chimeras), changing the beak or head to be
   non-threatening (those of a pigeon - Columba Livia f domestica). We
   showed that the differences between `slow' and `fast explorers' are not
   very distinct, but that `slow explorers' generally tended to be more
   cautious in the presence of an unmodified sparrowhawk dummy, while the
   `fast explorers' tended to observe the dummy. On the contrary, `slow
   explorers' tended to treat both chimaeras (and the pigeon dummy as well)
   as less-threatening than `fast explorers'. Since `slow explorers' are
   usually considered to be more sensitive to environmental cues, it came
   as no surprise that most of them correctly assessed the unmodified
   sparrowhawk dummy as threatening, while they probably subjected the
   chimeras to a detailed inspection and were not confused by the presence
   of sparrowhawk features and assessed them as non-threatening.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Animal `personality', the phenomenon of consistent individual
   differences in behaviour within populations, has been documented widely,
   yet its functional significance and the reasons for its persistence
   remain unclear. One possibility is that among-individual behavioural
   variation is linked to fitness-determining traits via effects on
   resource acquisition. In this study, we tested this idea, using rockpool
   prawns, Palaemon elegans, to test for a correlation between `high-risk
   exploration' and the ability to monopolize a limited resource. Modified
   open field trials (OFTs) confirmed that consistent among-individual
   (co)variation in high-risk exploratory behaviours does exist in this
   species, and multivariate analysis showed trait variation is consistent
   with a major axis of personality variation. Subsequent feeding trials in
   size-matched groups where competition was possible revealed a high
   repeatability of feeding duration, used here as a proxy for RHP
   (resource-holding potential). We found significant negative correlations
   between feeding duration and two `risky' behaviours, such that
   individuals that took fewer risks fed more. Our results are not
   consistent with the widely hypothesized idea of a `proactive syndrome'
   in which bolder, risk-taking personalities are positively associated
   with RHP. Rather they suggest the possibility of a trade-off, with some
   individuals successful at monopolizing limited, high-value resources,
   while others are more willing to engage in potentially risky exploration
   (which may increase the likelihood of encountering novel resource
   patches). We speculate that alternative strategies for acquiring limited
   resources might thereby contribute to the maintenance of personality
   variation observed in wild populations. (C) 2018 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Wild animals show consistent individual variation in behavior across
   time and/or contexts, now referred to as animal personality. While this
   variability may have important ecological and evolutionary implications,
   how and why variation in animal personality is maintained in a natural
   population remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the influence of
   environmental and biological sources of variation on behavioral
   responses measured along the shy-bold continuum in a long-lived,
   iteroparous marine mammal, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus). Between
   2008 and 2016, 469 females from the Sable Island, Nova Scotia breeding
   colony of gray seals were given a boldness score in response to a human
   approach, designed to stimulate maternal defense of offspring. Using
   generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework,
   we show that boldness is highly repeatable between and within years.
   There were age differences in boldness, with younger females being less
   bold than older, more experienced females providing some support for the
   life history trade-off hypothesis. We further used GLMMs to assess
   sources of variation on offspring weaning mass. We found that young
   females that were bolder produced heavier pups than shyer counterparts,
   and that pups produced by bolder females were on average 2 kg heavier
   than pups of shy females. These results provide further evidence that
   personality influences life history strategies, and illustrates the
   evolutionary potential of animal personality in response to selection.
   Consistent individual differences in behavior influence various aspects
   of ecology including species interactions, species distributions, and
   life history strategies. However, how and why this individual variation
   is maintained in a natural population remains uncertain. In this study,
   we assessed the influence of boldness, specifically maternal defense of
   offspring, on a component of reproductive success in a long-lived marine
   mammal. We showed highly repeatable behavioral differences, and found
   that boldness varied with age, with younger individuals being less bold
   than older individuals. Younger individuals that were bolder produced
   heavier offspring than shyer counterparts. Our study contributes to an
   under-represented group of animals, wild marine mammals, in the
   personality literature, and further prompts the investigation into the
   proximate and ultimate factors influencing personality in an
   ecologically important marine predator.}},

Abstract = {{Trait impulsivity is an increasingly relevant topic for human and
   non-human animal personality research. There are similarities in dog and
   human manifestations of trait impulsivity at the behavioural, genetic,

   Owners reported their dogs' dispositional behaviour on the DIAS, an RST
   scale modified to describe dogs' behaviour, and a list of common dog
   behaviour problems. In a sample of 730 dogs, we observed convergence
   between the RST and the DIAS. There was a negative correlation between

   were both distinct from other factors. However, the DIAS `Aggression and
   response to novelty' factor and the RST FFFS explained different aspects
   of dog behaviour problems. Importantly, whilst the DIAS factors
   indicated tendencies towards avoidant behaviours, the FFFS discriminated
   between active and passive avoidance. The findings suggest a partial
   overlapping between the DIAS and RST scales, and highlights the utility
   of personality models in investigating behaviour problems in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal
   personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked
   whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions
   similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent
   across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish
   (Gambusia affinis) as our study organism, we characterized focal
   individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and
   sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral
   repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two
   different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between
   computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in
   body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different
   effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than
   average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with
   increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive
   personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher
   shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming
   females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of
   preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may
   reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social
   dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for
   assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the
   existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals' choosiness across mate
   choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our
   present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of
   personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioral syndromes can have profound effects on
   individual fitness. Consequently, there is growing recognition that
   knowledge of these phenomena may assist with animal conservation. Here
   we review evidence for personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians (the most threatened vertebrate class), critique experimental
   approaches, and explore whether knowledge in this domain might assist
   with endangered species management. Despite being a neglected field
   (research has spanned just 24 species), there is emerging evidence that
   frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts show personality and behavioral
   syndromes along three behavioral axes: boldness, exploration, and
   activity. Among vertebrates, amphibians are unique in having a biphasic
   lifecycle defined by metamorphosis and obvious transformations in
   morphology, physiology, and habitat use, characteristics that enable
   detailed examination of behavioral changes across life stages and
   ecological contexts. Accordingly, recent work has started to make
   important contributions to our understanding of the development and
   proximate causes of personality and behavioral syndromes, with some
   emerging evidence for ontogenetic stability, genetic control, and
   state-dependent personality. To date, however, no study has considered
   the conservation implications of personality for amphibians. Drawing on
   a conceptual framework and empirical literature for all vertebrates, we
   argue that there is considerable potential for knowledge of animal
   personality to improve amphibian conservation programs. We propose a
   novel paradigm to improve (i) the mating and reproductive success of
   captive animals by ensuring that breeding pairs are behaviorally
   compatible and (ii) the post-reintroduction survival and reproductive
   potential of animals by facilitating the selection of optimal behavioral
   types for release.
   Significance statement
   Animal personality and behavioral syndromes appear to be widespread in
   nature. Here, we review animal personality and behavioral syndromes in
   amphibians, an understudied taxonomic group within the field. We
   summarize evidence, critique methodological approaches used, and
   emphasize that the unique behavioral ecology of amphibians makes them a
   model group for studying the proximate causes and ecological
   consequences of personality and behavioral syndromes. We also highlight
   that knowledge of these phenomena may have significant conservation
   implications for amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of phenotypic behavioral correlations and their connection
   to fitness consequences of organisms have received considerable debate
   within the literature. Yet, little work has been carried out to connect
   any behavioral correlates found within a set of laboratory studies to
   natural behavior observed under complex environmental conditions. To
   help fill this gap, individual crayfish, collected from the same local
   population, completed five different behavioral assays in a laboratory
   setting in a random order. These data were used to reveal any possible
   correlations for behavioral scores across all of the laboratory tests.
   Subsequently, these same individuals were placed into the field and
   video recorded for 24hr. A separate set of field behaviors, related to
   the laboratory assays, were quantified from the field videos. The
   normalized laboratory and field behaviors were used in three stepwise
   statistical analyses. First, normalized data were loaded into a PCA to
   generate a priori hypotheses on potential behavioral correlates. These
   hypotheses were subsequently tested using general multiple linear
   regression. Finally, structural equation modeling was performed to
   elucidate any behavioral modules from the laboratory assays that
   correlated with behavioral patterns present from the fieldwork. Three
   laboratory-based behavioral modules were connected to three separate
   field assays: exploration-avoidance, bold-shy, and aggressiveness. Yet,
   some behaviors exhibited in the laboratory assays were uncorrelated with
   any behaviors found in the field and vice versa. Results from this study
   provide evidence that although many different behavioral correlates may
   exist within laboratory settings, these same modules may not translate
   directly into predicting behavior under natural settings.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals frequently show long-term consistency in behaviour over
   their lifetimes, referred to as personality. Various models, revolving
   around the use of resources and how they are valued by individuals,
   attempt to explain the maintenance of these different behavioural types
   within a population, and evaluating them is the key for understanding
   the evolution of behavioural variation. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from
   divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking
   individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of
   wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and
   related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual
   reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make
   divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking
   behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as
   condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness
   to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets
   (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire
   adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome
   influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to
   willingness to leave the shelter and activity. Crickets did not appear
   to protect their assets however, as estimates of residual reproductive
   value were not related to behaviour. Although there was considerable
   variance attributed to the short-term consistency, neither trait was
   affected by phenotypic condition, failing to support either of the
   models we tested. Our study confirms that behaviours may covary with
   some life-history traits and highlights the scales of temporal
   consistency that are more difficult to explain.}},

Title = {{Plasticity in extended phenotype increases offspring defence despite
   individual variation in web structure and behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals actively defend their offspring using a range of behaviours
   from calling and mobbing in birds, to physical grappling in crustaceans,
   and the expression of these behaviours positively scale with offspring
   value. While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very
   little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of
   architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to
   offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent
   individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely
   unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We
   addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti,
   by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour
   and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative
   reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web
   structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of
   web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase.
   Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g.
   eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the
   variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of
   individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation
   drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits,
   suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in
   defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended
   phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in
   some taxa. Furthermore, individual variation in these traits suggest
   that different reproductive strategies may exist, whereby some
   individuals invest more in reproduction at a cost to safety/foraging and
   vice versa. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {{Inbreeding affects personality and fitness of a leaf beetle}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation, which are mostly anthropogenically
   caused, can lead to decreasing population sizes for many species.
   Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression
   can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in
   inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on
   fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon
   cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural
   phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by
   inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression
   both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice
   during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is,
   activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent
   across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles
   differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were
   affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age.
   Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment
   than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in
   specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they
   reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits,
   the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected
   by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and
   thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased
   fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals
   might affect the further development and survival of populations and
   thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the
   ecosystem. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social
   environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of
   behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects
   that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male
   Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the
   effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual
   signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness,
   activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation.
   Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic
   sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and
   explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted
   in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of
   changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that
   mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The
   effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were
   far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social
   environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between
   behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the
   average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets
   were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets
   becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the
   nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations
   between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social
   environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our
   current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on
   behaviour. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{Personality variation in two predator species does not impact prey

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests that consistent individual differences in
   behavior, better known as animal personality, can shape aspects of
   population and community ecology. Yet, the potential for animal
   personality to affect more complex and non-linear food webs, like those
   seen in nature, remains understudied. Here, we explore the degree to
   which the aggregate behaviors of two predator species simultaneously
   interact to alter prey survival rates and the presence and magnitude of
   trophic cascades. We set up mesocosms in an old-field habitat containing
   four different insect prey species and either two Phidippus clarus
   (Salticidae), two Platycryptus undatus (Salticidae), or one of each
   predator. Prior to initiating each mesocosm, we assayed the activity
   level and boldness of each individual predator and included these
   metrics in our models predicting prey survival and plant damage. We then
   compared the number of surviving prey and plant damage under each of
   these conditions and tested for associations between each of these
   response variables and predator behavior. We found no significant effect
   of predator community composition or predators' behavior on prey
   survival or plant damage. These results suggest that the effects of
   predator personality on prey survival may be subtle or absent in complex
   species interaction modules.
   Significance statement
   Although much research suggests that animal personality can influence
   broader scale ecological phenomena, the ability of animal personality to
   alter complex species interaction modules remains unresolved. We tested
   whether pairs of predators of different personality types differentially
   impacted prey survival rates and plant damage in a tritrophic system,
   and whether these effects varied based on predator community
   composition. We recovered no evidence that predator personality types
   influenced prey survival or plant damage regardless of the predator
   composition considered. These results suggest that the effects of
   personality may be absent or undetectable in more complex, realistic
   ecological settings. The majority of laboratory-based personality
   studies published to date evaluate only dyadic species interactions in
   simplified environments. Our findings therefore raise concerns that such
   studies are prone to overestimate the effects of animal personality.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{52-58}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The neural constraint hypothesis is central to understanding
   decision-making by foraging herbivorous insects which make decisions
   less efficiently when they face multiple choices for numerous resource
   types and/or at high densities instead of a fewer choices. Previous
   studies have also shown the relationship between personality type and
   decision-making style. How personality types correlate with foraging
   efficiency among herbivores is however, largely untested. To answer this
   question, we used a widespread, polyphagous, floriphilic katydid,
   Phaneroptera brevis (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) and two naturalised,
   Asteraceae, food plants, Bidens pilosa and Sphagneticola trilobata, as
   model systems. After we determined each katydid's exploration and
   boldness levels, we examined its foraging efficiency across different
   combinations of floral resource choice and density. We showed: (1) For
   the first time within the Tettigonioidea lineage that this katydid
   exhibits different personality types in exploration and boldness. (2)
   Contrary to our prediction, we did not find any support for the neural
   constraint hypothesis because more floral resource choice at a high
   density did not reduce foraging efficiency. (3) Surprisingly, bold
   katydids tend to be less efficient foragers than shy ones. Our findings
   have enhanced understanding of herbivore behavioural ecology and
   knowledge to better deal with potential pest herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal life-history strategies are currently considered to be a major
   driving force for the maintenance of animal personalities. In this
   experimental study we tested whether naturally occurring predation
   causes personality dependent mortality of a marine isopod (Idotea
   balthica), which could maintain personality variation in nature.
   Moreover, as isopods are known to have sex-differences in behaviour, we
   were interested in whether personality-dependent predation was
   sex-specific. We also hypothesised that predation pressure among
   personality types could vary according to habitat type, as it has been
   shown in correlative studies that habitat may influence personality
   variation. We used natural predator (European perch Perca fluviatilis)
   of I. balthica and studied relative mortality of males and females with
   a different personality types in laboratory settings with two different
   habitats. We found that survival in males was lower than in females for
   high active individuals. Moreover, survival under predation was linked
   to body size differently in females and males. This, however, depended
   on personality class as larger size was advantageous for low-active
   males and middle- and high-active females. Conversely, smaller size was
   advantageous for low-active females and middle-active males. Size did
   not affect survival in high-active males. Our results suggest that
   predation can encourage life-history differences between sexes leading
   to different optimal life-history strategies and also maintains
   consistent activity for both sexes.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the ways in which individuals cope with threats, respond
   to challenges, make use of opportunities and mediate the harmful effects
   of their surroundings is important for predicting their ability to
   function in a rapidly changing world. Perhaps one of the most essential
   drivers of coping behaviour of adults is the environment experienced
   during their early-life development. Although the study of coping,
   defined as behaviours displayed in response to environmental challenges,
   has a long and rich research history in biology, recent literature has
   repeatedly pointed out that the processes through which coping
   behaviours develop in individuals are still largely unknown. In this
   review, we make a move towards integrating ultimate and proximate lines
   of coping behaviour research. After broadly defining coping behaviours
   (1), we review why, from an evolutionary perspective, the development of
   coping has become tightly linked to the early-life environment (2),
   which relevant developmental processes are most important in creating
   coping behaviours adjusted to the early-life environment (3), which
   influences have been shown to impact those developmental processes (4)
   and what the adaptive significance of intergenerational transmission of
   coping behaviours is, in the context of behavioural adaptations to a
   fast changing world (5). Important concepts such as effects of parents,
   habitat, nutrition, social group and stress are discussed using examples
   from empirical studies on mammals, fish, birds and other animals. In the
   discussion, we address important problems that arise when studying the
   development of coping behaviours and suggest solutions.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Variation in life history (LH) traits along the fast-slow continuum
   (referred to as pace of life, POL) is thought to result from a trade-off
   between investments in current versus future reproduction. Originally
   developed for understanding variation in LH strategies at the
   among-population level, the POL theory has more recently been applied
   towards understanding variation in LH traits at the within-population
   level, and further extended to address the covariance of LH traits with
   additional behavioural and/or physiological traits, referred to as
   pace-of-life syndromes (POLS). The article by Reale et al. (Philos T Roy
   Soc B 365: 4051-4063, 2010), which synthesized several earlier reviews
   and opinions on among-individual covariation between LH, behavioural,
   and physiological traits, and subsequent research testing POLS in a
   variety of species, have collectively been cited several hundreds of
   times-a trend that continues. These works have interdisciplinary impact,
   informing research in life history biology, behavioural and
   developmental biology, and the social sciences. In this paper, we review
   the existing theoretical POLS models that provide adaptive explanations
   for covariances between LH traits and additional behavioural and/or
   physiological traits while assuming a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. We find that the set of relevant models is small.
   Moreover, models show that covariances between life history traits and
   behavioural or physiological traits can arise even in the absence of a
   current-future reproduction trade-off, implying that observing such
   covariances does not provide a strong indication regarding the process
   generating POLS. We discuss lessons learned from existing models of
   POLS, highlight key gaps in the modelling literature, and provide
   guidelines for better integration between theory and data.}},

Title = {{Paceless life? A meta-analysis of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts that individual
   differences in behavior should integrate with morphological,
   physiological, and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. For example, individuals with a ``slow{''} pace-of-life are
   expected to exhibit a slower growth rate, delayed reproduction, longer
   lifespans, have stronger immune responses, and are expected to avoid
   risky situations relative to ``fast{''} individuals. If supported, this
   hypothesis would help resolve ecological and evolutionary questions
   regarding the origin and maintenance of phenotypic variation. Support
   for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has, however, been mixed. Here,
   we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 articles and 179 estimates testing
   the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis as it applies to the integration of
   behaviors with physiological or life-history traits. We found little
   overall support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis with the mean
   support estimated as r = 0.06. Support for the pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis was significantly higher in invertebrates (r = 0.23) than
   vertebrates (r = 0.02) and significantly higher when based on phenotypic
   (r = 0.10) versus genetic correlations (r = -0.09). We also found that
   females exhibited correlations between behavior and life-history and
   physiology that were opposite the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis (r = -0.16) and that these correlations
   significantly differed from those observed in males (r = 0.01) or males
   and females pooled (r = 0.12). It was also the case that there was
   little support for the hypothesis when life-history and physiological
   traits were independently analyzed (behavior x life-history: r = 0.12;
   behavior x physiology: r = 0.04). Exploratory post hoc analyses revealed
   that correlations of behavior with growth rate and hormone levels were
   more likely to show support for the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis. The lack of overall support found in our analyses
   suggests that general assertions regarding phenotypic integration due to
   ``pace-of-life{''} should be re-evaluated.
   Significance statement
   The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has been proposed as an overall
   organizational framework for the integration of behavioral,
   life-history, and physiological traits. This hypothesis provides
   potentially profound insights into how and why phenotypic traits might
   covary and why phenotypic variation may be maintained within
   populations. Over the last 7 years, this organizational framework has
   been intensively investigated as it pertains to relationships between
   behavior and other traits. Here, we conducted an overall analysis of
   whether the hypothesis was supported. Despite considerable research
   investment across behavioral ecology, we did not find that available
   data supported the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. This suggests that
   either the hypothesis has been inappropriately tested or is not
   generally applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral responses of male fowl did not depend on social rank after 3
   weeks in stable groups, but were consistent over time for an individual.
   Theory suggests that stable social states, for example, stable social
   hierarchies, may lead to consistent variation in behavior, that is,
   variation in personality. Our results suggest that variation in
   personality is not a consequence of variation in social status and that
   personality is more important than current social position in
   determining individual behavior in stable groups.Individuals often
   differ in behavior in a consistent way, that is, they show variation in
   personality. Understanding the processes explaining the emergence and
   maintenance of this variation is a current major topic in the field of
   animal behavioral research. Recent theoretical models predict that
   differences in various ``states{''} can generate individual variation in
   behavior. Previous studies have mainly focused on endogenous states like
   metabolic rate or energy reserves, but theory also suggests that states
   based on social interactions could play important roles in shaping
   personality. We have earlier demonstrated short-term status-dependent
   variation in behavior in the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus),
   but whether such behavioral variation remains also after a longer period
   of time, is unknown. Therefore, we examine the influence of social
   status on variation in behavior, using experimental manipulation of
   social status in pairs of male domestic fowl. We scored males in 3
   personality assays (novel arena test, novel object test, and aggression
   test) before and after 3 weeks in pairs as either dominant or
   subordinate. We observed individual consistency of behavior despite
   alteration of social status. We further found no support for social
   status acting as a state that generates variation in personality over
   the used time interval: social status had no significant effect on the
   change in behavioral responses between repeated personality tests. Our
   results suggest that personality is more important than current social
   situation for describing individual behavior in stable groups.}},

Title = {{The fast and the flexible: cognitive style drives individual variation
   in cognition in a small mammal}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{119-132}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of individual differences in cognition have been studied
   empirically and systematically in the last decade, but causes and
   consequences of this variation are still largely unclear. A recent
   hypothesis suggests that one predictor of individual variation in
   cognition is personality, and specifically that personality types are
   linked to cognitive styles through a speed-accuracy trade-off. We tested
   specific predictions of this hypothesis, measuring individual
   differences in associative learning speed and flexibility, quantified
   via reversal learning, of 86 bank voles, Myodes glareolus, along with
   their activity and boldness. We found that bolder and more active
   individuals were fast, inflexible and persistent in the associative
   learning tasks, whereas shyer and less active individuals were slow and
   flexible. We also found evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off: correct
   choices in the cognitive tasks required more time for all individuals
   compared to incorrect choices, but bolder, more active voles always made
   their decisions faster than reactive ones. The difference between the
   time required for a correct and an incorrect choice was most pronounced
   in initial learning for shyer and less active individuals, but for
   bolder, more active individuals it was most pronounced in the reversal
   learning task. We also found differences related to sex and age: females
   were faster than males to update information or correct incorrect
   choices and older animals took longer to initiate the test. Our results
   confirm the hypothesis that individual differences in behaviour are
   reflected in different `cognitive styles', differentially trading off
   speed for flexibility and accuracy in cognitive tasks. Moreover, we
   provide the first evidence for the mechanisms of such a trade-off in a
   small mammal. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Consistent individual differences and population plasticity in
   network-derived sociality: An experimental manipulation of density in a
   gregarious ungulate}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In many taxa, individual social traits appear to be consistent across
   time and context, thus meeting the criteria for animal personality. How
   these differences are maintained in response to changes in population
   density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates.
   Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how
   among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured
   using social network analyses, change as a function of population
   density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated
   into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females
   were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded
   social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting
   radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic
   association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective
   of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and
   degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social
   connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual
   variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals
   oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in
   density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate
   density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing
   density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social
   connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher
   density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social
   benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study
   illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a
   density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity.
   Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density
   dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent
   individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in
   other ecological processes ( e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice,
   disease transfer).}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals
   alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in
   `personality'evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the
   integration of `intrinsic state' and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones,
   energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed
   as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically
   or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis
   estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour
   attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that
   only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level
   associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our
   meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative
   and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone
   levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of
   among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was
   nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive
   explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual
   variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear,
   additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii)
   explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv)
   empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were
   inappropriate. Our meta-analysis highlights the importance of feedback
   between empiricists and theoreticians in the study of adaptive

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing individual variation in parental care is critical to
   understanding how selection shapes and maintains patterns of care, yet
   little is known about how individual parents vary in their responses to
   the environment. Reaction norms, functions that describe how phenotypes
   change across an environmental gradient, provide an elegant framework
   for studying individual variation in behavioural responses. We use a
   reaction norm approach to investigate how studying plasticity, which
   describes variation within an individual through time, and personality,
   which describes repeatable variation among individuals, together explain
   individual variation in the parental behaviour of the anemonefish
   Amphiprion percula. More specifically, we test how resource availability
   influences individual parental responses to the environment and discuss
   the consequences for our understanding of plasticity and personality in
   parental care. Breeding pairs of A. percula were fed either a high or a
   low food ration and their parental behaviours were monitored.
   Individuals exhibited plasticity in parental behaviour across the two
   resource environments. Furthermore, individuals were repeatable in their
   behaviour through time, as evidenced by significant among-individual
   variation in intercept. Finally, the slope and elevation of individual
   reaction norms varied, revealing a level of variation not captured at
   the population level and providing insight into the potential mechanisms
   generating individual variation. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{We describe a conceptual framework integrating animal personalities,
   movement ecology, social networks and parasite transmission. For
   directly transmitted parasites, parasite transmission depends on social
   interaction patterns that can be quantified using social network
   metrics. For indirectly transmitted parasites, the key can be
   transmission networks that quantify time-lagged contacts (e.g. where
   potential hosts visit locations used earlier by infected hosts). Social
   network connections (time-lagged or not) often result from shared space
   use determined by individual movements in response to key environmental
   factors. Movement ecology provides a framework for understanding these
   responses. Finally, individuals with different personalities likely
   respond differently to environmental factors in ways that influence the
   movements and space use that underlie network connectivity, which, in
   turn, affects parasite loads and transmission. We illustrate these key
   points with recent work on sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their
   ticks. By GPS tracking of nearly all adult lizards at our site, we found
   that lizards that more frequently shared the same refuges (where ticks
   detach and reattach to a new host) used earlier by other lizards tended
   to indeed have higher tick loads. Higher shared refuge use was
   associated with greater shared space use, in general. Shared space use
   with conspecifics was reduced by the lizards' general propensity
   (quantified by analyses of 279 985 GPS locations for 72 lizards) to
   avoid conspecifics, but enhanced by their general tendency to prefer
   areas with more resources and better refuge (in particular, late in the
   season when food was scarce and conditions were hotter and drier). Both
   of these tendencies were personality dependent. Less aggressive lizards
   exhibited both a stronger attraction to areas with more food and better
   refuge, and a stronger tendency to avoid other lizards. We conclude by
   discussing implications of our results for the general conceptual
   framework and suggest future directions. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

   social personalities in lemurs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{217-226}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Group members interact with each other during multiple social behaviours
   that range from aggressive to affiliative interactions. It is not known,
   however, whether an individual's suite of social behaviours consistently
   covaries through time and across different types of social interactions.
   Consistent social behaviour would be advantageous in groups, especially
   when individuals need to remember their group members' social roles and
   preferences in order to keep track of social relationships and predict
   conspecifics' future behaviour. Here, we address whether social
   behaviour of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, is consistent through time
   and across four interaction networks (aggression, grooming, contact
   calling, scent marking). We quantified variation in social behaviour
   through four network centrality measures including outdegree,
   outstrength, betweenness and eigenvector centrality. Comparing lemurs'
   measures across 2 years revealed that network centrality remained
   consistent between years. Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent
   across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one
   interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even
   when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus,
   regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and
   frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and
   responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had
   preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years
   and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently
   responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics
   they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that
   individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific,
   but instead persists through time and across multiple social
   interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social
   personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles,
   including how socially active they are and with whom they interact. (C)

Abstract = {{Consistent differences in behavior between individuals, otherwise known
   as animal personalities, have become a staple in behavioral ecology due
   to their ability to explain a wide range of phenomena. Social organisms
   are especially serviceable to animal personality techniques because they
   can be used to explore behavioral variation at both the individual and
   group level. Despite the success of personality research in social
   organisms generally, and social Hymenoptera in particular, social wasps
   (Vespidae) have received little to no attention in the personality
   literature. In the present study, we test Polistes metricus (Vespidae;
   Polistinae) paper wasp queens for the presence of repeatable variation
   in, and correlations ({''}behavioral syndromes{''}) between, several
   commonly used personality metrics: boldness, aggressiveness,
   exploration, and activity. Our results indicate that P. metricus queens
   exhibit personalities for all measured traits and correlations between
   different behavioral measures. Given that paper wasps have served as a
   model organism for a wide range of phenomena such as kin selection,
   dominance hierarchies, mate choice, facial recognition, social
   parasitism, and chemical recognition, we hope that our results will
   motivate researchers to explore whether, or to what degree, queen
   personality is important in their research programs.}},

Title = {{How does male-male competition generate negative frequency-dependent
   selection and disruptive selection during speciation?}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Natural selection has been shown to drive population differentiation and
   speciation. The role of sexual selection in this process is
   controversial; however, most of the work has centered on mate choice
   while the role of male-male competition in speciation is relatively
   understudied. Here, we outline how male-male competition can be a source
   of diversifying selection on male competitive phenotypes, and how this
   can contribute to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We highlight
   how negative frequency-dependent selection (advantage of rare phenotype
   arising from stronger male-male competition between similar male
   phenotypes compared with dissimilar male phenotypes) and disruptive
   selection (advantage of extreme phenotypes) drives the evolution of
   diversity in competitive traits such as weapon size, nuptial coloration,
   or aggressiveness. We underscore that male-male competition interacts
   with other life-history functions and that variable male competitive
   phenotypes may represent alternative adaptive options. In addition to
   competition for mates, aggressive interference competition for
   ecological resources can exert selection on competitor signals. We call
   for a better integration of male-male competition with ecological
   interference competition since both can influence the process of
   speciation via comparable but distinct mechanisms. Altogether, we
   present a more comprehensive framework for studying the role of
   male-male competition in speciation, and emphasize the need for better
   integration of insights gained from other fields studying the
   evolutionary, behavioral, and physiological consequences of agonistic
   interactions.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1870}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Variation in predation risk is a major driver of ecological and
   evolutionary change, and, in turn, of geographical variation in
   behaviour. While predation risk is rarely constant in natural
   populations, the extent to which variation in predation risk shapes
   individual behaviour in wild populations remains unclear. Here, we
   investigated individual differences in reproductive behaviour in 16
   Trinidadian guppy populations and related it to the observed variation
   in predator biomass each population experienced. Our results show that
   high heterogeneity in predator biomass is linked to individual
   behavioural diversification. Increased within-population heterogeneity
   in predator biomass is also associated with behavioural polymorphism.
   Some individuals adjust the frequency of consensual mating behaviour in
   response to differences in sex ratio context, while others display
   constantly at elevated frequencies. This pattern is analogous to a `live
   fast, die young' pace-of-life syndrome. Notably, both high and low mean
   differences in predator biomass led to a homogenization of individual
   frequency of consensual mating displays. Overall, our results
   demonstrate that individual behavioural variation is associated with
   heterogeneity in predator biomass, but not necessarily with changes in
   mean values of predator biomass. We suggest that heterogeneity in
   predator biomass is an informative predictor of adaptive responses to
   changes in biotic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Social network models provide a powerful tool to estimate infection risk
   for individual hosts and track parasite transmission through host
   populations. Here, bringing together concepts from social network
   theory, animal personality, and parasite manipulation of host behaviour,
   I argue that not only are social networks shaping parasite transmission,
   but parasites in turn shape social networks through their effects on the
   behaviour of infected individuals. Firstly, I review five general
   categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity
   levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied
   to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all
   of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering
   parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts
   within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g.,
   connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches
   allowing comparisons of social networks pre-versus post-infection are a
   promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks
   and parasite infections.}},

Abstract = {{Research on brood parasitism has focused primarily on specific host
   anti-parasite behaviours and parasite counter-adaptations, and little is
   known about other aspects of their behaviours such as consistent
   behavioural differences between individuals. Therefore, we examined
   consistency in behaviour of nestlings of common cuckoos (Cuculus
   canorus) raised by great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus).
   Cuckoo chicks showed high repeatability of both aggressive behaviour and
   breath rate, and both traits were strongly correlated with each other.
   This represents the first evidence for consistent differences in
   behaviour among avian brood parasites. Males were consistently more
   aggressive and less stressed than females. Nestlings of both sexes that
   hatched later in the season exhibited higher levels of aggression and
   lower stress responses than nestlings hatched earlier. This suggests
   that rearing conditions (e.g., food availability and quality) may
   modulate stress and aggressive phenotypes of brood parasites. We discuss
   potential effects of the observed patterns on host-parasite dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of animal contests have focused on the probability of winning an
   encounter, because it directly affects the benefits of competition.
   However, the costs (e.g., physiological stress) and benefits of
   competition should also depend on the number of aggressive encounters
   per unit time (combat rate, hereafter) in which the focal individual is
   involved. Using colourful and drab male house finches (Haemorhous
   mexicanus) from urban and rural sites, we showed that combat rate was
   repeatable across the same and different group sizes for birds who won
   competitions. In addition, colourful urban males exhibited the lowest
   propensity for frequent aggression (and hence low combat rate). However,
   male bill size (another trait we previously found to correlate with male
   competitiveness in this species) was not related to aggressive
   propensity. Combat rate can be predicted by male identity and some, but
   not all, predictors of male competitiveness.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the variation in dispersal, exploration, and aggression
   across time in juvenile progeny produced from wild caught rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at a critical developmental shift associated with
   the highest mortality in fish. By testing multiple ecologically relevant
   behaviours repeatedly in the same individuals, we simultaneously tested
   multiple hypotheses regarding personality, plasticity, and behavioural
   syndromes to better understand the innate behavioural variation in a
   population containing both migratory and resident life histories. There
   were consistent behavioural differences, or personality, between
   individuals across time, for dispersal, aggression, and exploration,
   unrelated to size or sex. The significant repeatabilities (0.10-0.46)
   indicate that these traits are potentially heritable. Also, we found
   both habituation in all behaviours and significant differences between
   individuals in the rate of that habituation, despite no evidence of a
   behavioural syndrome. The identification of this individual level
   variation is a step towards understanding which heritable traits
   selection could influence.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual behavioural differences ('animal personalities')
   are documented across a variety of animal taxa. Sexual selection,

   respect to personality traits in unconstrained choice tests. We here
   tested whether female mating preferences were non-random with respect to
   male and female neophobia in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), an
   important avian model of mate choice and animal personality research.
   Male and female neophobia was assessed by attaching novel objects to
   birds' feeders. Females' mating preferences were tested with randomly
   assigned, unfamiliar males in a four-way choice apparatus. Females
   associated most with males with neophobia scores similar to their own.
   These results provide evidence that mating preferences and personality
   traits can covary, supporting evolutionary scenarios of assortative
   mating contributing to the maintenance of personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-trait, multi-test approach to investigate the convergence or
   discrimination between behavioural tests putatively targeting the same
   or different animal personality traits has been recommended, yet whether

   investigation. Here, we used behavioural measures collected from five
   commonly used behavioural tests targeting three personality traits,
   evaluated their convergence/discrimination through exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA), and then explored whether the identification of syndrome
   changed based on the approach we used to quantify personality traits.
   Our results indicated that tests presumably targeting the same
   personality trait actually measured distinct behavioural aspects.
   Syndrome defined using correlation changed due to how we identified
   personality traits, but not when using structural equation models
   (SEMs). Overall, this study emphasizes that it is critical to clarify
   the approach and terms we use for `personality traits' in the field of
   animal personality.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite substantial research interest in understanding individual-level
   consistency in behavioral attributes, significant knowledge gaps remain
   across traits and taxa. For example, relatively few studies have looked
   at social personality in large marine species such as elasmobranchs and
   whether or not individual differences in behavior are maintained in
   unstable social groups (i.e., fission-fusion dynamics). However, it is
   important to investigate this topic in other model species than the
   usually small species with short generation times typically investigated
   in these areas of behavioral ecology. Indeed, studies on ecologically
   diverse taxa could provide mechanistic insights into the emergence and
   maintenance of animal personality and dynamics of social groups in
   animals. In addition, understanding social behavior at the group-and
   individual-level could improve conservation management of these large
   animals with long generation times (e.g., removal of particular
   behavioral types by fisheries practices). Here, we investigated
   consistent individual differences in sociability in wild juvenile lemon
   sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) over both short- (4 to 18 days) and
   long-term (4 months) sampling periods. Individual sharks were observed
   in social groups and scored according to the number of social
   interactions performed during observations. Despite variable individual
   group compositions between repeated trials, sharks showed consistent
   individual differences in their social behavior over both time scales.
   These results suggest reduced plasticity and highlight individuality as
   an important explanatory variable for the social dynamics of juvenile
   lemon sharks. In addition, long-term stability observed in this wild
   population demonstrates the importance of personality in the daily
   behavioral repertoire of juvenile lemon sharks. Our results are
   discussed in the context of other shark studies and taxonomic groups and
   potential avenues for future research are proposed.
   Significance statement
   This study investigated the social personality axis in a wild population
   of juvenile lemon sharks. First, we demonstrated consistent individual
   differences in their tendency to socialize. Second, we showed that
   individuals maintained their differences over a four-month period in the
   wild. Finally, we found that individual social behaviors were maintained
   despite being tested in variable group compositions. These results
   highlight the importance of individuality in the social dynamic of a
   poorly investigated animal and suggest personality as an important
   aspect of juvenile lemon sharks' everyday life over a relatively
   long-term period.}},

Title = {{Consistently bolder turtles maintain higher body temperatures in the

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral ecologists have assumed that animals will optimize behavior
   to match their current situation, yet studies reveal limited behavioral
   flexibility and extensive variation among individuals in their response
   to a similar stimulus. This phenomenon is referred to as ``animal
   personality,{''} and recent efforts seek to determine the implications
   of personality for interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment.
   Doing so promises to illuminate how selection is operating on behavioral
   traits and, consequently, how stable, among-individual variation in
   behavioral types is maintained evolutionarily. We examined a natural
   population of forest-dwelling eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina)
   to understand the effects of differences in levels of boldness on
   thermoregulatory behavior, injury history, and movement rates. Repeated
   behavioral trials revealed that individual turtles varied consistently
   and dramatically in boldness (latency to emerge from the shell or begin
   moving after handling and confinement). Behavioral differences were
   independent of phenotypic state or environmental conditions, suggesting
   the existence of personality in these turtles. Moreover, bolder turtles
   maintained higher body temperatures in the field and tended to have more
   damage to their shells, possibly indicative of more frequent predation
   attempts. Little work has been done on personality in terrestrial
   ectotherms, and this study enhances our understanding of this phenomenon
   by highlighting the potential trade-off between mortality and
   thermoregulation.
   Significance statement
   Animals often exhibit markedly different personality traits from each
   other. We sought to understand how personality traits affect
   interactions with the environment, and thus how natural selection may be
   acting upon and maintaining behavioral variation. We studied this in
   terrestrial ectotherms, box turtles, for whom the trade-off between
   basking and predation risk may be a significant factor. We found that
   individual turtles differed consistently in boldness (time spent hiding
   and immobile after handling) and that bolder turtles maintained higher
   body temperatures but tended to have more injuries on their shells. This
   suggests that being bold is beneficial for thermoregulation, which may
   enhance growth and fecundity, but could expose turtles to greater risk
   of predation. Variation in the expression of boldness may, therefore,
   serve to maintain behavioral variation in the population.}},

Title = {{Boldness-aggression syndromes can reduce population density: behavior
   and demographic heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-41}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are widely recognized as important for ecology and
   evolution, but most predictions about ecological impacts are based on
   conceptual models and are therefore imprecise. Borrowing insights from
   the theory of demographic heterogeneity, we derived insights about the
   population-dynamic effects of behavioral syndromes. If some individuals
   are consistently more aggressive than others, not just in interspecific
   contests, but also in foraging, mating, and antipredator behavior, then
   population dynamics could be affected by the resulting heterogeneity in
   demographic rates. We modeled a population with a
   boldness-aggressiveness syndrome (with the individual's trait constant
   through life), showing that the mortality cost of boldness causes
   aggressive individuals to die earlier, on average, than their
   nonaggressive siblings. The equilibrium frequency of the aggressive type
   is strongly affected by the mortality cost of boldness, but not directly
   by the reproductive benefit of aggressiveness. Introducing aggressive
   types into a homogeneous nonaggressive population increases the average
   per-capita mortality rate at equilibrium; under many conditions, this
   reduces the equilibrium density. One such condition is that the
   reproductive benefit of aggression is frequency dependent and the
   population has evolved to equalize the expected fitness of the two
   types. Finally, if the intensity of aggressiveness can evolve, then the
   population is likely to evolve to an evolutionarily stable trait value
   under biologically reasonable assumptions. This analysis shows how a
   formal model can predict both how a syndrome affects population dynamics
   and how the population processes constrain evolution of the trait.}},

Abstract = {{Using social information can benefit individuals in many ways.
   Responding to alarm signals can, for instance, maximize survival under
   predation risk. However, foraging individuals should consider the
   reliability of such risk-based information to balance antipredator
   behavior and resource acquisition. Receiver decisions could depend on
   personality effects, as individual variation in risk-taking tendencies
   (i.e., boldness) could not only affect receiver perception of the
   signaled threat but also signaler reliability. Recent theoretical models
   support the possibility of coevolution between personality and
   communication strategies. Using a playback experiment, we show that wild
   eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) respond to alarm calls according to
   their own boldness level (measured as consistent individual differences
   in basal vigilance) and that they increase their vigilance response to
   bolder callers potentially considered as more reliable. Further,
   receivers respond to the callers' boldness regardless of their own
   boldness and independently of their familiarity level with callers,
   therefore decoding this information from vocalizations. Such effects of
   individual behavioral variation on the perception and interpretation of
   social information could apply to signals used in a variety of
   ecological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence for consistent among-individual variation in
   individual sociability (e.g., tendency to be sociable) in a number of
   species. However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well
   as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate
   into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not
   yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons
   (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual
   variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of
   sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree,
   centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of
   preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences
   in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether
   observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social
   environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in
   social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in
   3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of
   time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found
   that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics
   of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of
   sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers
   of social behavior.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Environmental and developmental conditions can drive substantial
   variation in offspring behaviour and developmental trajectory. While
   incubation temperature is well known to influence development in
   oviparous animals, little is known of the role of parental temperature
   on offspring phenotype (i.e. thermal parental effects). Following
   exposure of male and gravid female jacky dragons, Amphibolurus
   muricatus, to one of two thermal treatments (short-bask versus
   long-bask) and incubation of their eggs at a constant temperature, we
   examined whether the preovipositional parental treatment influenced
   offspring performance-related behaviours. We detected main and
   interactive effects of parental treatment on offspring behaviours
   including feeding, exploration and antipredator. Sex-specific effects of
   parental treatment included long-bask sons being more likely to feed and
   being bolder following predatory attack than short-bask sons, while the
   differences between treatments for daughters were smaller. Behaviours
   were not consistent between 1 week and 1 month of age and showed little
   correlation across behavioural contexts. Some behaviours emerged as
   promising mechanisms of documented parental effects on offspring growth
   and survival in these individuals. In particular, boldness among
   long-bask sons in an antipredator context may be linked to their greater
   rates of growth posthatching. Overall, our findings suggest that thermal
   parental effects influence variation in animal behaviours relevant for
   subsequent fitness outcomes. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Social conformity in solitary crabs, Carcinus maenas, is driven by
   individual differences in behavioural plasticity}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{131-137}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Group living is widespread in the animal kingdom and recent studies into
   the mechanisms underlying group cohesion and behavioural synchrony have
   highlighted the importance of between-individual behavioural differences
   ('animal personality'). In group-living animals, social conformity
   occurs when animals compromise their own behaviour to the level of a
   certain behaviour displayed by another individual or a group, and the
   degree to which individuals conform can depend upon interindividual
   differences in behavioural types. Social conformity can increase group
   cohesion and ultimately predator avoidance and/or resource acquisition
   for group-living individuals. However, it remains unclear whether
   similar conformity effects exist in solitary species, many of which form
   temporary aggregations and, if so, whether changes in behaviour in the
   presence of conspecifics are dependent on individuals' personalities in
   solitary contexts. We studied the effects of social context (i.e. the
   presence of a conspecific) on behaviour in solitary shore crabs, using
   automated video tracking. Individuals differed consistently in their
   activity levels within and across contexts and were significantly more
   active in solitary than dyadic contexts. No differences in activity
   between same- and opposite-sex dyads were found. Crabs' activity levels
   were more similar when tested together than when tested alone,
   indicating a social conformity effect. Furthermore, more active
   behavioural types decreased their activity to a greater extent when
   paired with a conspecific. The sex composition of the dyad had no effect
   on changes in activity. Overall, our findings suggest that social
   conformity is moderated by individual behavioural differences in a
   solitary organism. It is often presumed that, over evolutionary time,
   the social structure of animal populations has important consequences
   for the evolution of personalities and vice versa. We suggest that
   studying solitary or facultatively social organisms may allow
   researchers to tease out causality between personality differences and
   socioecological dynamics. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Habitat complexity dampens selection on prey activity level}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Conspecific prey individuals often exhibit persistent differences in
   behavior (i.e., animal personality) and consequently vary in their
   susceptibility to predation. How this form of selection varies across
   environmental contexts is essential to predicting ecological and
   evolutionary dynamics, yet remains currently unresolved. Here, we use
   three separate predator-prey systems (sea star-snail, wolf
   spider-cricket, and jumping spider-cricket) to independently examine how
   habitat structural complexity influences the selection that predators
   impose on prey behavioral types. Prior to conducting staged
   predator-prey interaction encounters, we ran prey individuals through
   multiple behavioral assays to determine their average activity level. We
   then allowed individual predators to interact with groups of prey in
   either open or structurally complex habitats and recorded the number and
   individual identity of prey that were eaten. Habitat complexity had no
   effect on overall predation rates in any of the three predator-prey
   systems. Despite this, we detected a pervasive interaction between
   habitat structure and individual prey activity level in determining
   individual prey survival. In open habitats, all predators imposed strong
   selection on prey behavioral types: sea stars preferentially consumed
   sedentary snails, while spiders preferentially consumed active crickets.
   Habitat complexity dampened selection within all three systems,
   equalizing the predation risk that active and sedentary prey faced.
   These findings suggest a general effect of habitat complexity that
   reduces the importance of prey activity level in determining individual
   predation risk. We reason this occurs because activity level (i.e.,
   movement) is paramount in determining risk within open environments,
   whereas in complex habitats, other behavioral traits (e.g., escape
   ability to a refuge) may take precedence.}},

Pages = {{74-83}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive
   success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental
   conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain
   unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed
   rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand
   among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have
   highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding
   success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual
   behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per
   behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding
   seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay,
   South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in
   penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian
   approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the
   trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in
   African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold,
   mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their
   breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015
   and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to
   nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly
   influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most
   successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially
   apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher
   energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents
   grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend
   their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression
   when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food
   availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context
   of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent,
   risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be
   reduced in African penguins.}},

   individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated
   that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially
   stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect
   traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome,
   respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using
   a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response
   syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important
   ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter
   decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling
   population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is
   likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of
   phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels
   of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and
   evolutionary ecology.}},

Title = {{Pesticide-induced changes in personality depend on the urbanization
   level}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Globally increasing urbanization causes major anthropogenic changes in
   ecosystems, drastically altering phenotypes of organisms. Increased
   contamination is a well-known result of urbanization, and its effect on
   behaviour has been extensively studied. Yet, animal personality,
   consistent behavioural variation between individuals, has rarely been
   investigated in the context of anthropogenic contaminants. Changes in
   personalities may affect the viability of populations, and even alter
   community dynamics. We investigated the effects of exposure to a
   sublethal dose of the commonly used pesticide esfenvalerate on two
   personality traits, activity and boldness, and compared these effects
   between replicated rural and urban populations using larvae of the
   damselfly Coenagrion puella. We tested for effects on behaviour at three
   distinct levels: the average levels of behaviours, the consistency of
   behaviours (repeatability), and the structure of the behavioural
   correlations (behavioural syndrome). We found that the pesticide
   treatment changed the average activity and the behavioural covariation
   (activity and boldness), but not the behavioural repeatability.
   Importantly, these pesticide-induced patterns depended strongly on
   urbanization level. The average activity reduction due to pesticide
   exposure was only present in urban individuals. Moreover, while a
   behavioural correlation between activity and boldness in rural larvae
   appeared only after the pesticide treatment, this activity-boldness
   syndrome was consistently present in the urban larvae. These
   differential responses of urban and rural populations may be explained
   by the apparently more efficient coping mechanism with contaminants of
   urban populations, as well as the generally more stressful urban
   habitats. These results highlight the importance of measuring
   behavioural expressions at various levels when assessing contaminant
   effects, and not just the means. Further, we suggest that pollution may
   play an important role in understanding the evolution and maintenance of
   animal personalities in natural populations. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{Considering that each personality type in animals presents distinct
   physiological and behavioural responses, this study evaluated the
   efficiency of the Novel Environment test to classify larvae of
   Lophiosilurus alexandri into bold and shy individuals, which were then
   investigated for growth, cannibalism and mortality in larviculture of
   pure and mixed groups. Larvae with an average weight of 24.0 +/- 1.7 mg
   and length of 14.1 +/- 0.4 mm, were subjected to a Novel Environment
   test to classify their personality type (bold and shy larvae). After the
   larvae were classified according to personality type, they were
   subjected to larviculture for 15 days. Three treatments were tested:
   only bold larvae, only shy larvae, and a mixed treatment (bold larvae +
   shy larvae) at a density for 16 larvae/L, which were fed 3 times a day
   with Anemia nauplii. After larviculture, there were no differences in
   the final lengths of larvae of the bold, shy, and mixed treatments (26.9
   +/- 0.76 mm, 26.7 +/- 1.00 mm, and 26.8 +/- 1.24 mm, respectively);
   however, shy larvae possessed weighed less (0.22 +/- 0.01 g) than the
   bold and mixed treatments, which did not differ significantly (0.25 +/-
   0.02 g and 0.27 +/- 0.02 g, respectively). The bold and mixed treatments
   had the highest cannibalism rate (11.2 +/- 5.1\% and 23.1 +/- 12.3\%,
   respectively). Overall survival was lowest in the mixed treatment (62.5
   +/- 13.0\%), while that of the bold and shy treatments were similar
   (82.5 +/- 9.2\% and 86.2 +/- 9.2\%, respectively). The separation of L.
   alexandri larvae by traits can ensure a decrease in cannibalism and
   hence, more productive larviculture.}},

Title = {{Smaller and bolder prey snails have higher survival in staged encounters

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{633-638}},

Abstract = {{Temporally consistent individual differences in behavior, also known as
   animal personality, can have large impacts on individual fitness. Here,
   we explore the degree to which individual differences in anti-predator
   response (or boldness) influence survival rates in groups of snails
   Chlorostoma funebralis when they encounter a predatory sea star Pisaster
   giganteus. The snail C. funebralis shows consistent individual variation
   in predator response where some fearful snails actively flee bodies of
   water occupied by predators whereas bolder snails consistently do not.
   We show here that bold snails are significantly more likely to survive
   encounters with a predatory sea star and, somewhat counterintuitively,
   fearful snails actually suffer higher mortality rates. We also found
   that smaller snails and those occurring at higher experimental densities
   experienced higher per capita survival rates. Positive effects of prey
   boldness on survival are not uncommonly reported in the animal
   personality literature; however, such results are inconsistent with
   classic animal personality theory borrowed from the optimal foraging
   literature. The findings herein add to the growing body of evidence that
   consistent individual differences in behavior can impact predator-prey
   interactions and that boldness is potentially under positive
   predator-driven selection in some systems.}},

Title = {{Environment-dependence of behavioural consistency in adult male European
   green lizards (Lacerta viridis)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the background mechanisms affecting the emergence and
   maintenance of consistent between-individual variation within population
   in single (animal personality) or across multiple (behavioural syndrome)
   behaviours has key importance. State-dependence theory suggests that
   behaviour is `anchored' to individual state (e.g. body condition,
   gender, age) and behavioural consistency emerges through
   behavioural-state feedbacks. A number of relevant state variables are
   labile (e.g. body condition, physiological performance) and expected to
   be affected by short-term environmental change. Yet, whether short-term
   environmental shifts affect behavioural consistency during adulthood
   remains questionable. Here, by employing a full-factorial laboratory
   experiment, we explored if quantity of food (low vs. high) and time
   available for thermoregulation (3h vs. 10h per day) had an effect on
   activity and risk-taking of reproductive adult male European green
   lizards (Lacerta viridis). We focussed on different components of
   behavioural variation: (i) strength of behavioural consistency
   (repeatability for animal personality; between-individual correlation
   for behavioural syndrome), (ii) behavioural type (individual mean
   behaviour) and (iii) behavioural predictability (within-individual
   behavioural variation). Activity was repeatable in all treatments.
   Risktaking was repeatable only in the low basking treatments. We found
   significant between-individual correlation only in the low food x long
   basking time group. The treatments did not affect behavioural type, but
   affected behavioural predictability. Activity predictability was higher
   in the short basking treatment, where it also decreased with size
   (approximate to age). Risk-taking predictability in the short basking
   treatment increased with size under food limitation, but decreased when
   food supply was high. We conclude that short-term environmental change
   can alter various components of behavioural consistency. The effect
   could be detected in the presence/absence patterns of animal personality
   and behavioural syndrome and the level of individual behavioural
   predictability, but not in behavioural type.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing recognition of the role of individual variation in
   patterns emerging at higher levels of biological organization. Despite
   the importance of the temporal configuration of ecological processes and
   patterns, intraspecific individual variation in diel activity patterns
   is almost never accounted for in behavioral studies at the population
   level. We used individual-based monitoring data from 98 GPS-collared
   brown bears in Scandinavia to estimate diel activity patterns before the
   fall hunting season. We extracted 7 activity measures related to timing
   and regularity of activity from individual activity profiles. We then
   used multivariate analysis to test for the existence of distinct
   activity tactics and their environmental determinants, followed by
   generalized linear regression to estimate the extent of
   within-individual repeatability of activity tactics. We detected 4
   distinct activity tactics, with a high degree of individual fidelity to
   a given tactic. Demographic factors, availability of key foraging
   habitat, and human disturbance were important determinants of activity
   tactics. Younger individuals and those with higher bear and road
   densities within their home range were more nocturnal and more likely to
   rest during the day. Good foraging habitat and increasing age led to
   more diurnal activity patterns and nocturnal resting periods. We did not
   find evidence of diel activity tactics influencing survival during the
   subsequent hunting season. We conclude that individual variation in
   activity deserves greater attention than it currently receives, as it
   may help account for individual heterogeneity in fitness and could
   facilitate within-population niche partitioning that can have
   population-or community-level consequences.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{29-34}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary
   process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and
   colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome
   suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural
   tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the
   composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately,
   colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition
   dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an
   individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as
   competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was
   linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression
   in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a
   successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to
   our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity,
   exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency
   was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals
   dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The
   presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1)
   dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2)
   aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding,
   thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of
   their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the
   ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and
   suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an
   important role in dispersal decisions. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Habitat-specific selection pressures have been widely recognized, but
   whether selection favours different personality types in different
   habitats has rarely been evaluated. This study aimed to test whether
   personality-related differences in annual reproductive success differed
   between two populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) occupying
   different Mediterranean habitats (oakwood and pinewood). We measured
   exploration and parental provisioning behaviours and used a path
   analysis to ask how the interplay between these two behavioural traits
   affected reproductive success in each of these two habitats. We found
   that blue tits breeding in the pinewood were slow-exploring compared to
   blue tits breeding in the oakwood, suggesting the occurrence of
   personality-related differences in settlement, or behavioural plasticity
   in response to habitat. Exploration behaviour and feeding rates were
   positively associated, suggesting that they affect each other or that
   there is an environmental factor affecting both traits simultaneously.
   Finally, fast explorers were favoured in the pinewood, while there was
   no selection acting on exploration behaviour in the oak habitat. These
   findings emphasize the importance of integrating habitat selection,
   plasticity and personality in the study of behavioural evolution.}},

Title = {{Performance of wild brown trout in relation to energetic state and

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life stage is typically a selective bottleneck during which
   individual performance is important for survival. We investigated size,
   energetic state, and activity, in relation to recapture probability in
   the youngest free-swimming stage of a territorial fish, the brown trout.
   In two experiments, we induced compensatory growth in wild-caught brown
   trout fry, using a restriction-refeeding protocol. Upon refeeding in the
   laboratory, the restricted trout showed compensatory growth in mass, but
   not in length. During this compensatory growth phase, we released the
   fish into their native stream habitat and then recaptured them after 1
   month to assess survival and growth. Despite not having fully
   compensated body size at release, restricted fish did not show continued
   growth compensation in the stream, indicating that the natural
   environment limits growth capacity during early life. Individual
   baseline activity was scored in open-field tests before and after food
   restriction and was found repeatable but not significantly affected by
   growth manipulations. Under natural conditions, we found a positive
   association between open-field activity and survival (as indicated by
   recapture probability), but no significant differences between
   food-restricted and control fish. Initial body length positively
   influenced survival in the first experiment (early summer), but not in
   the second (late summer). These results contrast with the assumption
   that high baseline activity should be riskier in natural environments.
   For territorial animals, we hypothesize that activity is associated with
   high aggression and territoriality, which facilitates access to
   high-quality territories providing both shelter from predation and
   reduced starvation risk, which reduces mortality risk.
   Significance statement
   In the early critical life stage, more active brown trout are better
   survivors. This finding, which contradicts general assumptions about the
   balance between predator exposure and food intake, could possibly be due
   to trout being highly territorial species in which active individuals
   can claim the best territories. We also find that young trout are likely
   limited in growth rate by environmental conditions in the wild, as
   growth compensation following food restriction is possible in the lab,
   but not realized in natural streams.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging hypothesis of animal personality posits that animals choose
   the habitat that best fits their personality, and that the match between
   habitat and personality can facilitate population differentiation, and
   eventually speciation. However, behavioural plasticity and the
   adjustment of behaviours to new environments have been a classical
   explanation for such matching patterns. Using a population of dunnocks
   (Prunella modularis), we empirically tested whether personality or
   behavioural plasticity is responsible for the non-random distribution of
   shy and bold individuals in a heterogeneous environment. We found
   evidence for bold individuals settling in areas with high human
   disturbance, but also that birds became bolder with increasing age.
   Importantly, personality primarily determines the distribution of
   individuals, and behavioural adjustment over time contributes very
   little to the observed patterns. We cannot, however, exclude a
   possibility of very early behavioural plasticity (a type of
   developmental plasticity) shaping what we refer to as `personality'.
   Nonetheless, our findings highlight the role personality plays in
   shaping population structure, lending support to the theory of
   personality-mediated speciation. Moreover, personality-matching habitat
   choice has important implications for population management and
   conservation.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts associations
   between life history and `risky' behaviours. Individuals with `fast'
   lifestyles should develop faster, reproduce earlier, exhibit more
   risk-prone behaviours, and die sooner than those with `slow' lifestyles.
   While support for POLS has been equivocal to date, studies have relied
   on individual-level (phenotypic) patterns in which genetic trade-offs
   may be masked by environmental effects on phenotypes. We estimated
   genetic correlations between life history (development, lifespan, size)
   and risky behaviours (exploration, aggression) in a pedigreed population
   of Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Path analyses
   showed that behaviours mediated some genetic relationships between life
   history traits, though not those involved in trade-offs. Thus, while
   specific predictions of POLS theory were not supported, genetic
   integration of behaviour and life history was present. This implies a
   major role for risky behaviours in life history evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animals differ consistently in their behaviour, thus
   impacting a wide variety of ecological outcomes. Recent advances in
   animal personality research have established the ecological importance
   of the multidimensional behavioural volume occupied by individuals and
   by multispecies communities. Here, we examine the degree to which the
   multidimensional behavioural volume of a group predicts the outcome of
   both intra-and interspecific interactions. In particular, we test the
   hypothesis that a population of conspecifics will experience low
   intraspecific competition when the population occupies a large volume in
   behavioural space. We further hypothesize that populations of
   interacting species will exhibit greater interspecific competition when
   one or both species occupy large volumes in behavioural space. We
   evaluate these hypotheses by studying groups of katydids (Scudderia
   nymphs) and froghoppers (Philaenus spumarius), which compete for food
   and space on their shared host plant, Solidago canadensis. We found that
   individuals in single-species groups of katydids positioned themselves
   closer to one another, suggesting reduced competition, when groups
   occupied a large behavioural volume. When both species were placed
   together, we found that the survival of froghoppers was greatest when
   both froghoppers and katydids occupied a small volume in behavioural
   space, particularly at high froghopper densities. These results suggest
   that groups that occupy large behavioural volumes can have low
   intraspecific competition but high interspecific competition. Thus,
   behavioural hypervolumes appear to have ecological consequences at both
   the level of the population and the community and may help to predict
   the intensity of competition both within and across species. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes (i.e. population-level behavioural correlations)
   arise when individuals, on average, maintain the same behavioural
   expression across different ecological contexts. Population-level
   syndromes can appear maladaptive, such as when prey remain active across
   the absence and presence of a sit-and-wait predator. Yet in nature,
   individuals often vary in syndrome adherence, exhibiting
   individual-level differences in behavioural plasticity. Here, I use an
   experiment to show that individual behavioural plasticity (a reduction
   in activity level in the presence of predation threat) increases a
   prey's likelihood of surviving predator exposure, and further predicts
   survival better than single-context activity level measures. In an
   additional experiment, I identify conditioning (nonlethal predator
   exposure) as a process that reduces prey activity level. This work
   demonstrates that although population-level behavioural syndromes can
   appear maladaptive, behavioural plasticity and conditioning could
   potentially ameliorate negative effects at the individual level. (C)

Abstract = {{Motivation to explore is believed to be widespread among animals, but
   exploratory behaviour varies within populations. Offering variety in
   feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to
   express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals' exploration of
   different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a
   balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested
   the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed
   vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying
   types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also
   investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by
   measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in
   preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was
   evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and
   novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the
   constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at
   varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0
   to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour
   trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake
   of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied
   flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel
   object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and
   exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits.
   These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule
   as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of
   enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd.}},

   song: sensitivity of signals to varying environments}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To provide reliable information about individual-specific
   characteristics, sexual signals should be consistently displayed within
   an individual at least within a particular social context or time
   window. However, some male traits, like bird song, depict extreme
   within-individual variations even within a very short time frame. To
   investigate the extent by which acoustic displays in male collared
   flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) reveal consistent individual-specific
   attributes or more flexible characteristics, we assessed the
   repeatability of various song traits at different sampling regimes
   (within-day, between-day, and between-year contexts). Repertoire size
   showed considerably high and significant repeatability (R > 0.25) in all
   temporal contexts suggesting that it can potentially indicate an
   individual attribute that is shaped by genetic background, permanent
   environmental effects, or long-term experience. Song rate, song length,
   mean frequency and frequency bandwidth, tempo of syllables, and
   within-song complexity had small-to-moderate repeatability (R < 0.25)
   that was significant for the within-day scenario only. Environmental
   effects can confound repeatability estimates, as males that changed nest
   boxes between song recordings performed with lower consistency than
   those that systematically sang on the same territory. Hence, the
   characteristics of particular songs could reveal aspects that are
   sensitive to changes in the environment rendering a signal function to
   the within-individual variance of songs. The consistency of acoustic
   signals and their sensitivity to the environment determines what kind of
   information can be conveyed to the receivers.
   Significance statement
   We investigated the repeatability of several song traits in the collared
   flycatcher to determine signal consistency in different temporal
   contexts: within days, between days, and between years. We found that
   repeatability greatly varied across traits, but it generally showed a
   decreasing tendency as sampling window increased. Repeatability was
   confounded by effects arising from territory identity, because
   individuals that changed residency between days sang with less
   consistency. This result highlights the often-neglected scenario that
   pseudo-repeatability may arise due to unstandardized environment. In
   general, our findings imply that the consistency of behaviors and the
   signal value of song traits may depend on the considered temporal and/or
   environmental context. The degree of plasticity of acoustic signals
   determines whether information on a long-term aspect of individual
   quality or on an immediate state can be conveyed to the receivers.}},

Abstract = {{An intriguing question in behavioral biology is whether consistent
   individual differences (called animal personalities) relate to variation
   in cognitive performance because commonly measured personality traits
   may be associated with risk-reward trade-offs. Social insects, whose
   learning abilities have been extensively characterized, show consistent
   behavioral variability, both at colony and at individual level. We
   investigated the possible link between personality traits and learning
   performance in the carpenter ant Camponotus aethiops. Exploratory
   activity, sociability, and aggression were assessed twice in ant
   foragers. Behaviors differed among individuals, they were partly
   repeatable across time and exploratory activity correlated positively
   with aggression. Learning abilities were quantified by differential
   conditioning of the maxilla-labium extension response, a task that
   requires cue perception and information storage. We found that
   exploratory activity of individual ants significantly predicted learning
   performance: ``active-explorers{''} were slower in learning the task
   than ``inactive-explorers{''}. The results suggest for the first time a
   link between a personality trait and cognitive performance in eusocial
   insects, and that the underlying individual variability could affect
   colony performance and success.}},

Abstract = {{In animal societies, behavioral idiosyncrasies of the individuals often
   guide which tasks they should perform. Such personality-specific task
   participation can increase individual task efficiency, thereby improving
   group performance. While several recent studies have documented
   group-level benefits of within-group behavioral (i.e., personality)
   diversity, how these benefits are realized at the individual level is
   unclear. Here we probe the individual-level benefits of
   personality-driven task participation in the social spider Stegodyphus
   dumicola. In S. dumicola, the presence of at least one highly bold
   individual catalyzes foraging behavior in shy colony members, and all
   group constituents heavily compete for prey. We assessed boldness by
   examining how quickly spiders resumed normal movement after a simulated
   predator attack. We test here whether (1) participants in collective
   foraging gain more mass from prey items and (2) whether bold individuals
   are less resistant to starvation than shy spiders, which would motivate
   the bold individuals to forage more. Next, we assembled colonies of shy
   spiders with and without a bold individual, added one prey item, and
   then tracked the mass gain of each individual spider after this single
   feeding event. We found that spiders that participated in prey capture
   (whether bold or shy) gained more mass than nonparticipators, and
   colonies containing a single bold spider gained more total mass than
   purely shy colonies. We also found that bold spiders participated in
   more collective foraging events and were more susceptible to starvation
   than shy spiders, suggesting that the aggressive foraging of bold
   individuals may represent a strategy to offset starvation risk. These
   findings add to the body of evidence that animal personality can shape
   social organization, individual performance, and group success.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to respond flexibly to environmental challenges, for
   instance by learning or by responding appropriately to novel stimuli,
   may be crucial for survival and reproductive success. Experiences made
   during early ontogeny can shape the degree of behavioural flexibility
   maintained by individuals during later life. In natural habitats,
   animals are exposed to a multitude of social and non-social ecological
   factors during early ontogeny, but their relative influences on future
   learning ability and behavioural flexibility are only poorly understood.
   In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we
   investigated whether early social and predator experiences shape the
   learning performance, flexibility, and response to novelty of adults.
   Fish were reared either with or without parents and helpers and with or
   without perceived predation risk in a full-factorial experiment. We
   investigated the influence of these treatments on learning performance
   and flexibility in a spatial acquisition and reversal learning task. To
   test for response to novelty, we performed a neophobia test. We found
   that fish reared with predator experience, but without the presence of
   older group members outperformed fish with other rearing backgrounds in
   reversal learning and that individuals, which had been reared in a
   socially more complex environment together with older group members
   responded less neophobic toward a novel object than individuals reared
   among siblings only. Comparative evidence from fish and rats suggests
   that these developmental effects may be driven by the cues of safety
   perceived in the presence of guarding parents.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitism is a consequence of complex interactions between host,
   parasite, and their shared environment, and host behavior can influence
   parasite risk. Animal personality (i.e., consistent behavioral
   differences that are repeatable across time and context) can influence
   parasitism with more explorative individuals typically hosting greater
   parasite loads. Host sociality is known to impact parasite risk with
   more social individuals typically at higher risk of acquiring or
   transmitting parasites, but other behaviors could also be important. We
   quantified personality in least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), including
   repeatability of behavioral traits, and determined whether these
   personality traits affected ectoparasite prevalence and abundance. We
   measured personality using standardized hole-board tests and quantified
   ectoparasitism of 39 least chipmunks over 2years at a site in
   southeastern Manitoba, Canada. We found that activity and exploration
   were repeatable within the context of the hole-board test for least
   chipmunks, which suggests that these traits reflect personality. More
   exploratory individuals hosted a greater abundance of ectoparasites
   compared to less exploratory individuals. Our results are consistent
   with past studies implicating personality as a factor in host-parasite
   dynamics and suggest that exploration may be an important behavioral
   correlate of parasite acquisition.}},

Title = {{Chronic social defeat induces long-term behavioral depression of
   aggressive motivation in an invertebrate model system}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Losing a fight against a conspecific male (social defeat) induces a
   period of suppressed aggressiveness and general behaviour, often with
   symptoms common to human psychiatric disorders. Agonistic experience is
   also discussed as a potential cause of consistent, behavioral
   differences between individuals (animal ``personality{''}). In
   non-mammals, however, the impact of single agonistic encounters
   typically last only hours, but then again studies of repeated
   intermittent defeat (chronic social defeat) are seldom. We report the
   effect of chronic social defeat in adult male crickets (Gryllus
   bimaculatus), for which all known behavioral effects of defeat last only
   3 h. Firstly, after 48 h social isolation, crickets that experienced 5
   defeats at 24 h intervals against the same, weight-matched opponent
   exhibited suppressed aggressiveness lasting > 24 h, which was still
   evident when the animals were matched against an unfamiliar opponent at
   the last trial. Secondly, this longer-term depression of aggression also
   occurred in 48 h isolated crickets that lost 6 fights at 1 h intervals
   against unfamiliar opponents at each trial. Thirdly, crickets isolated
   as larvae until adult maturity (> 16 days) were significantly more
   aggressive, and less variable in their aggressiveness at their very
   first fight than 48 h isolates, and also significantly more resilient to
   the effects of chronic social defeat. We conclude that losing an
   aggressive encounter in crickets has a residual effect, lasting at least
   24 h, that accumulates when repeated defeats are experienced, and leads
   to a prolonged depression of aggressive motivation in subordinates.
   Furthermore, our data indicate that social interactions between young
   adults and possibly larvae can have even longer, possibly lifelong
   influences on subsequent behavior. Social subjugation is thus likely to
   be a prime determinant of inter-individual behavioral differences in
   crickets. Our work also opens new avenues for investigating proximate
   mechanisms underlying depression-like phenomena.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An animal's life history, physiology, and behaviour can be shaped by
   selection in a manner that favours strong associations among these
   aspects of an integrated phenotype. Recent work combining animal
   personality and life-history theory proposes that animals with faster
   life-history strategies (i.e., fast growth, high annual reproductive
   rate, short lifespan) should exhibit higher general activity levels
   relative to those with slower life history strategies, but empirical
   tests of within-species variation in these traits are lacking. In garter
   snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history
   strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick
   rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a
   measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly
   positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials.
   Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence
   of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of
   activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors,
   such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select
   for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to
   facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges. Thus, we offer
   evidence that behaviour is an important component of co-evolved suites
   of traits forming a general pace -of-life continuum in this system.}},

   melanogaster: The importance of controlling female behaviour}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{84-90}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Work on the repeatability of reproductive behaviour has mainly focused
   on the consistency of female preferences. We characterised the
   consistency of individual male Drosophila melanogaster reproductive
   behaviour in two experiments. In the first experiment, we allowed males
   to interact with a pair of live females that differed in body size. We
   then controlled female behaviour in a second experiment by examining the
   courtship behaviour of individual males interacting with a pair of
   decapitated females that varied in body size. In both experiments, we
   examined the consistency of individual male reproductive behaviour
   across two repeated trials on the same day. Males did not exhibit a
   courtship preference for the larger female in either experiment, but, in
   experiment 1, males did exhibit post-copulatory choice by copulating for
   longer durations with the large female, and males that mated with the
   same type of female in both trials exhibited repeatable behaviour. In
   general, we found weak evidence of consistent male courtship behaviour
   in the presence of behaving females. However, when female behaviour was
   controlled in experiment 2, we found that male courtship behaviour was
   highly repeatable. These results indicate that individual male D.
   melanogaster exhibit consistent reproductive behaviour and demonstrate
   the importance of controlling female behaviour when attempting to
   characterise the repeatability of male reproductive behaviour.}},

Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of animal
   personality. Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between
   behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for
   behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny.
   The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and
   behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However,
   the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare.
   Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and
   juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures
   than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound
   changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In
   this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral
   syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the
   desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate
   behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life
   stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature
   females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater
   aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their
   environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory
   cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations
   do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between
   aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature
   males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable
   across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that
   behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our
   results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait
   values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with
   developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation,
   albeit at different time points in males and females. This period of the
   life cycle merits systematic examination across taxa.}},

Title = {{Aggressiveness as a latent personality trait of domestic dogs: Testing
   local independence and measurement invariance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Studies of animal personality attempt to uncover underlying or
   ``latent{''} personality traits that explain broad patterns of
   behaviour, often by applying latent variable statistical models (e.g.,
   factor analysis) to multivariate data sets. Two integral, but
   infrequently confirmed, assumptions of latent variable models in animal
   personality are: i) behavioural variables are independent (i.e.,
   uncorrelated) conditional on the latent personality traits they reflect
   (local independence), and ii) personality traits are associated with
   behavioural variables in the same way across individuals or groups of
   individuals (measurement invariance). We tested these assumptions using
   observations of aggression in four age classes (4-10 months, 10 months-3
   years, 3-6 years, over 6 years) of male and female shelter dogs (N =
   4,743) in 11 different contexts. A structural equation model supported
   the hypothesis of two positively correlated personality traits
   underlying aggression across contexts: aggressiveness towards people and
   aggressiveness towards dogs (comparative fit index: 0.96; TuckerLewis
   index: 0.95; root mean square error of approximation: 0.03). Aggression
   across contexts was moderately repeatable (towards people: intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.479; towards dogs: ICC = 0.303).
   However, certain contexts related to aggressiveness towards people (but
   not dogs) shared significant residual relationships unaccounted for by
   latent levels of aggressiveness. Furthermore, aggressiveness towards
   people and dogs in different contexts interacted with sex and age. Thus,
   sex and age differences in displays of aggression were not simple
   functions of underlying aggressiveness. Our results illustrate that the
   robustness of traits in latent variable models must be critically
   assessed before making conclusions about the effects of, or factors
   influencing, animal personality. Our findings are of concern because
   inaccurate ``aggressive personality{''} trait attributions can be costly
   to dogs, recipients of aggression and society in general.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{The idea of animals possessing personalities was once dismissed by the
   scientific community, but has since gained traction with evidence for
   potential application to improve captive animal management and welfare.
   Although domestic cats are popular companion animals, research has
   tended to overlook the value of personality assessment for management
   and care of pet cats. The aim of this study was to investigate
   personality in a large sample of pet cats with a view to understanding
   practical implications for pet cats in the home. Personality of 2,802
   pet cats, from South Australia and New Zealand, was rated by their
   owners utilising a survey measuring 52 personality traits. Five reliable
   personality factors were found using principal axis factor analysis:
   Neuroticism, Extraversion, Dominance, Impulsiveness and Agreeableness.
   Implications for the `Feline Five' are discussed in relation to their
   potential application to improving the management and welfare of pet
   cats. Highly Impulsive cats for example, may be reacting to something
   stressful in their environment, whereas cats with low Agreeableness
   scores, showing irritability may indicate underlying pain or illness.
   Thus, the need for a systematic and holistic approach to personality
   that includes both the individual pet cat and its environment is
   recommended, and opens the door to future interdisciplinary
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Despite accumulating evidence for individual variation in behavioural
   plasticity, there is currently little understanding of the causes and
   consequences of this variation. An outstanding question is whether
   individual reaction norm (RN) slopes are consistent across different
   environmental variables-that is, whether an individual that is highly
   responsive to one environmental variable will be equally responsive to a
   second variable. Another important and related question is whether RNs
   are themselves consistently expressed through time or whether they are
   simply state dependent. Here, we quantified individual activity rates of
   zebrafish in response to independent manipulations of temperature and
   food availability that were repeated in discrete `bursts' of sampling
   through time. Individuals that were thermally responsive were not more
   responsive to food deprivation, but they did exhibit greater unexplained
   variation. Individual RN slopes were consistent (repeatable) over time
   for both temperature (R-slope = 0.92) and food deprivation responses
   (R-slope = 0.4), as were mean activity rates in the standard environment
   (R-intercept = 0.83). Despite the high potential lability of behaviour,
   we have demonstrated consistency of behavioural RN components and
   identified potential energetic constraints leading to high consistency
   of thermal RNs and low consistency of food deprivation RNs.}},

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing debate on how personality types are maintained
   within populations. We tested, for the first time, the potential of
   trait multidimensionality and trait compensation, where prey compensate
   for the costs of one trait by relying more on another one, in
   maintaining variation in boldness within a population. We studied how
   four boldness-related traits and swimming escape performance covary and
   shape the probability of survival and autotomy of Ischnura pumilio
   damselfly larvae in an experiment with predatory dragonfly larvae. Our
   results did not support the common belief that bold individuals are
   selected against in terms of survival selection by predation. Instead,
   we found survival selection favouring individuals combining being bold
   for two boldness-related traits. The four boldness-related traits did
   not covary frequently, supporting the multidimensionality of boldness.
   Moreover, animals bolder for one trait (activity in the presence of
   predator cues) were shyer for another trait (response to predator cues),
   which indicated trait compensation. However, the support for trait
   compensation was limited. The only other case of trait compensation was
   that bold larvae compensated for their increased risk-taking behaviour
   in the presence of a predator with a higher probability of autotomy.
   These patterns may contribute to maintaining variation in boldness in
   damselfly populations. Just as boldness-related traits are
   multidimensional, the mechanisms underlying their persistence in natural
   populations are also likely to be multifaceted. (C) 2017 The Association

   versus cognitive syndromes}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{119-131}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ consistently in their behaviour. Such
   individual differences may represent adaptations. Recently, researchers
   have started to implement the same adaptive framework to individual
   differences in cognition, leading to the suggestion that personality and
   cognition should covary. To determine the contextual consistency of
   cognitive traits and their covariation with several personality traits,
   24 guinea pigs, Cavia aperea f. porcellus, were tested using a battery
   of 12 cognitive tests. Four tests each were conducted to test for
   problem solving, association learning and social learning. We assessed
   consistency within each of these three domains and tested for cognitive
   and behavioural syndromes between domains. Problem solving and social
   learning were consistent across contexts and positively correlated with
   each other. In addition, both correlated positively with boldness, and
   problem solving showed a negative correlation with aggressiveness and
   sociopositive behaviour. Association learning was neither consistent nor
   correlated with personality or performance in the other cognition tasks.
   We showed contextual consistency of two cognitive traits and found
   multiple links to personality traits that were predicted by recent
   theory. Surprisingly, associative learning was not consistent,
   demonstrating the importance of testing the relation between personality
   and multiple cognitive traits to increase our understanding of
   individual variation in cognition and personality. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Lifelong effects of trapping experience lead to age-biased sampling:
   lessons from a wild bird population}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{133-139}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of individually marked animals is usually required
   for reliable estimation of numerous life history parameters. However,
   capture, marking and manipulation can dramatically alter the animals'
   behaviour after capture, and thus affect subsequent recapture success.
   Here, we used a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population as an
   example to illustrate the sampling bias resulting from the repeated
   capture of free-ranging individuals. By using repeated measures of the
   same individuals obtained during our long-term survey, we specifically
   evaluated the interannual response of breeding adults to capture-related
   stress, measured as latency to enter nestboxes equipped with a
   swing-trap. Moreover, we examined changes in the mean and variance of
   bird age with varying trapping effort using subsamples of the data set.
   Birds without any previous trapping experience entered nests more
   quickly than experienced ones, after controlling for other factors
   affecting latency, such as the sex, offspring quality and the order of
   capture relative to the other pair member. Birds' reluctance to enter
   the nest furthermore increased as the number of captures in previous
   years accumulated, implying that individual pied flycatchers became
   progressively more difficult to capture over the course of the study.
   Our results indicate that repeated exposure to capture stress over an
   animal's lifetime may induce long-lasting behavioural modifications that
   may influence trappability of the older segments of the population. We
   also provide evidence that this may ultimately lead to sampling bias
   towards younger ages, especially when effort is limited. We conclude
   that systematic age bias due to trapping experience can have important
   implications for the estimation of variation in a range of traits and
   should therefore be carefully checked in longitudinal studies. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{There is an increased focus in biology on consistent behavioural
   variation. Several terms are used to describe this variation, including
   animal personality and coping style. Both terms describe between
   individual consistency in behavioural variation; however, they differ in
   the behavioural assays typically used, the expected distribution of
   response variables, and whether they incorporate variation in
   behavioural flexibility. Despite these differences, the terms are often
   used interchangeably. We conducted experiments using juvenile and adult
   red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, as subjects to explore the degree to
   which animal personality and coping styles overlap. We demonstrate that
   animal personality and coping styles can be described in this species,
   and that shyer individuals had more flexible responses, as expected for
   coping styles. Behavioural responses from both personality and coping
   style assays had continuous distributions, and were not clearly
   separated into two types. Behavioural traits were not correlated and,
   hence, there was no evidence of a behavioural syndrome. Further,
   behavioural responses obtained in personality assays did not correlate
   with those from coping style tests. Animal personality and coping styles
   are therefore not synonymous in the red junglefowl. We suggest that the
   terms animal personality and coping style are not equivalent and should
   not be used interchangeably. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although aspects of an individual's state are well-known to influence
   the expression of behavior, it is still unclear how elements of state
   affect consistent among-individual differences in behavior. With binary,
   irreversible elements of state, such as mating status, there may be
   optimal behavioral phenotypes before and after mating, with individuals
   often prioritizing mate acquisition before and resource acquisition
   after. Yet, limited plasticity may prevent optimal behavior in both
   contexts. Additionally, it remains largely unknown if some consistencies
   in neural or physiological traits may limit the ability of the organism
   to respond to state changes. In this study, we investigated how changes
   in a binary state variable, mating status, affected both the mean
   expression and amongindividual variation in behavior and web structure
   of the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti. Furthermore, we explored
   the role of biogenic amines in potentially mediating individual
   differences in behavior and web structure. We found that mated females
   were overall more aggressive than virgin females and also built webs
   structured primarily for capturing prey rather than safety. We also
   found that individual differences in behavior and web structure were
   maintained across mating statuses, which indicates the stability of
   these traits and may drive personality-specific state-dependent fitness
   trade-offs. Finally, we found that aggressive spiders had higher central
   nervous system dopamine levels. Interestingly, web structure was often
   correlated with a catabolite of tyramine (N-acetyltyramine), suggesting
   that variation in amine catabolism, and not the concentrations of the
   amines themselves, may drive individual differences in some traits.
   Significance statement
   Our results demonstrate that although individuals show plasticity in
   response to changes in state, specifically mating status, individuals
   also maintain among-individual differences across this state change.
   Thus, aggressive individuals before mating will tend to be aggressive
   after. This maintenance of individual differences across state may drive
   differential fitness benefits before and after mating for different
   behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that biogenic amines and
   their catabolites are related to individual differences, thus
   identifying a potential mechanism underlying consistent variation.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's behavioural phenotype is a combination of its unique
   behavioural propensities and its responsiveness to environmental
   variation, also known as behavioural plasticity. In social species, we
   must not only explore how individuals respond to variations in the
   physical environment but also how they react to changes in their social
   environment. A growing body of work has demonstrated that the
   behavioural heterogeneity of a group can alter its responsiveness,
   decision making, and fitness. Whether an individual is more or less
   extreme than a partner - what we term its `relative personality' - may
   also alter individual behavioural responses. We determined exploratory
   tendencies of individual zebrafish (Danio rerio) and then constructed
   pairs with varying differences in `relative personality' to determine
   the effect of differences between partners on behavioural plasticity. We
   find that relative personality, but not the magnitude of the difference
   between partners, is the most important determinant of behavioural
   plasticity across social treatments. Despite this overall effect, pairs
   of fish exhibited no predictable leader follower interactions,
   suggesting that details of the experimental paradigm may be important in
   shaping social dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While differences in individual personality are common in animal
   populations, understanding the ecological significance of variation has
   not yet been resolved. Evidence suggests that personality may influence
   learning and memory; a finding that could improve our understanding of
   the evolutionary processes that produce and maintain intraspecific
   behavioural heterogeneity. Here, we tested whether boldness, the most
   studied personality trait in fish, could predict learning ability in
   brook trout. After quantifying boldness, fish were trained to find a
   hidden food patch in a maze environment. Stable landmark cues were
   provided to indicate the location of food and, at the conclusion of
   training, cues were rearranged to test for learning. There was a
   negative relationship between boldness and learning as shy fish were
   increasingly more successful at navigating the maze and locating food
   during training trials compared to bold fish. In the altered testing
   environment, only shy fish continued using cues to search for food.
   Overall, the learning rate of bold fish was found to be lower than that
   of shy fish for several metrics suggesting that personality could have
   widespread effects on behaviour. Because learning can increase
   plasticity to environmental change, these results have significant
   implications for fish conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Selecting a quality mate can involve acquiring and accessing large
   amounts of information; information that can be obtained either
   independently or socially. One means of learning about mates socially is
   to attend to other members of one's sex and copy their mate choices. It
   is possible however that not all individuals of a species benefit
   equally from, or are equally effective at, copying. We examined whether
   female guppies copied the mate choices of other females. Then, in a
   separate context we measured each female's `sociability': their
   proclivity to affiliate with other guppies. In the mate-choice copying
   procedure, `focal' females chose to spend time near two putative mates.
   Next, focals observed another (model) female interact with the focal's
   non-preferred male. Finally, the focal again chose between the same two
   males. For sociability, we examined the time focal females spent near a
   trio of other guppies. Females did indeed mate copy: they spent more
   time with their non-preferred male when a model female had been seen
   interacting with that male. The effect however was highly variable.
   Sociability significantly predicted the intensity of mate-choice
   copying. Results suggest that individuals vary consistently in the types
   of information they use when making mating decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent research has explored links between cognition and personality,
   with prominent hypotheses proposing that personality drives consistent
   individual differences in cognitive function. These hypotheses
   particularly expect bolder individuals to be faster, but less accurate,
   as a trade-off in cognitive function. However, cognitive processes are
   typically interconnected and defined in more complex terms than simply
   speed and accuracy. Here, we present evidence that personality-based
   differences in learning rates are a result of differences in
   decision-making during training in a two-alternative forced-choice
   spatial memory task. This was examined in the mormyrid fish Gnathonemus
   petersii in the presence of light, where both vision and the electric
   sense are available, and in the dark, where visibility is limited and
   fish rely mostly on electrosensing. The species is adapted for the dark
   to avoid visual predators; thus, the presence of light can induce
   high-risk and the dark low-risk. We show that light conditions had
   little effect on learning, with bolder fish learning faster both in the
   light and in the dark conditions. Yet the relationship between learning
   rates and error rates indicates that the effect on learning is
   indirectly influenced by accuracy during training. Speed-accuracy
   trade-offs were not found in decision-making, with bolder individuals
   deciding faster and more accurately both in the light and in the dark.
   Only learning strategy was affected by light conditions, with
   significantly more fish preferring response to place learning in the
   dark than in the light, where distal cues were not visible. We conclude
   that other than effects from the integration of visual information,
   bolder individuals show a consistently greater tendency to explore and
   find food rewards during training. This affects their decision-making
   and in turn their learning performance. We highlight the complexity by
   which personality-based effects are exhibited in spatial associative
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Having recognized that variation around the population-level ``Golden
   Mean{''} of labile traits contains biologically meaningful information,
   behavioural ecologists have focused increasingly on exploring the causes
   and consequences of individual variation in behaviour. These are
   exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the
   adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the
   partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It
   has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random
   effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example,
   between a personality trait and other individual traits such as
   cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these
   predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried
   forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from
   these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the
   problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by
   behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist
   within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Although much work has analysed how individual behavioural plasticity
   and adaptations to ecological conditions (e.g. density, sex-ratio,
   resource distribution) shape mating systems, few studies have assessed
   the relative importance of multiple factors in explaining why mating
   systems vary from one sub-population to the next even in the same
   ecological conditions. Differences among groups in their phenotypic
   composition, such as their average phenotype, within-group variation in
   phenotype, or the phenotype of individuals occupying key social roles
   might shape the mating system emerging at the group level and explain
   some portion of mating system variability. Here, we take advantage of
   the mating system flexibility of stream water striders (Aquarius
   remigis) to investigate how phenotypic composition affects the mating
   system emerging at the group level. Groups exhibited stable mating
   systems varying from scramble polygyny with intense sexual conflict, to
   systems with a clear dominant male guarding a ``harem{''} of females. We
   found that male size asymmetries and the personality of the largest
   individuals within groups had important effects on the group's mating
   system. The group's average male and female personality, size, and
   social plasticity also explained some of the variation in mating
   systems. Our study is one of the first to quantify significant
   relationships between group phenotypic composition and mating system
   variability.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes are correlations between behavioral traits, but
   their selective advantage under different environmental conditions is
   not well understood. Here, we used the pace-of-life hypothesis to
   predict how behavioral syndromes could vary along climatic gradients.
   This hypothesis states that populations experiencing different
   ecological conditions should differ in suites of physiological
   characteristics associated with behavioral and life-history traits. We
   examined the persistence of behavioral syndromes at multiple levels in
   the ant Temnothorax longispinosus along a climatic gradient in
   north-eastern USA. ``Across populations{''}, we predicted that proactive
   phenotypes, which show higher activity, aggression and exploration, are
   more likely to persist in warmer climates. ``Within populations{''}, we
   expected positive associations among proactive behaviors to be more
   pronounced at warmer sites. Additionally, we measured colony
   productivity to test whether deviation from the population-level
   syndrome influences their success, and whether such deviations could
   vary among populations. Behavioral syndromes clearly occurred across
   populations, with colonies from warmer environments exhibiting more
   exploration and foraging but slightly less aggressiveness than colonies
   from colder sites. However, the presence of behavioral syndromes within
   sites was population-specific. Positive associations between foraging,
   exploration and aggression, albeit rarely found, were more pronounced at
   the warmest sites, whereas negative associations were more common at
   colder sites. Furthermore, colonies from colder environments showed
   higher syndrome deviations than colonies from warmer environments, which
   may be linked to resource limitation and may also negatively affect
   colony productivity. This study partially corroborates the pace-of-life
   hypothesis and yields insights into the adaptive value of behavioral
   syndromes along climatic gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in
   repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly
   understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of
   adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable
   differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in
   repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body
   size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on
   personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual
   variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive
   colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1)
   test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal
   personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and
   boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes
   (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3)
   determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at
   the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation
   along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations
   did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural
   syndromes. Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance
   in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility
   and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations
   indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P.
   corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable
   between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test
   this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent
   individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to
   provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal
   personality. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {{To be so bold: boldness is repeatable and related to within individual
   behavioural variability in North Island robins}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural research traditionally focusses on the mean responses of a
   group of individuals rather than variation in behaviour around the mean
   or among individuals. However, examining the variation in behaviour
   among and within individuals may also yield important insights into the
   evolution and maintenance of behaviour. Repeatability is the most
   commonly used measure of variability among individuals in behavioural
   research. However, there are other forms of variation within populations
   that have received less attention. One such measure is intraindividual
   variation in behaviour (IIV), which is a short-term fluctuation of
   within-individual behaviour. Such variation in behaviour might be
   important during interactions because it could decrease the ability of
   conspecific and heterospecific individuals to predict the behaviour of
   the subject, thus increasing the cost of the interaction. In this
   experiment, we made repeated measures of the latency of North Island
   robins to attack a prey in a novel situation (a form of boldness) and
   examined (i) repeatability of boldness (the propensity to take a risk),
   (ii) IIV of boldness, and (iii) whether there was a significant
   relationship between these two traits (a behavioural syndrome). We found
   that boldness was highly repeatable, that there were high levels of IIV
   in boldness, and that there was a negative relationship between boldness
   and IN in boldness. This suggests that despite high levels of
   repeatability for this behaviour, there were also still significant
   differences in IIV among different individuals within the population.
   Moreover, bolder individuals had significantly less IW in their
   boldness, which suggests that they were forming routines (which reduces
   behavioural variability) compared to shyer individuals. Our results
   definitively demonstrate that IN itself varies across individuals and is
   linked with key behavioural traits, and we argue for the importance of
   future studies aimed at understanding its causes and consequences for
   behavioural interactions.}},

Title = {{Learning from the mistakes of others: How female elk (Cervus elaphus)
   adjust behaviour with age to avoid hunters}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{In animal behaviour, there is a dichotomy between innate behaviours (e.
   g., temperament or personality traits) versus those behaviours shaped by
   learning. Innate personality traits are supposedly less evident in
   animals when confounded by learning acquired with experience through
   time. Learning might play a key role in the development and adoption of
   successful anti-predator strategies, and the related adaptation has the
   potential to make animals that are more experienced less vulnerable to
   predation. We carried out a study in a system involving a large
   herbivorous mammal, female elk, Cervus elaphus, and their primary
   predator, i. e., human hunters. Using fine-scale satellite telemetry
   relocations, we tested whether differences in behaviour depending on age
   were due solely to selection pressure imposed by human hunters, meaning
   that females that were more cautious were more likely to survive and
   become older. Or whether learning also was involved, meaning that
   females adjusted their behaviour as they aged. Our results indicated
   that both human selection and learning contributed to the adoption of
   more cautious behavioural strategies in older females. Whereas human
   selection of behavioural traits has been shown in our previous research,
   we here provide evidence of additive learning processes being
   responsible for shaping the behaviour of individuals in this population.
   Female elk are indeed almost invulnerable to human hunters when older
   than 9 +/- 10 y. o., confirming that experience contributes to their
   survival. Female elk monitored in our study showed individually changing
   behaviours and clear adaptation as they aged, such as reduced movement
   rates (decreased likelihood of encountering human hunters), and
   increased use of secure areas (forest and steeper terrain), especially
   when close to roads. We also found that elk adjusted behaviours
   depending on the type of threat (bow and arrow vs. rifle hunters). This
   fine-tuning by elk to avoid hunters, rather than just becoming more
   cautious during the hunting season, highlights the behavioural
   plasticity of this species. Selection on behavioural traits and/or
   behavioural shifts via learning are an important but often-ignored
   consequence of human exploitation of wild animals. Such information is a
   critical component of the effects of human exploitation of wildlife
   populations with implications for improving their management and
   conservation.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities can influence social interactions among
   individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes
   and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the
   social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely
   focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here
   we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied
   personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great
   tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the
   exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the
   phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive
   breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that
   males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural
   phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities.
   This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest
   neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where
   neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further
   analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local
   environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more
   important than environmental variation in influencing male territory
   choice. This social organization during the breeding season has
   implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual
   selection on personality in wild animal populations. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Boldness: are open field and startle tests measuring the same
   personality trait?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{143-151}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Boldness, the willingness of individuals to engage in risky behaviour,
   is one of the most studied personality traits. It has been measured
   using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different
   assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted
   to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced
   mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under
   standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation.
   Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African
   striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open
   field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from
   startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of
   risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle
   tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During
   open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the
   wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature).
   During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a
   protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions)
   after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking
   behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were
   repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across
   contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of
   risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures,
   supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different
   personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two
   assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in
   the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle
   test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been studied extensively in recent years, yet
   multidimensionality in tendencies of risk-related behavior, and the role
   of such consistency from a mating tactics perspective, is yet to be
   investigated. We used a semi-domesticated herd of reindeer (Rangifer
   tarandus) to examine individual subdominant male propensity to risk
   mating attempts on guarded females, as well as flight initiation
   distance (FID), within the personality paradigm to elucidate potential
   fitness consequences of consistency from an adaptive perspective. Data
   were collected at the Kutuharju Reindeer Research Station in Kaamanen,
   Finland, where measures of personality were generated using field
   observation data based on the relative frequency of dominant
   male-subdominant male agonistic interactions over 4years and subdominant
   males' FID measured over 1year. Individual propensity for transient
   mating attempts was not significantly repeatable and did not
   significantly predict reproductive success or somatic cost during the
   mating season. Individuals varied consistently in FID, and although
   repeatable, FID was not related to reproductive success or somatic cost.
   Proximate state-dependent or social mechanisms may be driving
   decision-making with respect to mating effort, whereas consistent
   between-individual differences in FID may be maintained by mechanisms
   unrelated to life-history trade-offs involving productivity.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Many behavioural traits show important inter-individual phenotypic and
   genetic variation despite strong potential selection that should reduce
   this variability. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental
   conditions has been proposed to maintain such variation but empirical
   evidences supporting this hypothesis are still scarce for behavioural
   traits. Here, we analysed the repeatability and the ecological and
   individual factors that influence the expression of docility across
   different environmental contexts in wild eastern chipmunks (Tamias
   striatus) studied over a period of 10 years. We also estimated the
   heritability of docility and the patterns of viability selection acting
   on this trait for adults and juveniles. Docility was moderately
   repeatable among various contexts and was positively affected by age,
   was higher in males than that in females, was higher during the fall and
   decreased with population density. Heritability of docility was low at
   0.17. We found disruptive selection for the survival of adults only,
   individuals more or less docile than average having a higher survival.
   Our study confirms that docility is both phenotypically and genetically
   variables and that disruptive selection might maintain the variability
   in this trait.
   Significance statement
   Documenting the factors allowing the maintenance of phenotypic and
   genetic variation of behavioural traits within natural populations is a
   central objective in ecology and evolution. Here, we studied a wild
   eastern chipmunk population over 10 years and recorded docility, a
   personality trait, on both juveniles and adults. We showed that docility
   was repeatable and that it was also heritable and influenced by
   different individual and environmental factors. Importantly, we also
   found that disruptive viability selection was acting on adult docility
   independently of environmental variations. Our results show that
   docility is both phenotypically and genetically variable and that
   patterns of selection acting on this trait can maintain personality
   heterogeneity across temporally varying environmental conditions in the
   wild.}},

Title = {{Development of behavioural profile in the Northern common boa (Boa
   imperator): Repeatable independent traits or personality?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate
   causation and ecological and evolutionary significance in particular,
   but the question of its development was largely overlooked. The
   attributes of personality are defined as between-individual differences
   in behaviour, which are consistent over time (differential consistency)
   and contexts (contextual generality) and both can be affected by
   development. We assessed several candidates for personality variables
   measured in various tests with different contexts over several
   life-stages (juveniles, older juveniles, subadults and adults) in the
   Northern common boa. Variables describing foraging/feeding decision and
   some of the defensive behaviours expressed as individual average values
   are highly repeatable and consistent. We found two main personality
   axes-one associated with foraging/feeding and the speed of decision, the
   other reflecting agonistic behaviour. Intensity of behaviour in the
   feeding context changes during development, but the level of agonistic
   behaviour remains the same. The juveniles and adults have a similar
   personality structure, but there is a period of structural change of
   behaviour during the second year of life (subadults). These results
   require a new theoretical model to explain the selection pressures
   resulting in this developmental pattern of personality. We also studied
   the proximate factors and their relationship to behavioural
   characteristics. Physiological parameters (heart and breath rate stress
   response) measured in adults clustered with variables concerning the
   agonistic behavioural profile, while no relationship between the
   juvenile/adult body size and personality concerning feeding/foraging and
   the agonistic behavioural profile was found. Our study suggests that it
   is important for studies of personality development to focus on both the
   structural and differential consistency, because even though behaviour
   is differentially consistent, the structure can change.}},

Title = {{Development of the ``Highly Sensitive Dog{''} questionnaire to evaluate
   the personality dimension ``Sensory Processing Sensitivity{''} in dogs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{In humans, the personality dimension `sensory processing sensitivity
   (SPS)', also referred to as ``high sensitivity{''}, involves deeper
   processing of sensory information, which can be associated with
   physiological and behavioral overarousal. However, it has not been
   studied up to now whether this dimension also exists in other species.
   SPS can influence how people perceive the environment and how this
   affects them, thus a similar dimension in animals would be highly
   relevant with respect to animal welfare. We therefore explored whether
   SPS translates to dogs, one of the primary model species in personality
   research. A 32-item questionnaire to assess the ``highly sensitive dog
   score{''} (HSD-s) was developed based on the ``highly sensitive
   person{''} (HSP) questionnaire. A large-scale, international online
   survey was conducted, including the HSD questionnaire, as well as
   questions on fearfulness, neuroticism, ``demographic{''} (e.g. dog sex,
   age, weight; age at adoption, etc.) and ``human{''} factors (e.g. owner
   age, sex, profession, communication style, etc.), and the HSP
   questionnaire. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effect models with
   forward stepwise selection to test prediction of HSD-s by the
   above-mentioned factors, with country of residence and dog breed treated
   as random effects. A total of 3647 questionnaires were fully completed.
   HSD-, fearfulness, neuroticism and HSP-scores showed good internal
   consistencies, and HSD-s only moderately correlated with fearfulness and
   neuroticism scores, paralleling previous findings in humans. Intra- (N =
   447) and inter-rater (N = 120) reliabilities were good. Demographic and
   human factors, including HSP score, explained only a small amount of the
   variance of HSD-s. A PCA analysis identified three subtraits of SPS,
   comparable to human findings. Overall, the measured personality
   dimension in dogs showed good internal consistency, partial independence
   from fearfulness and neuroticism, and good intra-and inter-rater
   reliability, indicating good construct validity of the HSD
   questionnaire. Human and demographic factors only marginally affected
   the HSD-s suggesting that, as hypothesized for human SPS, a genetic
   basis may underlie this dimension within the dog species.}},

Title = {{Personality in the cockroach Diploptera punctata: Evidence for stability
   across developmental stages despite age effects on boldness}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Despite a recent surge in the popularity of animal personality studies
   and their wide-ranging associations with various aspects of behavioural
   ecology, our understanding of the development of personality over
   ontogeny remains poorly understood. Stability over time is a central
   tenet of personality; ecological pressures experienced by an individual
   at different life stages may, however, vary considerably, which may have
   a significant effect on behavioural traits. Invertebrates often go
   through numerous discrete developmental stages and therefore provide a
   useful model for such research. Here we test for both differential
   consistency and age effects upon behavioural traits in the gregarious
   cockroach Diploptera punctata by testing the same behavioural traits in
   both juveniles and adults. In our sample, we find consistency in
   boldness, exploration and sociality within adults whilst only boldness
   was consistent in juveniles. Both boldness and exploration measures,
   representative of risk-taking behaviour, show significant consistency
   across discrete juvenile and adult stages. Age effects are, however,
   apparent in our data; juveniles are significantly bolder than adults,
   most likely due to differences in the ecological requirements of these
   life stages. Size also affects risk-taking behaviour since smaller
   adults are both bolder and more highly explorative. Whilst a behavioural
   syndrome linking boldness and exploration is evident in nymphs, this
   disappears by the adult stage, where links between other behavioural
   traits become apparent. Our results therefore indicate that differential
   consistency in personality can be maintained across life stages despite
   age effects on its magnitude, with links between some personality traits
   changing over ontogeny, demonstrating plasticity in behavioural
   syndromes.}},

Title = {{Early social isolation impairs development, mate choice and grouping
   behaviour of predatory mites}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{15-21}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The social environment early in life is a key determinant of
   developmental, physiological and behavioural trajectories across
   vertebrate and invertebrate animals. One crucial variable is the
   presence/absence of conspecifics. For animals usually reared in groups,
   social isolation after birth or hatching can be a highly stressful
   circumstance, with potentially long-lasting consequences. Here, we
   assessed the effects of social deprivation (isolation) early in life,
   that is, absence of conspecifics, versus social enrichment, that is,
   presence of conspecifics, on developmental time, body size at maturity,
   mating behaviour and groupliving in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite
   Phytoseiulus persimilis. Socially deprived protonymphs developed more
   slowly and were less socially competent in grouping behaviour than
   socially enriched protonymphs. Compromised social competence in grouping
   behaviour was evident in decreased activity, fewer mutual encounters and
   larger interindividual distances, all of which may entail severe fitness
   costs. In female choice/male competition, socially deprived males mated
   earlier than socially enriched males; in male choice/female competition,
   socially deprived females were more likely to mate than socially
   enriched females. In neither mate choice situation did mating duration
   or body size at maturity differ between socially deprived and enriched
   mating opponents. Social isolation-induced shifts in mating behaviour
   may be interpreted as increased attractiveness or competitiveness or,
   more likely, as hastiness and reduced ability to assess mate quality.
   Overall, many of the social isolation-induced behavioural changes in P.
   persimilis are analogous to those observed in other animals such as
   cockroaches, fruit flies, fishes or rodents. We argue that, due to their
   profound and persistent effects, early social deprivation or enrichment
   may be important determinants in shaping animal personalities. (C) 2017

   differences in personality types}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{125-134}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities have been studied extensively in the last decade.
   It is still not entirely understood, however, how different
   personalities evolve and persist. The social niche specialization
   hypothesis suggests that in group-living animals the combination of
   social conflicts and alternative options on how to deal with them are of
   key importance for the development and evolution of animal personality.
   Here we predicted that, following the social niche specialization
   hypothesis, a more social species should have more pronounced
   personality differences. We tested this prediction using four species of
   shrews that differ in ecology and sociability. Three species (Neomys
   fodiens, Sorex araneus and Sorex minutus) are strictly solitary outside
   the breeding season; the fourth species (Neomys anomalus) is
   intraspecifically more tolerant and able to live in groups. These four
   species offer a good model to assess our questions as N. anomalus can,
   in many other respects (e.g. body size, habitat, foraging mode), be
   considered as an `inbetween' species. We tested individuals of all
   species for their solitary activity and their activity and agonistic
   behaviour in within- and between-species dyadic encounters. We found
   that individuals of N. anomalus, but not the other species tested,
   showed consistent behavioural variation in agonistic behaviour.
   Consistent individual differences in activity were, however, also
   present in other species and activity was further correlated between the
   different contexts in all tested species. Finding more pronounced
   personality differences in N. anomalus than in the other, less sociable
   species supports the hypothesis that social niche specialization can
   influence the evolution of animal personalities. (C) 2017 The

   hoverflies}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{187-195}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many animals differ consistently in the way they behave across time and
   context. This animal personality has been linked to traits such as life
   history strategies or dispersal. However, few studies have addressed the
   relationship between consistent behavioural differences and migration.
   This is of particular interest with respect to partial migration, in
   which only part of a population migrates while the other remains
   resident. We investigated whether two behavioural traits (activity and
   stress response) are consistent across time in individuals of two
   partially migratory hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Scaeva
   selenitica. We also investigated whether there were consistent
   behavioural differences between migratory and resident flies within
   species. Individual activity was consistent across time in both species.
   Additionally, activity of female E. balteatus differed between the
   phenotypes, with summer insects being more active than migrating and
   overwintering individuals in our assays. Furthermore, females of S.
   selenitica were more active and less easily stressed than E. balteatus.
   The results not only highlight that hoverflies behave consistently
   across time, but also that behavioural differences also occur between
   migratory and resident flies. They also provide evidence for the
   possible role of behavioural differences in influencing partial
   migration decisions within populations. (C) 2017 The Association for the

Abstract = {{The field of animal personalities claims to fill a gap in our
   understanding of animal behavior, because it explicitly studies the
   adaptive significance of behavioral differences. This is a controversial
   claim given that the field of behavioral ecology firmly places the study
   of animal behavior in an evolutionary context. In fact, it is the
   evolutionary context that differentiates behavioral ecology from
   ethology and animal behavior, 2 fields that were already concerned with
   the study of behavior in nonhuman animals. So, if behavioral ecology
   already takes an evolutionary approach to variation in behavior, we ask
   what is personality research about exactly? This question is
   particularly pertinent now the focus of personality research shifts and
   the field moves away from being mainly descriptive to include
   quantitative frameworks. As a result, the field has come to borrow
   heavily from already established fields. In our view, this has resulted
   in ``animal personality{''} studies becoming nothing more than a
   rebranding of existing fields of research-fields that are far more
   solidly grounded and hypothesis driven than the often vague and
   superficial focus on animal personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying consistent differences in behaviour among individuals is
   vital to understanding the ecological and evolutionary significance of
   animal personality. To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of
   a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among
   individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are
   available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to
   estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the
   repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows
   for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon,
   enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively
   breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin
   Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different
   life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state
   could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the
   population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4
   behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object
   exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and
   narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer
   variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable
   behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation
   between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in
   other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately
   repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual
   correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object
   exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately
   heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance). This
   study further clarifies the additive genetic variance available for
   selection to act upon in this cooperatively breeding bird.}},

Abstract = {{Individual animal personalities interact with environmental conditions
   to generate differences in behavior, a phenomenon of growing interest
   for understanding the effects of environmental enrichment on captive
   animals. Wheels are common environmental enrichment for laboratory
   rodents, but studies conflict on how this influences behavior, and
   interaction of wheels with individual personalities has rarely been
   examined. We examined whether wheel access altered personality profiles
   in adult Siberian dwarf hamsters. We assayed animals in a tunnel maze
   twice for baseline personality, then again at two and at seven weeks
   after the experimental group was provisioned with wheels in their home
   cages. Linear mixed model selection was used to assess changes in
   behavior over time and across environmental gradient of wheel exposure.
   While animals showed consistent inter-individual differences in
   activity, activity personality did not change upon exposure to a wheel.
   Boldness also varies among individuals, and there is evidence for female
   boldness scores converging after wheel exposure, that is, opposite
   shifts in behavior by high and low boldness individuals, although sample
   size is too small for the mixed model results to be robust. In general,
   Siberian dwarf hamsters appear to show low behavioral plasticity,
   particularly in general activity, in response to running wheels. (C)

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{There has been extensive game-theoretic modelling of conditions leading
   to equilibria of producer-scrounger dichotomies in groups. However there
   is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations.
   Here, we examine producer-scrounger games in five subpopulations of
   birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a
   bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas,
   with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization
   persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory
   personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the
   foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to
   adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also
   important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher
   social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within
   subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and
   be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare
   example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer-scrounger
   tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple
   scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the
   frequency of scroungers increases with group size.}},

Title = {{Understanding repeatability and plasticity in multiple dimensions of the
   sociability of wild female kangaroos}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sociability, how individuals interact with conspecifics, is considered
   to be a key axis of animal personality. Consistent differences between
   individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some
   taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability
   across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious
   species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although
   repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both
   important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been
   studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple
   behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is
   still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of
   sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to
   determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two
   broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population
   of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to
   investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals'
   states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected
   each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed
   factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to
   reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different
   conspecifics with which individuals associated (their `choosiness' of
   social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were
   all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older
   dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more
   selective about group members when there was more food, and when they
   were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences
   exist among females in this population, and females' measures of
   sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long
   term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals'
   states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females'
   patterns of sociability over shorter periods. (C) 2017 The Association

Abstract = {{Neophobia is an important personality trait that allows animals to
   minimize exposure to threat. We investigated the existence of consistent
   individual differences in the level of neophobia in captive roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective
   was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with
   behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful
   situation, i.e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of
   neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a
   feeding bout and the feeding efficiency over bouts both decreased in the
   presence of a novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in
   the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental
   treatment. First, feeding efficiency decreased the most among
   individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation
   (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding
   bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher
   concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic
   stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic
   (high latency to first feeding bout and low feeding efficiency in the
   presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural
   response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the
   existence of a behavioural syndrome. We conclude that behavioural and
   physiological parameters measured during capture provide reliable
   indicators of neophobia for roe deer, providing an exciting new avenue
   for the study of animal personality in the wild. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{145-151}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Modern life history theory hypothesizes that pace of life is a strong
   predictor of life history traits. Recently, the notion that life history
   studies should integrate animal behaviour has emerged, because
   between-individual differences in behaviour are often coupled with
   fitness differences. So far, studies have mainly focused on interspecies
   or interpopulation perspectives, and research on the effects of life
   history differences on individual behaviour remain scarce. In the
   present study we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how pace of
   life is related to consistent individual behaviour. We investigated the
   relationship between developmental speed and consistent behaviour of the
   field wolf spider, Pardosa agrestis. In this species, individuals
   originating from the same clutch can typically follow either a slow or a
   rapid developmental pathway, characterized by a developmental time of
   about 10 or 3 months, respectively. We found that spiders, regardless of
   their developmental speed, behaved consistently in most of the tests.
   Our results also show that individuals developing rapidly were
   significantly more active during exploration and more successful in
   prey-catching tests than slowly developing spiders. Although rapidly
   developing spiders were bolder in one of the tests, this difference did
   not persist over the repeated measurements. Our work seems to support
   the notion that pace of life and animal personality are correlated, and
   pace of life might predict the behavioural types of individuals. (C)

Title = {{Mate choice based on behavioural type: do convict cichlids prefer
   similar partners?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{281-291}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In monogamous species that provide biparental care, partners with
   similar behavioural types generally have a better reproductive success
   than dissimilar ones. The pattern of assortative mating for behavioural
   type is thus often interpreted as resulting from a mate choice process.
   However, an alternative process is also possible when the partners
   become similar through postpairing adjustments (behavioural
   convergence). The disentanglement of these two nonexclusive mechanisms
   is an important evolutionary question. Only sexual selection based on
   behavioural similarity before pairing can explain the maintenance of the
   behavioural type variability. In a previous study, we reported the
   existence of behavioural convergence for aggressiveness between partners
   in convict cichlids Amatitlania siquia, a monogamous tropical fish. We
   tested herein the assumption of mate choice based on behavioural
   similarity for aggressiveness using either short-term binary choice or
   long-term group level pairing. Pairing was not based on behavioural
   similarity between potential partners. Choosing a behaviourally
   compatible partner is a complex task because it requires profiling the
   potential mates. Individuals would thus achieve higher fitness benefits
   from choosing a partner on more conspicuous criteria (such as size for
   instance) and then attempt to increase partner similarity by convergence
   after pairing. Sexual selection does not appear to drive the maintenance
   of aggressiveness type variability in convict cichlids. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Effects of captivity on house mice behaviour in a novel environment:
   Implications for conservation practices}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{98-106}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Captive breeding programmes offer a method for preventing the extinction
   of threatened species, but often have difficulty establishing
   self-sustaining populations and generating individuals for release. This
   difficulty can arise because the behaviour of captive-reared animals
   differs from wild animals. Whilst the effect of captivity on animal
   behaviour has been widely reported, few studies have explicitly compared
   differences between captive-reared and wild-caught animals. Even fewer
   have examined behavioural types (a composition of behavioural traits)
   displayed in novel environments, which is particularly relevant for
   determining reintroduction success. Further, the transgenerational
   effects on behavioural type, and potential differences between sexes in
   response to captivity, remain almost completely unknown. Using house
   mouse (Mus musculus) as a model for small mammals, we tested whether
   behavioural types displayed in a novel environment differed between
   captive-reared and wild-caught animals. In addition, it was tested
   whether behavioural types were subject to transgenerational effects in
   captivity, and whether there were sex-specific differences in
   behavioural types. We used an open field test to simulate a novel
   environment. Captive-reared mice were found to differ in their boldness
   and activity behavioural type compared to their wild-caught mice (p <
   0.001). There was marginal evidence for transgenerational effects on
   behavioural type in captivity, but three behavioural traits displayed a
   shift away from wild behaviours (\% Time active: p < 0.001; \% Time
   mobile: p = 0.004; Centre: maximum speed: p = 0.004). Furthermore,
   behavioural types of individuals in captivity did not differ depending
   on sex (F-0: p = 0.161; F-1: p = 0.665), however behavioural type did
   differ between wild-caught females and males (p = 0.015). These findings
   suggest that captivity can result in behavioural changes and loss of
   sex-specific behaviours. In addition, phenotypic plasticity may have a
   significant influence on behavioural type. This knowledge may be
   critical for developing methods to improve small mammal reintroduction
   programmes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of among-individual variation and
   covariation in behaviours are of substantial interest to behavioural
   ecology, but the proximate mechanisms underpinning this (co) variation
   are still unclear. Previous research suggests metabolic rate as a
   potential proximate mechanism to explain behavioural covariation. We
   measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR), boldness and exploration in
   western stutter-trilling crickets, Gryllus integer, selected
   differentially for short and fast development over two generations.
   After applying mixed-effects models to reveal the sign of the
   covariation, we applied structural equation models to an
   individual-level covariance matrix to examine whether the RMR generates
   covariation between the measured behaviours. All traits showed
   among-individual variation and covariation: RMR and boldness were
   positively correlated, RMR and exploration were negatively correlated,
   and boldness and exploration were negatively correlated. However, the
   RMR was not a causal factor generating covariation between boldness and
   exploration. Instead, the covariation between all three traits was
   explained by another, unmeasured mechanism. The selection lines differed
   from each other in all measured traits and significantly affected the
   covariance matrix structure between the traits, suggesting that there is
   a genetic component in the trait integration. Our results emphasize that
   interpretations made solely from the correlation matrix might be
   misleading.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental heterogeneity can result in spatial variation in selection
   pressures that can produce local adaptations. The pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis predicts that habitat-specific selective pressures will favor
   the coevolution of personality, physiological, and life-history
   phenotypes. Few studies so far have compared these traits simultaneously
   across different ecological conditions. In this study, we compared 3
   personality traits (handling aggression, exploration speed in a novel
   environment, and nest defense behavior) and 1 physiological trait (heart
   rate during manual restraint) across 3 Corsican blue tit (Cyanistes
   caeruleus) populations. These populations are located in contrasting
   habitats (evergreen vs. deciduous) and are situated in 2 different
   valleys 25 km apart. Birds from these populations are known to differ in
   life-history characteristics, with birds from the evergreen habitat
   displaying a slow pace-of-life, and birds from the deciduous habitat a
   comparatively faster pace-of-life. We expected personality to differ
   across populations, in line with the differences in pace-of-life
   documented for life-history traits. As expected, we found behavioral
   differences among populations. Despite considerable temporal variation,
   birds exhibited lower handling aggression in the evergreen populations.
   Exploration speed and male heart rate also differed across populations,
   although our results for exploration speed were more consistent with a
   phenotypic difference between the 2 valleys than between habitats. There
   were no clear differences in nest defense intensity among populations.
   Our study emphasizes the role of environmental heterogeneity in shaping
   population divergence in personality traits at a small spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{There has been an increasing interest in consistent interindividual
   differences in behavior (i.e., personality) in recent years. However,
   consistent interindividual differences in cognitive styles remain
   largely unexplored. Individual differences in cognitive styles are
   hypothesized to be functionally related to differences in personality
   types. It is assumed that proactive individuals make faster decisions at
   the expense of accuracy (i.e., the speed-accuracy trade-offs
   hypothesis). Here, we investigated the relationship between personality
   and speed-accuracy trade-off using Portia labiata, a specialized
   spider-eating jumping spider that exhibits excellent cognitive ability.
   We first established consistent individual differences in aggressiveness
   and decision-making in P. labiata. We then tested whether individual
   differences in aggressiveness could predict how fast and accurately P.
   labiata makes a prey-choice decision (a large vs. a small orb-web
   spider). We demonstrated that P. labiata exhibited individual
   differences not only in aggressiveness, but also in the speed of
   prey-choice decisions but not in the choices. Importantly, we found that
   aggressiveness was not related to the choice of the prey, but it
   predicted the speed of prey-choice decision: aggressive individuals were
   faster to make choices than docile ones but both chose large spiders as
   preferred prey. This suggests a lack of an association between a
   speed-accuracy trade-off and variation in personality types of P.
   labiata.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary theory predicts that when intrasexual competition is
   intense, risky behaviors can evolve if they enhance reproductive
   success. Here we tested the idea that polygynous males exhibit
   predictable variation in risk-taking during intense competition for
   mates. We conducted an observational study of a village weaverbird
   (Ploceus cucullatus) breeding colony, and video recorded synchronous
   fleeing events, a common predator avoidance behavior. Males adjusted
   their flight from the colony according to the amplitude (loudness) and
   Wiener entropy (harshness) of conspecific alarm calls during a perceived
   threat. Males also varied in how often they fled the colony.
   Specifically, in line with predictions based on the value of a male's
   territory, males with more nesting females were less likely to flee, and
   returned sooner if they did flee, compared to males with fewer nesting
   females. Males with a nest under construction also returned to their
   nests sooner than males without constructions in progress, consistent
   with predictions based on nest sabotage by conspecifics. These results
   suggest that male weavers perform a cost-benefit analysis in real time
   in order to decide how to respond to a perceived threat, with
   self-protection trading off with the security of one's territory and
   mates.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The presence of variation in behavior on the betweenindividual level is
   considered the hallmark of personality. In contrast, behavioral
   syndromes are commonly recognized when documented on the phenotypic
   level, which is a mix of between- individual and residual
   (within-individual) correlations. Phenotypic and between- individual
   correlations need not align, and investigations on different levels of
   the same syndrome may hence lead to opposite inferences.
   Between-individual correlations, arguably, provide stronger evidence for
   an intrinsically determined behavioral syndrome than phenotypic
   correlations. We compiled 109 literature estimates of between-
   individual and phenotypic correlations between behaviors from 30
   studies, performed on 22 species covering a wide range of taxa. Contrary
   to our expectation, the phenotypic correlation in behaviors was, on
   average, a reasonable predictor of the between- individual correlation
   in terms of magnitude and sign. Although our finding does not warrant
   the use of the phenotypic correlation as a suitable approximation of the
   between- individual correlation for any particular study, it does
   suggest that the phenotypic correlations used to infer the majority of
   behavioral syndromes to date have provided a reasonable characterization
   of syndrome associative strength.}},

   sticklebacks}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Coping styles theory provides a framework for understanding individual
   variation in how animals respond to environmental change, and predicts
   how individual differences in stress responsiveness and behavior might
   relate to cognitive differences. According to coping styles theory,
   proactive individuals are bolder, less reactive to stressors, and more
   routinized than their reactive counterparts. A key tenet of coping
   styles theory is that variation in coping styles is maintained by
   tradeoffs with behavioral flexibility: proactive individuals excel in
   stable environments while more flexible, reactive individuals perform
   better in variable environments. Here, we assess evidence for coping
   styles within a natural population of threespined sticklebacks
   (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We developed a criterion-based learning
   paradigm to evaluate individual variation in initial and reversal
   learning. We observed strong individual differences in boldness,
   cortisol production, and learning performance. Consistent with coping
   styles, fish that released more cortisol were more timid in response to
   a predator attack and slower to learn a color discrimination task.
   However, there was no evidence that reactive individuals performed
   better when the environment changed (when the rewarded color was
   reversed). The failure to detect trade-offs between behavioral
   routinization and flexibility prompts other explanations for the
   maintenance of differing coping styles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Due in part to their large size, aggressive temperament, and difficulty
   in handling, there are few physiological studies of adult crocodilians
   in the literature. As a result, studies comparing individuals across an
   ontogenetic series and comparisons among species are also lacking. We
   addressed this gap in knowledge by measuring standard metabolic rates
   (SMR) of three species of crocodilians (Crocodylus porosus, C. johnsoni,
   and Alligator mississippiensis), and included individuals that ranged
   from 0.22 to 114 kg. Allometric scaling of SMR with body mass was
   similar among the species, but C. porosus had significantly higher SMR
   than did C. johnsoni or A. mississippiensis. Differences in SMR among
   species are potentially related to behavioural differences in levels of
   aggression; C. porosus are the most aggressive of the crocodilians
   measured, and have rates of standard metabolism that are approximately
   36\% higher at the grand mean body size than those measured for C.
   johnsoni or A. mississippiensis, which are among the least aggressive

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Abstract = {{A group's composition is important for its success. Colonies of the
   spider Anelosimus studiosus appear to have responded to this pressure by
   evolving the ability to maintain mixtures of docile versus aggressive
   individuals that help colonies avoid extinction. Here we demonstrate
   that colony extinction events unite the optimal group composition of all
   colony constituents, regardless of phenotype, with that of the colony as
   a whole. This is because colony extinction events explain the majority
   of individual mortality events in A. studiosus. Through within-and
   across-habitat colony manipulations, we further determined that
   reduction in reproductive output by individuals bearing overabundant
   phenotypes underlies the ability of colonies to adaptively regulate
   their compositions. When we experimentally created colonies with an
   overabundance of the docile or aggressive phenotype, individuals bearing
   the overabundant phenotype exhibited reduced reproductive output, which
   helped to move colony compositions back towards their site-specific
   optima. Colonies displaced from their native sites continued to recreate
   the patterns of reproductive output that characterized their site of
   origin, suggesting a genetic component to this trait. Individuals thus
   appear to adaptively cull their reproductive output depending on their
   phenotype and the composition of their colony. There is also
   considerable parent-offspring colony resemblance in the extent to which
   colonies can or do track their ideal compositions. This conveys a kind
   of collective heritability to this trait. Together, while group
   selection appears to be the principal driver of ongoing selection on
   group composition in A. studiosus, patterns of selection among
   individuals within groups appear to promote colonies' ability to track
   their ideal mixtures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {{Self-feeding behaviour and personality traits in tilapia: A comparative

Abstract = {{Hybridization aims at combining valuable traits from two species into a
   single group. Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (NT) and Black-chinned
   tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (BCT) are respectively characterized
   by fast growth and water salinity tolerance which attract the breeders
   who could take advantage of both species. The first step is to
   characterize both species behavior in different contexts. The aim of
   this study was to compare the self-feeding behaviour between NT and BCT
   with a design allowing to reveal individual and group feed demand
   behaviour and then to identify the individual specialization that builds
   around the device and the Mod dispenser. The second objective was to
   estimate the links between the individual specialization and personality
   traits. To this aim, we recorded feed demand behaviour of both species
   using a computerized self-feeding device (two tanks for each species
   containing 20 PIT-tagged individuals with a male-female ratio of about
   47\%). Personality traits of all individuals were subsequently
   characterized with an open field test (OFT). The links between
   feed-demand and personality were then analyzed. Growth performances were
   not significantly different between NT and BCT but there was a strong
   tank effect. The individual specialization was similar in NT and BCT
   and,similar to that previously observed in sea bass i.e. 1-3 individuals
   responsible for most of the feed demand activity in the tanks. Most NT
   individuals stayed in the shelter during the open field test while most
   of BCT individuals moved out of it. Overall, NT were shyer than BCT or
   the OFT was not adapted to NT. Linking the results of the self-feeding
   experiment and OFT in BCT, we found a strong positive correlation
   between the triggering activity and females' shyness. Fish that spent
   more time inside than outside the shelter and which latency to emerge
   from shelter was longer, were characterized by a higher triggering
   activity (high-triggering fish). This study confirms the NT ability to
   use self-feeder devices and provides the first insight into the same
   ability in BCT and demonstrates links with personality traits. These
   results have a potential interest for the success of BCT and NT
   hybridization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality studies rely on collecting repeated behavioural data
   either in the field or under laboratory conditions. Conditions in the
   field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions,
   and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here
   we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally
   compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and
   the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a
   design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of
   sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the
   field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We
   analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including
   repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components.
   Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory
   and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across
   situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods
   of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this
   effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to
   laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was
   stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those
   that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that
   although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results
   like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of
   consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction
   between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals
   are observed. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Individual natal dispersal behaviour is often difficult to predict as it
   can be influenced by multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors.
   Individual differences in personality have been shown to be an important
   correlate of dispersal behaviour. However, the relationships between
   personality traits and dispersal are often inconsistent within and
   across studies and the causes of these discrepancies are often unknown.
   Here we sought to determine how individual differences in activity and
   aggression, as measured in an open-field trial, were related to natal
   dispersal distance in a wild population of North American red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). For 14 cohorts, while individual aggression
   consistently had no association with dispersal distance, the association
   between activity and dispersal fluctuated through time, mediated by
   population density. The environmental-dependence of the relationship
   between personality and dispersal in this population is indicative of
   the importance of considering external conditions when predicting
   dispersal behaviour.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{154}},

Pages = {{853-874}},
Abstract = {{Consistent and correlated inter-individual differences in behaviours,
   the so-called `personalities', have been identified in many vertebrates.
   The ability to respond to stressful events is part of personalities and
   can have important fitness consequences, as it determines how
   individuals cope with environmental challenges. As a consequence of
   pleiotropic effects of genes involved in several functions,
   inter-individual differences in behavioural responses can be associated
   with phenotypic traits, like melanin-based plumage colouration in birds.
   We examined the association between three proxies of the behavioural
   stress response and breast plumage colouration in barn swallow (Hirundo
   rustica) nestlings. We found that nestling behavioural responses were
   consistent within individuals and similar among siblings, thus
   suggesting that these behaviours may contribute to define individual
   `personalities'. However, nestling behavioural stress response was not
   significantly predicted by variation in breast plumage colouration,
   indicating that in juveniles of this species melanin-based colouration
   does not convey to conspecifics reliable information on individual
   ability to cope with stressful events.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research in behavioural ecology has revealed the structure of
   animal personality and connections to ecologically and evolutionarily
   important traits. Personality is hypothesized to influence social
   interactions through individual behavioural differences or

   a role in the strength or pattern of social associations in a wild
   population of degus, a rodent that often lives communally with unrelated
   conspecifics. Boldness was repeatable in both adults and juveniles, but
   exploration was only repeatable in adults. We found evidence for a
   behavioural syndrome between exploration and boldness in adult degus. We
   documented negative assortment by exploratory personality type; more
   exploratory animals shared burrows with less exploratory animals.
   However, tendency towards boldness and exploration were not predictive
   of association strength. Our results highlight a potential connection
   between personality and social structure in a communally nesting

Abstract = {{One possibility for why individual differences in behavioral plasticity
   are frequently associated with differences in personality might be that
   variation in personality is functionally related to variation in
   cognition. Evidence supporting a link between personality and cognition,
   however, is still limited and contradictory. In this study, we then
   conducted a laboratory experiment with zebra finches (Taeniopygia
   guttata) aimed at examining the role of cognition in shaping individual
   differences in contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in behavior
   between contexts). Specifically, we measured neophobia by quantifying
   the latency of the birds to eat near a novel object in two different
   environments across a social gradient and assessed their learning
   performance on two discriminant tasks and a reversal task. In agreement
   with our expectation, we found that less neophobic individuals were less
   plastic in their responses compared to more neophobic ones. Less
   neophobic individuals were also faster to reach the learning criterion
   but only in the less difficult discriminant task they performed first.
   On the contrary, although we found evidence for individual consistency
   in learning performances, differences among individuals in the number of
   trials needed to pass the task in both the more difficult discriminant
   and reversal tasks were not associated with individual differences in
   neophobia. Thus, our findings indicate that individual differences in
   contextual plasticity do not necessarily result from some individuals
   being more sensitive to environmental changes. Instead, we suggest that
   differences among individuals in their level of plasticity might result
   from differences in the number of suitable habitats they may occupy.}},

Abstract = {{In many animal taxa, behavior varies both among individuals (animal
   ``personalities{''}) and within individuals ({''}plasticity{''}).
   Personality and plasticity may co-vary if individuals differ in
   responsiveness to changes in their environment ({''}I x E{''}
   interaction). The nature and fitness implications of individual
   differences in behavioral plasticity in the wild are poorly understood.
   In territorial animals, fitness depends fundamentally on
   resource-defense behavior-their response to various threats from
   conspecific competitors. Such systems thus offer an ideal opportunity to
   investigate individual differences in behavioral plasticity. We used
   male superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) to test for individual
   differences in the intensity and plasticity of territorial defense
   behavior. Using captive assays, we identified behavioral types on the
   basis of fast versus slow exploration of a novel environment (the
   ``proactive-reactive{''} axis of behavior). Then we simulated
   territorial intrusions in the wild, using playback of experimentally
   manipulated songs that differed in trill length in a pair-wise design.
   Although previous work suggests that proactive individuals are more
   aggressive and less responsive than reactive individuals, we found no
   support for these differences in the context of territorial defense in
   the wild. Fast explorers (proactive) and slow explorers (reactive)
   responded equally aggressively to a simulated territorial intrusion
   overall. Furthermore, although fast explorers responded equally strongly
   to the two different playback stimuli, there was little evidence that
   slow explorers differentiated between the two stimuli, and this ``I x
   E{''} interaction was not statistically significant. Further work is
   needed to determine the prevalence in the wild of personality-related

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative
   tendencies. We discuss the broader evolutionary and ecological
   implications of our findings and propose that changes in social status
   should be considered when investigating behavioral syndromes and the
   interplay between animal personality and behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis for behavioral
   variation, the effects of the developmental environment on the
   maintenance and generation of behavioral variation across multiple
   traits remain poorly resolved. We investigated how nutritional status
   during development affected behavioral variation and covariance between
   activity in an open field test and response to cues of predator presence
   in the house cricket (Acheta domesticus). We provided 98 juvenile
   crickets with either a high or low quality diet during development,
   throughout which we measured body mass, activity in a modified
   open-field, and response to predator excreta twice every week for 3
   weeks. Diet quality affected growth rate but not average activity or
   response to cues of predator presence, nor the correlation between the
   2. However, repeatability (t) in response to cues of predator presence
   was reduced by 0.24 in individuals exposed to the high quality diet
   versus the low quality diet. Larger individuals also increased their
   response to predator cues when reared on a high quality diet, suggesting
   negative feedbacks between growth rate and antipredator behaviors. Our
   results also indicate that changes in the developmental environment are
   not sufficient to collapse behavioral syndromes, suggesting a genetic
   link between activity and predator cue response in house crickets, and
   that nutritional stress early in life can lead to more consistent
   behavioral responses when individuals faced predatory threats. Our
   results demonstrate that subtle differences in the quality of the
   environment experienced early in life can influence how individuals
   negotiate behavioral and life-history trade-offs later in life.}},

Abstract = {{In human psychological research, personality traits as well as cognitive
   traits are usually validated for both, their stability over time and
   contexts. While stability over time gives an estimate on how genetically
   fixated a trait can be, correlations across traits have the power to
   reveal linkages or trade - offs. In animals, these validations have
   widely been done for personality but not for cognitive traits. We tested
   guinea pigs in four consecutive discrimination tasks using four unique
   pairs of objects with two objects of the same form but different size in
   each pair. The same animals were tested twice each for three personality
   traits, i.e. boldness, aggression and sociopositive behaviour. The
   animals did not learn to ``always choose the larger item{''} in the
   cognitive task but learned to discriminate the two objects of each
   stimulus pair anew, so that we did test for learning speed in four
   slightly different task setups. Performance over the four tasks was
   significantly repeatable as well as all tested personality traits. A
   stable linkage over time was found between sociopositive behaviour and
   learning performance, probably indicating an ecological relevance for a
   correlation between these two traits. Still, not all traits seem to be
   connected amongst each other, as in our case boldness and aggression are
   both not linked to individual learning performance. Future studies will
   hopefully further investigate the repeatability of various cognitive
   traits in several species and thus lead to a better understanding of the
   interdependence of personality and cognition. This will help to unravel
   which suites of traits facilitate individual life histories and hence
   improve our understanding of the emergence and maintenance of individual
   differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Failure to participate in a cognitive test may result in sampling biases
   when measuring inter-individual variation in cognitive performances in
   both captive and wild populations. This would be problematic if
   particular classes of individuals consistently fail to participate,
   skewing data and making generalisations or comparisons difficult. We
   presented 144 pheasant chicks, raised under standardised conditions,
   with a battery of cognitive tests to investigate whether sex, body
   condition or personality traits, measured by differences in latencies to
   explore a novel object, novel environment or unknown conspecific,
   predicted individual variation in voluntary participation across 37 test
   sessions. In general, participation increased across testing sessions,
   yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition.
   Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in
   early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or
   females. While participation among males in high body condition was
   consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females,
   regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later,
   rather than earlier sessions. Individuals also showed repeatable
   behaviours across time and different contexts, revealing not only that
   the exploration of novelty, but also that the order that subjects
   entered the testing arena and their latencies to acquire a freely
   available meal-worm reward may be considered valid proxies for different
   personality traits. During each test session, those individuals that
   were among the first to voluntarily enter the testing arena were more
   likely to participate in subsequent trials. Moreover, when isolated in
   the testing arena, individuals that rapidly acquired a freely available
   meal-worm, positioned on the testing apparatus, were also more likely to
   participate in a cognitive test. Our findings therefore reveal that sex,
   body condition and personality traits, along with habituation to the
   testing paradigms, all play important roles in determining whether or
   not particular individuals participate in cognitive tests. Sampling
   biases may therefore misrepresent our understanding of variation in
   cognitive performance in wild and captive populations, making individual
   differences in cognition difficult to interpret. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{43-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Variation in common personality traits, such as boldness or exploration,
   is often associated with risk-reward trade-offs and behavioural
   flexibility. To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of
   consistent behavioural traits on both learning and cognition. We
   investigated whether certain personality traits ('exploration' and
   `sociability') of individuals were related to cognitive performance,
   learning flexibility and learning style in a social ungulate species,
   the goat (Capra hircus). We also investigated whether a preference for
   feature cues rather than impaired learning abilities can explain
   performance variation in a visual discrimination task. We found that
   personality scores were consistent across time and context. Less
   explorative goats performed better in a non-associative cognitive task,
   in which subjects had to follow the trajectory of a hidden object (i.e.
   testing their ability for object permanence). We also found that less
   sociable subjects performed better compared to more sociable goats in a
   visual discrimination task. Good visual learning performance was
   associated with a preference for feature cues, indicating
   personality-dependent learning strategies in goats. Our results suggest

Abstract = {{Several studies report a correlation between exploratory behaviour and
   performance on tests of cognitive ability. Exploration may influence
   learning because less exploratory animals are less likely to come in
   contact with to-be-learned stimuli. Alternatively, the way information
   available in the environment is processed could influence the rate of
   exploration. Pigeons are one of the most-studied species used to examine
   the mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, but have not been used to
   examine the relationship between these abilities and animal personality.
   Here, twelve pigeons were first tested in a novel environment to assess
   repeatability in exploratory behaviour. Pigeons were then trained to
   discriminate between two visual stimuli: lines oriented at 90 degrees
   (vertical, the S+) and 135 degrees (the S-). After training pigeons
   underwent generalization testing with ten additional visual line
   orientation stimuli. We found exploratory behaviour was related to
   generalization performance: fast-explorers had steeper generalization
   gradients compared to slow-explorers. This effect was only seen in the
   direction towards the S-. These results suggest that birds with
   different exploratory styles differ in how they use previously learned
   information. Further testing is needed to confirm which cue(s) (S+ or
   S-) control the behaviour of fast-explorers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   for cognitive stimulation?}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite intense research efforts, biologists are still puzzled by the
   existence of animal personality. While recent studies support a link
   between cognition and personality, the directionality of this
   relationship still needs to be clarified. Early-life experiences can
   affect adult behaviour, and among these, cognitive stimulation has been
   suggested theoretically to influence personality. Yet, the influence of
   early cognitive stimulation has rarely been explored in empirical
   investigations of animal behaviour and personality. We investigated the
   effect of early cognitive stimulation on adult personality in the red
   junglefowl (Gallus gallus). To this end, we assessed adult behaviour
   across a number of personality assays and compared behaviour of
   individuals previously exposed to a series of learning tasks as chicks,
   with that of control individuals lacking this experience. We found that
   individuals exposed to early stimulation were, as adults, more vigilant
   and performed fewer escape attempts in personality assays. Other
   behaviours describing personality traits in the fowl were not affected.
   We conclude that our results support the hypothesis that early
   stimulation can affect aspects of adult behaviour and personality,
   suggesting a hitherto underappreciated causality link between cognition
   and personality. Future research should aim to confirm these findings
   and resolve their underlying dynamics and proximate mechanisms. (C) 2016

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{87-94}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Animals show consistent individual differences in behaviour across time
   and/or contexts. Recently, it has been suggested that proactive
   personality types might also exhibit fast cognitive styles. The speed
   with which individuals sample environmental cues is one way in which
   correlations between personality and cognition might arise. Here, we
   measured a collection of behavioural traits (competitiveness, neophobia,
   neophilia, task-directed motivation and exploration) in common mynas
   (Acridotheres tristis) and measured their relationship with problem
   solving. We predicted that fast solving mynas would interact with (i.e.
   sample) the problem solving task at higher rates, but also be more
   competitive, less neophobic, more neophilic, and more exploratory. Mynas
   that were faster to solve a novel foraging problem were no more
   competitive around food and no more inclined to take risks.
   Unexpectedly, these fast-solving mynas had higher rates of interactions
   with the task, but also displayed lower levels of exploration. It is
   possible that a negative relation between problem solving and spatial
   exploration arose as a consequence of how inter individual variation in
   exploration was quantified. We discuss the need for greater consensus on
   how to measure exploratory behaviour before we can advance our
   understanding of relationships between cognition and personality more
   effectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Food and vitamin D-3 availability affects lizard personalities: an
   experiment}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed recently that labile state variables (e.g. energy
   reserves) can have a key role in the development and maintenance of
   consistent between-individual behavioural variation (i.e. animal
   personality) within population. In male Carpetan rock lizards
   (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland
   secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further,
   vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles.
   Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low)
   and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught
   reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile
   components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the
   degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean
   behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all
   treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x
   vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present
   in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i)
   decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter
   use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased
   risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We
   conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both
   behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I.
   cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural
   consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general.
   Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy
   reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary
   explanations for the reported patterns.
   Significance statement
   The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent
   between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations
   (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been
   recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed
   the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual
   differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether
   short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults
   is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the
   amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality
   and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected
   the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of
   reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards. Therefore, we provide evidence
   that short-term environmental variation does induce or suppress animal
   personality, and it also affects individual behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality has become a major topic in animal behaviour. Much
   recent progress has come from the use of the open-field test, which is
   routinely used to separate individuals into fast and slow explorers.
   However, there is no standard way to conduct the test and it is unclear
   whether the test really measures exploration. Here, we addressed these
   issues by combining an open-field test with a battery of independent
   assays intended to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of
   the behavioural traits suggested to measure exploration in the
   open-field test. Our study subjects were common mynas, Acridotheres
   tristis, introduced to Australia. The analyses confirmed that the
   open-field test allows individuals to be separated according to their
   propensity to explore, mainly through metrics related to spatial and
   object examination of the novel cage. However, other metrics classically
   used to describe exploratory behaviour, such as the latency to enter the
   novel space, reflected shyness rather than exploration. The open-field
   test can therefore be a powerful tool to investigate personality, but
   only if the biological meanings of the metrics derived from the test are
   properly validated with independent behavioural assays. (C) 2016 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{91-100}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although the number of studies documenting animal personalities has
   increased over the last decade, ecological validations of animal
   personality traits remain relatively rare in the behavioural ecology
   literature. I examined whether wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus
   pygerythrus, were consistent in their responses to diverse novel
   objects, and tested whether experimentally assayed boldness predicted
   the number of times individuals were observed inspecting naturally
   occurring snakes at close range. Boldness was repeatable across three
   novel object tests, and boldness scores were correlated with the number
   of snake inspections. An additional novel object, a toy lizard, elicited
   antipredator behaviour and was reclassed as a potential predator
   stimulus; both novel object boldness and the number of snake inspections
   predicted approach of this item. Age-sex class differences in boldness
   and in predator approach and inspection were found to be highly
   consistent across these different contexts. Subadult males were bolder

Abstract = {{Laboratory measures of personality traits are often used to answer both
   evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations
   in the wild within and between populations. However, little is known
   about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with
   behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different
   context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour
   trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the
   activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different
   exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two
   different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test
   and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight
   large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of
   individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration.
   We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in
   activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found
   no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not
   capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or
   activity. We conclude that in our study population, the classic
   exploration behaviour test seems context specific, rather than
   constituting a general exploration strategy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An emerging focus of behavioural ecology is to determine the driving
   forces behind animal personalities. While numerous theories have been
   proposed to explain these behavioural variations, empirical studies on
   this subject remain lacking. Here, we test ecological theory by studying
   the combined effects of physiological condition and habitat quality on
   the behaviour of individual mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, across the
   spawning season (early spawning season and 2 months after). We assessed
   the boldness, energy stores and reproductive effort of crabs collected
   across 10 oyster reefs of low and high quality using laboratory
   observations and subsequent dissections. Crab boldness was significantly
   dependent on the interaction between habitat quality and season. While
   crab behaviour remained relatively constant on healthy reefs, crabs on
   degraded reefs exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in boldness during
   the late spawning season, approximating the boldness of crabs on healthy
   reefs. This behavioural change corresponds to a seasonal shift in crab
   energy store content and is likely to represent a switch in the primary
   driving force of crab behaviour. During the early season, crab boldness
   was positively correlated with short-term stores, whereas later in the
   season, crab boldness was negatively correlated with long-term stores.
   Our results suggest that behaviour is driven by predation pressure and
   refuge availability during the early spawning season, but afterwards
   depends on replenishing energy stores used for reproduction. These
   findings support ecological theory and also provide new insight into the
   stability of behavioural drivers. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{Exploration and sociability in a highly gregarious bird are repeatable

Abstract = {{Personality traits and behavioural syndromes are often assumed to relate
   to life history strategies and lifetime fitness variation and hence may
   be generally under selection. Key in this regard is the, often untested,
   assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are
   maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we
   tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly
   assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of
   sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts
   (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a
   substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless
   of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and
   sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across
   seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability
   estimates over different timescales. However, no evidence was found for
   significant between-individual correlations between the investigated
   traits, including different aspects of sociability. Taken together, our
   results provide empirical evidence that exploration and sociability are
   personality traits that are stable across seasons and in the long term
   but do not form behavioural syndromes. Given the recent evidence that
   personality traits are often heritable, the traits assessed in our study
   might have the potential to evolve independently under selection. This
   long-term consistency in exploration and sociability might have
   important implications for the social organization within complex social
   environments and influence a wide variety of ecologically relevant
   processes. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   profiles in crickets}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{441-450}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aggression between conspecific males is widespread in the animal
   kingdom, as is the fact that some individuals are far more aggressive
   than others. Consistent interindividual differences in behavioural
   profiles are generally regarded as a hallmark for animal `personality'
   in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their proximate causes are
   poorly understood. While the social experiences of winning and losing
   are known to lead to heightened and depressed aggressiveness,
   respectively, and that different fighting experiences can lead to
   changes in other behaviours, the extent to which interindividual
   variation in aggression and correlated behaviours are determined alone
   by fighting experience, environmental factors or inherited
   predisposition is unclear. In this study, we video tracked individual,
   virgin adult male crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, to quantify their
   general motility, exploratory behaviour and attraction to conspecific
   males after 48 h of social isolation, and compared this with their
   performances 24 h later, immediately after a fighting tournament that
   yielded cohorts of aggressive winners and submissive losers. Although
   all known behavioural effects of previous social experience in crickets
   last only a few hours at most, we found significant behavioural
   differences between the 48 h isolated future winners and losers, i.e.
   before the fight tournament. However, the experiences of winning and
   losing led to more pronounced and some additional changes in behaviour.
   We discuss whether these different behavioural profiles associated with
   the chances of winning and losing ('personalities') could arise from
   factors other than fighting experience, or possibly from dominance and
   subjugation experiences gathered under crowded culture conditions before
   social isolation with cumulative effects that may persist longer than
   those presently known. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-93}},

Abstract = {{Sexual conflict over mating rate often implies that males persist at
   frequently harassing females to gain matings while females resist mating
   attempts. In water striders, females can resist by engaging in vigorous
   pre-copulatory struggles to dislodge males, but alternative means of
   resistance have seldom been investigated. Contrary to males, female
   resistance has not been investigated as a repeatable behaviour. We used
   Gerris buenoi to investigate the capacity to abbreviate struggles and
   the tendency to hide off the water as two potential female resistance
   traits. Specifically, we asked whether these behaviours are repeatable
   and whether they vary according to sexual conflict intensity and past
   mating experience. Also, we studied the possible connections between
   these behaviours and traits linked to fitness, namely endured harassment
   and mating activity. The capacity to abbreviate struggles was poorly
   repeatable and decreased with sexual conflict intensity and endured
   harassment. It seems to be mainly determined by the social environment
   and by recent events related to sexual conflict. The tendency to hide
   off the water was significantly repeatable across sexual conflict
   intensities and can be considered as a repeatable behaviour. Hiding
   frequently off the water allowed females to decrease the harassment
   endured by females and may enhance female fitness. In nature, hiding is
   more readily and more frequently observed than pre-copulatory struggles.
   Directly associating hiding off water with female fitness would confirm
   that this consistent phenotype contributes to sexually antagonistic
   female resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Trait-based ecology argues that an understanding of the traits of
   interactors can enhance the predictability of ecological outcomes. We
   examine here whether the multidimensional behavioural-trait diversity of
   communities influences community performance and stability in situ. We
   created experimental communities of web-building spiders, each with an
   identical species composition. Communities contained one individual of
   each of five different species. Prior to establishing these communities
   in the field, we examined three behavioural traits for each individual
   spider. These behavioural measures allowed us to estimate community-wide
   behavioural diversity, as inferred by the multidimensional behavioural
   volume occupied by the entire community. Communities that occupied a
   larger region of behavioural-trait space (i.e. where spiders differed
   more from each other behaviourally) gained more mass and were less
   likely to disband. Thus, there is a community-wide benefit to
   multidimensional behavioural diversity in this system that might
   translate to other multispecies assemblages.}},

Title = {{A Time to Wean? Impact of Weaning Age on Anxiety-Like Behaviour and
   Stability of Behavioural Traits in Full Adulthood}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{In mammals, weaning constitutes an important phase in the progression to
   adulthood. It comprises the termination of suckling and is characterized
   by several changes in the behaviour of both mother and offspring.
   Furthermore, numerous studies in rodents have shown that the time point
   of weaning shapes the behavioural profile of the young. Most of these
   studies, however, have focused on `early weaning', while relatively
   little work has been done to study `late weaning' effects. The aim of
   the present study was therefore to explore behavioural effects of `late
   weaning', and furthermore to gain insights into modulating effects of
   weaning age on the consistency of behavioural expressions over time. In
   total, 25 male and 20 female C57BL/6J mice, weaned after three (W3) or
   four (W4) weeks of age, were subjected to a series of behavioural
   paradigms widely used to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploratory
   locomotion, and nest building performance. Behavioural testing took
   place with the mice reaching an age of 20 weeks and was repeated eight
   weeks later to investigate the stability of behavioural expressions over
   time. At the group level, W4 mice behaved less anxious and more
   explorative than W3 animals in the Open Field and Novel Cage, while
   anxiety-like behaviour on the Elevated Plus Maze was modulated by a
   weaning-age-by-sex interaction. Furthermore, weaning age shaped the
   degree of behavioural stability over time in a sex-specific way. While
   W3 females and W4 males displayed a remarkable degree of behavioural
   stability over time, no such patterns were observed in W3 males and W4
   females. Adding to the existing literature, we could thus confirm that
   effects of weaning age do indeed exist when prolonging this phase, and
   were furthermore able to provide first evidence for the impact of
   weaning age and sex on the consistency of behavioural expressions over
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Dominance hierarchies characterize social groups of various species and
   can significantly influence individual fitness. Personality traits,
   consistent behavioural differences between individuals, have been
   proposed to influence individuals' social status. However, few studies
   so far have investigated the link between personality traits and
   dominance in groups of animals in the wild. Here, we investigated the
   relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked
   to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object
   neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees,
   Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in
   flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that
   if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups,
   dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic
   than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped
   chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of
   linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were
   significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that
   they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that
   proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the
   establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We
   discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual
   attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance
   hierarchies found in nature. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Investigating how environmental factors influence within-species trait
   variability is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance
   of individual behavioural differences (i.e. temperament or personality),
   and their integration into wider ecological theory. Populations of
   Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly
   contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to
   investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits.
   Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel
   environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory
   conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for
   repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between
   populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel
   environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and
   inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable
   behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of
   boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex,
   while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This
   suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently
   according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that
   fish caught from environments without predators and with probable
   intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel
   food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat
   differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes,
   relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable
   insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we
   define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of
   studying temperament within a community ecology context. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Animals typically display among-individual differences in behavior that
   are consistent over time (i.e., personality). These differences are
   often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress
   factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and
   risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are
   considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown
   whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main
   sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested
   whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of
   Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific
   competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic
   and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences
   in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was
   manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile
   individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The
   emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral
   plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior
   among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal
   personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under
   laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors
   that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of
   behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for
   the development of personality in animals.
   Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is,
   individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold
   and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences
   among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often
   caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this
   study, we observed that personality differences were not present at
   juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the
   fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition
   for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences
   strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual
   behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that the decline in
   behavioral plasticity with age may represent a relevant mechanism for
   behavioral differentiation in animals, in agreement with evidences from
   the human literature on age-related loss in behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in personality traits should be
   favoured when those traits contribute to consistent individual fitness
   differences. However, how variations in behaviours are related to
   productivity remains scarcely explored in social species, particularly
   in insects. Here, we investigated whether exploratory, boldness, and
   brood rescue behaviours expressed at the colony-level are associated
   with group productivity that is, colony growth, queen and worker
   production, and larvae survival in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster senilis.
   We found that group-level exploratory activity, boldness, and brood
   rescue efficiency were highly correlated. Furthermore, both exploratory
   activity and brood rescue efficiency were significantly consistent
   across 11 weeks. Finally, differences in brood rescue efficiency
   correlated positively with colony growth, queen and worker production,
   and larvae survival. These results show that colony-level personality
   may be linked with differences in colony life-history strategy, which
   may promote the emergence and maintenance of personality traits in
   group-living species.
   Significance statement
   When groups of individuals show variation in a series of behaviours that
   are related to exploratory activity and parental care, is it related to
   differences in groups' productivity? This is a key question to
   understand the process underlying the evolution and maintenance of
   consistent behavioural differences in a population. Here, we
   investigated whether exploratory, boldness, and brood rescue behaviours
   expressed at the colony-level are associated with group productivity

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{183-195}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although personality has been widely studied among animal species, only
   a few studies have investigated the long-term development of personality
   during early ontogeny. In fact, no study of nonhuman primates has
   consistently mapped personality development from birth to adulthood. Our
   study aimed at closing this gap by examining the development of
   personality among free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, using
   longitudinal behavioural data of 24 subjects (3758 h) collected from
   birth to 7 years of age on the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico,
   U.S.A. In our analyses we combined different frameworks of animal
   personality research to discuss behavioural differences in terms of
   latent personality models, behavioural syndromes and behavioural
   characters. The results showed that a core model of rhesus macaque
   personality, comprising three latent factors (Fearfulness, Aggression,
   Sociability), can already be established over the course of the first 7
   years of life. However, only Fearfulness emerged consistently throughout
   development. While the factor of Sociability diffused during maturation,
   Aggression stabilized towards adulthood after having inconsistent
   loadings during infancy. When assessing correlations among behaviours
   separately on the within- and between-individual level, again only
   Fearfulness showed significant results averaged over the entire study
   period and can therefore be classified as behavioural syndrome or
   behavioural character. We discuss differences in correlations,
   interactions between sex and age and the effect of maternal rank as
   potential source of differences in stability of latent traits.
   Furthermore, we assessed plasticity of behaviour with regard to first
   maternity in females and natal dispersal of males. While the latter was
   accompanied by an increase of fearful behaviour and decrease of physical
   aggression, first maternity was marked by a mixed pattern of changes.
   Overall, our results suggest that rhesus macaques are not born into
   their personality, but grow into it. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Animals generally adjust their behavior in response to bodily state
   (e.g., size and energy reserves) to optimize energy intake in relation
   to mortality risk, weighing predation probability against the risk of
   starvation. Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta
   adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size
   during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is
   important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days,
   respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different
   combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL;
   first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively).
   Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the
   treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \%
   more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large
   within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for
   this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more
   actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration.
   Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being
   more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were
   positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied
   population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish
   two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive
   individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive
   individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct
   behavioral strategies early in life.
   This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in
   animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data
   suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is
   increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a
   limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On
   the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression,
   likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance.
   The experiment was carried out during the main population survival
   bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during
   this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited,
   and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our
   data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters,
   based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are
   positively linked within individuals). Thus, apart from an active and
   aggressive strategy, there seems to be another more passive behavioral
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual
   behavioral variation has become a major focus in behavioral ecology, yet
   we still know remarkably little about how abiotic and biotic factors
   influence personality-dependent fitness trade-offs in naturally
   occurring systems. In particular, fitness trade-offs associated with
   abiotic factors remain underrepresented in the animal personality
   literature. Here, we examine the interacting effects of personality and
   temperature on survival and reproduction-both at the individual and
   colony level-using the socially polymorphic spider Anelosimus studiosus
   as a model system. Overall, temperature had a profound effect on
   survival and reproduction, but the effect differed according to both
   individual personality and the personality composition of colonies.
   Temperature was positively correlated with mortality rates but
   negatively correlated with reproductive rates in aggressive individuals,
   whereas the opposite was true in docile individuals. Colonies composed
   of either all aggressive or all docile individuals suffered reduced
   reproductive rates in high and low temperatures, respectively. In
   contrast, colonies composed of a mixture of aggressive and docile
   individuals performed equally well at both high and low temperatures,
   suggesting that some aspect of colony living helps buffer individuals
   with ill-suited personalities from environmental conditions that would
   otherwise lead to their demise. Our study demonstrates the need to
   consider both abiotic and biotic (i.e., social) context when assessing
   the impact of personality on fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to a growing interest in the ecological implications of
   consistent individual differences in behavior, it is still unclear how
   consistent those differences are across environmental gradients,
   especially under ecologically relevant contexts and timescales. We
   investigated how individual variation in swimming activity of Eurasian
   perch (Perca fluviatilis) changes in response to natural fluctuations of
   water temperature as a proxy for an ecological gradient for ectothermic
   animals. Using an automated acoustic telemetry system, we tracked
   individual positions of adult perch in a whole natural lake for about 1
   year and compared several model frameworks for the individual responses
   to water temperature. The best-fit model revealed that rising water
   temperature led to an increase in both between-and within-individual
   variation in activity, thereby stabilizing behavioral repeatability
   across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation
   significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent
   individual differences in behavior could be partially explained by
   factors such as slowly changing states in the wild. By using
   ecologically relevant data, our results revealed complex patterns of
   behavioral variation in response to an environmental change represented

Abstract = {{Architectural constructions allow animals to modify their environment in
   order to improve their reproductive success. Constructions also modulate
   the expression of individual behavior, ultimately affecting the presence
   and importance of animal personality within populations. The exact
   impact of constructions on personality is seldom investigated. We
   quantified experimentally the impact of web characteristics on
   individual foraging behavior in the Western black widow spider
   (Latrodectus hesperus). We assayed aggressiveness toward a prey cue, and
   boldness while individuals resided on their own web versus after being
   translocated onto webs built by conspecifics. We quantified the
   importance of individual differences in aggressiveness and boldness
   while accounting for differences in web characteristics. We tested for
   relationships between web building, aggressiveness, and boldness. Web
   characteristics affected spider aggressiveness and interacted with
   individual web-building behavior to explain up to a fifth of the
   variation in foraging aggression, but did not affect spider boldness.
   Even after accounting for web characteristics, individuals still
   exhibited important differences in aggressiveness. We detected no
   relationship between an individual's aggressiveness behavioral type and
   the characteristics of the web it built. Surprisingly, web
   characteristics impacted aggressiveness differently from one individual
   to the next. Hence the effect of web characteristics on foraging
   behavior might depend on condition or past experience. Webs contributed
   mostly to the variation in aggressiveness within-individuals. Variation
   in web building behavior might affect the amount of consistent
   differences in foraging, mating, and anti-predator behavior among
   individuals and needs to be accounted for when quantifying individual
   variation in behavior in spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it
   constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality
   could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It
   is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival
   probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among
   individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social
   niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals
   that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social
   conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the
   social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for
   development after a change in social status. In the facultative
   cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis),
   residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this
   forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to
   test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual
   differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an
   individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young
   individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age
   reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers,
   suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's
   social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will
   be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social
   state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social
   state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However,
   novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive
   state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism
   for generating individual differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in the manner that they cope with risk. When these
   behavioral differences are manifested in risky or challenging
   environments (i.e. stressful situations), they are generally interpreted
   within the ``coping style{''} framework. As studying inter-individual
   variability in behavior is particularly challenging in the wild, we used
   a captive facility to explore consistency in the individual behavioral
   response to an acute stress in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Using
   behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a
   calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second,
   explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a
   coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the
   stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of
   phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters
   were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual
   stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was

Title = {{Predicting multifarious behavioural divergence in the wild}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{3-10}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many animals show complex behaviours that can have important ecological
   and evolutionary consequences. Environmental variation can lead to
   divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in
   different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal
   behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions
   remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different
   levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable
   population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components
   of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and
   exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence
   for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish,
   Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled
   caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in
   either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish
   behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between
   predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability
   and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to
   high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex
   dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed
   reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did
   not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a
   behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive
   stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural
   syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar
   predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using
   laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that
   exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant
   within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental
   variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and
   often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that
   various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of
   one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours,
   the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world
   could serve as a valuable conservation tool. (C) 2016 The Association

Title = {{Complex contests and the influence of aggressiveness in pigs}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animal contests vary greatly in behavioural tactics used and intensity
   reached, with some encounters resolved without physical contact while
   others escalate to damaging fighting. However, the reasons for such
   variation remains to be fully explained. Aggressiveness, in terms of a
   personality trait, offers a potentially important source of variation
   that has typically been overlooked. Therefore, we studied how
   aggressiveness as a personality trait influenced escalation between
   contestants matched for resource-holding potential (RHP), using detailed
   observations of the contest behaviour, contest dynamics and escalation
   levels. We predicted that winner and loser behaviour would differ
   depending on personality. This was tested by examining 52 dyadic
   contests between pigs, Sus scrofa. Aggressiveness was assayed in
   resident-intruder tests prior to the contest. Contests were then staged
   between pigs matched for RHP in terms of body weight but differing in
   their aggressiveness. In 27\% of the contests a winner emerged without
   escalated physical fighting, demonstrating that a fight is not a
   prerequisite between RHP-matched contestants. However, the duration of
   contests with or without fighting was the same. In contests without a
   fight, opponents spent more time on mutual investigation and noncontact
   displays such as parallel walking, which suggests that ritualized
   display may facilitate assessment and decision making. Winners low in
   aggressiveness invested more time in opponent investigation and display
   and showed substantially less aggression towards the loser after its
   retreat compared to aggressive winners. Aggressiveness influenced
   contest dynamics but did not predict the level of escalation. Prominent
   behavioural differences were found for the interaction between
   personality and outcome and we therefore recommend including this
   interaction in models where personality is considered. Analyses based on
   contest duration only would miss many of the subtleties shown here and
   we therefore encourage more detailed analyses of animal contests,
   irrespective of the level of contest escalation. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Is there a pace-of-life syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity
   for locomotion in bluegill sunfish?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{175-183}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The concept of behavioural syndromes (i.e. correlations between
   behavioural traits) has provided an important framework for
   understanding individual variation in animal behaviour and its link to
   individual variation in physiology and life-history traits. The
   pace-of-life syndrome concept posits that behavioural, physiological and
   life-history traits coevolve in response to correlated selection
   pressures, and therefore predicts a positive correlation between
   boldness (i.e. exploration and risk taking) and metabolic capacity for
   locomotor performance in individuals. We tested for a pace-of-life
   syndrome linking boldness and metabolic capacity for locomotor activity
   in juvenile bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Individual fish were
   screened and classified as bold or shy using an established refuge
   emergence test. Subsequently, the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms of
   bold and shy individuals were quantified using respirometry and by
   measuring the metabolic by-products of white muscle anaerobic glycolysis
   following exhaustive exercise, respectively. Bold fish demonstrated 25\%
   greater metabolic scope for activity (i.e. aerobic capacity) than shy
   fish, which was attributable to a 15\% greater maximum metabolic rate.
   However, there was no significant difference in resting metabolic rate
   or anaerobic energy expenditure (i.e. anaerobic capacity) between bold
   and shy fish. These results partially support a pace-of-life syndrome
   linking boldness and aerobic metabolism in juvenile bluegill sunfish,
   but did not reveal a link between boldness and anaerobic metabolism. Our
   findings suggest that aerobic and anaerobic capacities may be subject to
   different selection pressures, and that physiological processes
   governing maximum anaerobic performance in fishes are independent from
   behavioural and physiological traits related to boldness. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Boldness, the tendency to be explorative, risk prone and proactive,
   often varies consistently between individuals. An individual's position
   on the boldness-shyness continuum has many implications. Bold
   individuals may outperform shyer conspecifics during foraging as they
   cover more ground, accumulate information more rapidly and make more
   frequent food discoveries. Individual variation in boldness may also
   affect behavioural plasticity across environmental contexts, as the time
   to process new information, the ability to locate and memorise resources
   and the time and ability to apply prior information in a novel context
   all differ between individuals. The primary aim of the current study was
   to examine plasticity in, and covariation between, boldness, foraging
   speed and foraging accuracy across social foraging contexts. We showed
   that the stickleback that were shyest when foraging alone became
   relatively boldest when foraging in a social context and also delayed
   their entry to a known food patch the most in the presence of
   conspecifics. These results support the assertion that shyer foragers
   are more reactive to social cues and add to current knowledge of how an
   individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum may correlate to
   foraging task performance and behavioural plasticity. We conclude that
   the correlation between boldness and behavioural plasticity may have
   broad relevance as the ability to adjust or retain behaviours in
   changing social environments could often have consequences for fitness.
   Animal personality may affect how much individuals change their
   behaviour to suit different environments. We studied the link between
   threespine stickleback personality (boldness or shyness), foraging
   performance and change in foraging performance when either alone or in
   the presence of other stickleback. We found that shyer threespine
   stickleback were more reactive to the presence of other fish when
   foraging. When observed or joined by other fish, shy stickleback started
   exploring earlier, but entered a known food patch later, than when
   alone. Bolder stickleback changed their foraging behaviour much less in
   the presence of other fish. Our results suggest that how bold or shy
   individuals are may have important consequences on how well they adjust
   their foraging behaviour to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how and why consistent behavioural traits (i.e. animal
   personality) vary between individuals, and identifying the mechanisms
   that underlie such variation, is a key focus in behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology. In many animals, male and female behaviour often
   diverges in response to different selection pressures and life history
   trajectories post-maturation. Despite this, animal personality studies
   spanning several personality traits rarely consider both sexes, ignoring
   the very strong possibility that key components of personality,
   behavioural consistency and behavioural correlations, may vary between
   males and females. Furthermore, such variation can play an important
   role in ecological processes such as mediating the invasion propensity
   of a species. Here, we took an animal personality approach to studying
   the behaviour of a repeatedly successful invasive species, the delicate
   skink (Lampropholis delicata). We investigated whether male and female
   delicate skinks differed in their personality across five behavioural
   traits, as sex differences in behaviour could provide a mechanism that
   explains the delicate skink's successful invasion history via accidental
   introductions. We found that females were more social than males and
   showed a trend towards being faster explorers. Both sexes shared the
   same behavioural syndrome suggesting that it is evolutionarily stable
   and not easily decoupled by selection. Specifically, skinks that were
   consistently more active explored environments faster and were more
   likely to bask with other skinks. In sum, we found limited evidence of
   sex-specific personality in the delicate skink suggesting that both
   sexes might have an equal invasion potential. More broadly, our study
   highlights the need to consider whether, in fact, differences in
   personality are important in mediating a species propensity to invade.
   Males and females likely differ in their personality because they often
   face different selection pressures when they are adults. An individual's
   personality may also determine how likely they are to invade novel
   environments. Thus, we compared personality traits of males and females
   in an invasive species, the delicate skink, for what it may reveal about
   the potential mechanisms that drive the species successful invasion
   history. We found that females were more social and showed a trend
   towards being faster explorers than males. Both sexes had positive
   correlations between activity, exploratory and social behaviour
   suggesting the presence of a non-sex-specific behavioural syndrome. Our
   results suggest limited behavioural variation between the sexes and that
   both sexes may have an equal invasion potential.}},

Abstract = {{Among-individual differences in behavior are now a widely studied
   research focus within the field of behavioral ecology. Furthermore,
   elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves,
   and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this,
   we still know little regarding how state may affect the expression of
   behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a
   particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely
   activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organisms to make
   behavioral tradeoffs. In this study, we investigate how recent exposure
   to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the
   mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e.,
   variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer.
   We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral
   expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral
   variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove
   large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of
   repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a
   novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel
   environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham
   injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences.
   Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and
   repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that
   individuals face throughout their lives.
   Animals are known to express consistent among-individual differences in
   behavior, also known as animal personalities, such that some individuals
   are always more bold, aggressive, or active relative to others. Yet it
   is relatively unknown how factors such as energy reserves and exposure
   to pathogens impact these differences in behavior. Here we investigated
   how exposure to a pathogenic bacteria as adults affects both the mean
   behavioral expression and the among-individual differences. Our results
   show that pathogen exposure results in large levels of among-individual
   differences in some aspects of boldness behavior (willingness to expose
   oneself to risk), but not others (latency to become active in a novel
   environment). These results highlight the sensitivity of behavioral
   differences to elements of state, such as infection status.}},

   viability in a spider with mixed social structure}},

Abstract = {{Immigrant viability is a major determinant of the realized rate of gene
   flow across populations. For social organisms, the social context in
   which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have
   important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use
   social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group
   personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength
   of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending
   on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone,
   (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or
   (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of
   individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and
   not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign
   environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were
   transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates
   compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of
   whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as
   individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among
   populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed
   performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with
   resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results
   are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should
   generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social
   species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch
   in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in
   different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual
   personality traits. These results provide a first glimpse into the
   relative roles of individual personality and social context in mediating
   gene flow among populations from divergent environments. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Individuals within animal groups may differ in personality and degree of
   familiarity raising the question of how this influences their social
   interactions. In Iberian magpies Cyanopica cooki, a portion of
   first-year males engage in cooperative behaviours and dispersal,
   allowing addressing this question. In this study, we first investigate
   the relationship between colony familiarity (native versus foreign) and
   reproductive status (breeding versus helping) of males during 21 years.
   Secondly, we measure the exploratory behaviour and monitor reproductive
   status of a sample of individuals with different colony familiarity
   during 2 years. Long-term monitoring revealed that foreign individuals
   were more likely breeders. The analysis on the subset of individuals in
   which exploratory behaviour was measured revealed a mediatory effect of
   exploratory behaviour in the association between colony familiarity and
   helping behaviour. Specifically, among foreign individuals, higher
   explorative males were more frequently involved in helping behaviour
   than lower explorative ones. Conversely, among native males, breeders
   were more explorative than helpers. Our results suggest that aspects of
   personality may mediate the value of familiarity in reproductive tasks
   in social species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Information on where to find food patches, their quality, and food
   variance can have implications for fitness and survival when a current
   food patch fails. Individuals have been found to vary in their response
   to changes in food availability, and this has been related to several
   personality traits in animals such as exploration behavior that measures
   activity in a novel environment. We examined if personality-related
   variation in reactions to food availability change could be explained by
   information-gathering strategies (IGSs), where individuals vary in
   investing in sampling known patches as a trade-off to seeking new
   patches. We also examined if these relationships can be explained by an
   alternative hypothesis where individuals are expected to express
   variation in behavioral flexibility (BF). The BF hypothesis predicted
   that individuals rely more on either internal/prior or external/current
   information. In addition to a standardized exploration behavior test, we
   designed a new 5-day-long experiment where individual reactions to
   changes in food availability were measured using wild great tits Parus
   major). We found that slow exploring individuals sampled empty food
   patches more than fast exploring individuals, supporting the IGS
   hypothesis. We found no evidence for personality-related differences in
   feeder choice in response to changes in food availability, nor
   personality-related differences in flexibility in behavioral responses.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals may vary consistently in their architectural makeup of the
   constructions they build, which might have tremendous implications for
   their ecology and fitness. In particular, the relationship between
   individual differences in architectural constructions and behavior
   (i.e., animal personalities) is largely unexplored. Individual black
   widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, build a 3D cobweb made up of
   distinctive components serving to support foraging (gumfooted lines) or
   antipredator protection (structural lines). To explore the relationship
   between individual differences in behavior and architectural
   constructions, we quantified 1) the level of consistent individual
   variation in several elements of web structure and 2) the level of
   consistent individual variation in foraging behavior and its
   relationship with web structure. We controlled for condition-dependent
   or environmental effects by satiating all spiders prior to assays and
   maintaining them in standardized conditions. Spiders exhibited
   consistent differences in the number of gumfooted lines they built for
   capturing preys and overall web weight, but not in the number of
   structural lines. Individuals also varied consistently in their tendency
   to attack a prey cue, despite all spiders being satiated. Finally,
   spiders producing more gumfooted lines exhibited a higher tendency to
   attack the prey cue. Our results suggest that the architectural
   constructions may impact the expression of individual behavioral
   differences (or animal personalities) and suggest that individual
   behavior and extended phenotype may be part of alternative foraging
   strategies in L. hesperus.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites often manipulate the behavior of their hosts to increase their
   transmission success. However, it is not known whether host manipulation
   affects the consistency of host personality traits or correlations
   between these traits. Here, using fish hosts and their eye-lens
   infecting parasite, we show that manipulative effects of parasites on
   host personalities are weak.Among the ecological factors acting on the
   evolution and expression of animal personalities and behavioral
   syndromes, parasitism has received comparatively little attention.
   However, infection and host behavior are often strongly intertwined,
   because host behavior can predict the risk of infection and can also be
   changed by an infection. We conducted a controlled experimental
   infection study to explore the effects of infection on host boldness,
   exploration and activity using rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and its
   trematode parasite Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, which infects a central
   sensory organ of the fish, the eye lens. Contrary to our expectation,
   infection did not change the within-individual consistency of the
   personality traits or the relationships between the traits, but infected
   individuals were less bold than uninfected control individuals. We also
   found no relationship between personality in uninfected fish and
   resistance against parasite infection, suggesting that behaviors which
   increase parasite encounter do not select for improved resistance. Thus,
   we found only weak support for parasite-mediated effects on animal
   personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Corvids (Family: CORVIDAE) are a clade of some 120 species widespread
   throughout much of the world that have attracted the interest of
   researchers due to their impressive cognitive abilities. The group is,
   however, also generally described as neophobic, a trait that increases
   the difficulty of undertaking such research. In Australia, Torresian
   crows (Corvus orru) have, like corvid species worldwide, thrived in
   urban environments, sharing this habitat with a number of other corvoid
   (Superfamily: CORVOIDEA) species. While each of these species has
   successfully colonised urban areas, the extent to which neophobia is
   present is not known. This study empirically tested the extent to which
   neophobia is exhibited in wild urban Torresian crows by measuring the
   delaying effect of a novel object to obtaining food and any changes in
   neophobic behaviours displayed. This was then compared with the other
   urban corvoid species that inhabit similar niches. This study confirmed
   that Torresian crows are significantly wary of a novel objects,
   displaying more neophobic behaviours and taking longer to attain the
   food. Crow behaviour provided evidence in support of both the dangerous
   niche hypothesis and the two-factor model of neophobia and neophilia.
   Crows also displayed these behaviours to a significantly greater extent
   than the three other corvoids studied. However, the individual variation
   in crow behaviours when exposed to a novel object was extensive. This
   variation may be attributed to differing behavioural types between
   individuals, or different experiences with novel objects or humans in
   the bird's past.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that interindividual differences in the activity of brown
   trout alter the exposure to parasitic freshwater pearl mussel glochidia
   was tested in a Swedish stream. Wild yearling brown trout (N=103) were
   caught, individually tagged for identification and scored for open-field
   activity during standardized laboratory tests in June. Fifty gravid
   freshwater pearl mussels were relocated to the stream, where after the
   trout were released back into the stream. The fish were recaptured in
   October (N=35), checked for glochidia encystment (infested individuals:
   n=6) and re-scored for open-field activity traits. Swimming velocity
   during the test was higher in fish infected with glochidia, suggesting
   that high activity could increase their exposure to glochidia.
   Potentially, as metabolism rate and ventilation rate typically increase
   with activity, elevated activity may lead to an increased likelihood of
   glochidia passing over the gills. This novel finding suggests that
   glochidia infestation is non-random and that the behaviour of the host
   fish can influence the likelihood of glochidia infestation.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species vary consistently in their behaviour
   across time and context, and this is often referred to as animal
   personality. In this study, we investigate animal personality based on
   the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional
   factors, which are linked to biological internal factors that are stable
   and perhaps heritable. Although not directly measurable, these
   underlying dispositional factors predispose individuals to react through
   different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness
   continuum reflected in the consistency across time of the
   inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards two
   different novelty tests: a novel object test representing non-social
   contexts and a mirror test representing social contexts. Our study
   animals were 60 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised
   in identical housing conditions. We recorded the approach behaviour of
   the mink towards novelty at two different times: the first time during
   non-breeding season in December 2013 and the second time during
   pre-breeding season in February 2014. Behavioural variables were
   analysed using principal component analyses and our results show
   consistency in inter individual variation in shyness measures across
   seasons. This consistency differed across non-social and social contexts
   forming two different shyness-boldness dimensions as were also found
   across context in a previous study. To our knowledge this is the first
   study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum across time
   and season in the American mink from non-breeding season in December to
   pre-breeding season in February. Our study confirms the existence of
   personality in farmed American mink, but interestingly, we saw a shift
   in the positioning of most individuals from shy to more bold on the
   shyness continuum when comparing the December measures to the February
   measures. This shift was further supported by the results of a simple
   stick test, which indicated a change towards a higher responsiveness
   towards humans in the pre-breeding season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality has been linked to individual fitness across many
   taxa. However, the exact path by which personality translates into
   fitness is rarely identified. We tested whether nest site choice may
   serve as a potential pathway linking personality and reproductive
   success in a natural population of chestnut thrush, Turdus rubrocanus.
   Using path analysis, we found that human disturbance and choice of nest
   site with respect to nest density may both mediate the link between
   personality and reproductive success. Bolder females may choose nest
   sites with lower nest density, and the low nest density in turn may be
   responsible for a positive effect on nestling number, and have a
   negative effect on nestling mass. Bolder females may also prefer nest
   sites further from human settlements, resulting in a negative effect on
   nestling mass. Our findings provide rare exact mechanistic pathways by
   which boldness might be translated into reproductive success. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Personality in free-living individuals has predominantly been measured
   under standardized laboratory conditions. Such measurements have been
   then linked to life-history traits, fitness and survival. Yet, it
   remains unclear how such personality measurements reflect the variation
   shown by free-living individuals, if the same measurements were taken
   directly in their natural environment. Here, we used free-living African
   striped mice to test whether the personality traits of activity,
   boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when measured in the
   laboratory and in the field contexts. First, we established whether
   personality traits were repeatable and consistent within one context.
   Next, we compared measurements across the two different contexts.
   Additionally, we established whether personality traits were correlated
   with one another in behavioural syndromes and assessed whether the
   resulting syndromes were consistent across the two contexts. All
   personality traits in the laboratory were measured using classical
   personality tests. The same tests were then modified and used to measure
   personality of the same individuals in the field. All personality traits
   were highly repeatable and consistent within the same context. In
   addition, individuals behaved consistently for all the behaviours
   measured both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we found that
   the presence of two correlated context-specific separate latent
   variables (one for the field and one for the laboratory) underpinned all
   the behaviours measured, indicating that there is a context-specific
   syndrome in this species. Overall, our results confirm that measurements
   of personality traits of wild striped mouse individuals recorded in the
   laboratory environment are consistent with the traits that the same
   individuals show under natural conditions.
   Animal personality research has been mostly focused on measuring traits
   of wild individuals under standardized laboratory conditions. Most
   recently, however, such approaches have come under increased scrutiny as
   it is unclear whether personality measured in the laboratory reflects
   the variation that the same individuals would show if the same
   measurements were taken directly in their natural habitat. Here, we used
   wild African striped mice to test whether the personality traits of
   activity, boldness, exploration and aggression are consistent when
   measured in the laboratory and in the field contexts. Using similar
   protocols, we established whether personality traits were repeatable and
   consistent within one context and then compared measurements across the
   two different contexts. We showed that personality measures from
   standardized laboratory conditions are consistent with field
   measurements for all personality traits considered.}},

Abstract = {{In animal contests, individuals respond plastically to the phenotypes of
   the opponents that they confront. These ``opponent{''}aEuro{''}or
   ``indirect{''}aEuro{''}effects are often repeatable, for example,
   certain opponents consistently elicit more or less aggressiveness in
   others. ``Personality{''} (repeatable among-individual variation in
   behavior) has been proposed as an important source of indirect effects.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male
   field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring
   aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in
   nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask
   whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity,
   exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a
   behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing
   direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects.
   Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes
   indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology
   and evolution of behavior.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary change in one trait can elicit evolutionary changes in
   other traits due to genetic correlations. This constrains the
   independent evolution of traits and can lead to unpredicted ecological
   and evolutionary outcomes. Animals might frequently exhibit genetic
   associations among behavioural and morphological-physiological traits,
   because the physiological mechanisms behind animal personality can have
   broad multitrait effects and because many selective agents influence the
   evolution of multiple types of traits. However, we currently know little
   about genetic correlations between animal personalities and
   nonbehavioural traits. We tested for associations between personality,
   morphology and locomotor performance by comparing zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) collected from the wild and then selectively bred for either a
   proactive or reactive stress coping style ('bold' or `shy' phenotypes).
   Based on adaptive hypotheses of correlational selection in the wild, we
   predicted that artificial selection for boldness would produce
   correlated evolutionary responses of larger caudal regions and higher
   fast-start escape performance (and the opposite for shyness). After four
   to seven generations, morphology and locomotor performance differed
   between personality lines: bold zebrafish exhibited a larger caudal
   region and higher fast-start performance than fish in the shy line,
   matching predictions. Individual-level phenotypic correlations suggested
   that pleiotropy or physical gene linkage likely explained the correlated
   response of locomotor performance, while the correlated response of body
   shape may have reflected linkage disequilibrium, which is breaking down
   each generation in the laboratory. Our results indicate that evolution
   of personality can result in concomitant changes in morphology and
   whole-organism performance, and vice versa. (C) 2016 The Association for

Abstract = {{Biological variability is no longer considered as statistical noise, but
   rather as an adaptive benefit. This variability comes from consistent
   differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals
   to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{''},
   ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how
   to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency
   over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about
   the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because
   contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to
   the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in
   personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely
   to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as
   important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was
   to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability)
   impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis,
   one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared
   juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for
   feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days.
   Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable
   versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass
   reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer
   than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they
   took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/-
   34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was
   similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing
   a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before
   and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance
   of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness.
   In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time
   should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as
   growth and behavior. Although personality traits are partially
   heritable, this study demonstrates the important influence of
   environmental conditions and life history on behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The existence of personalities has been explored in various
   invertebrates, but a comprehensive investigation of personality
   differences across individuals in a eusocial insect has not yet been
   conducted. The study of personality differences across individuals
   within the same behavioral caste may contribute to an understanding of
   how social insects divide labor within the nest. Here, we define and
   investigate three dimensions of personality within the worker caste of a
   model social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, as follows: (1)
   consistent individual behavioral differences over time, (2) consistent
   individual behavioral differences across contexts, and (3) the presence
   of correlated suites of behaviors. To test whether honey bee workers
   exhibit dimensions 1 and 2, we repeatedly assessed responses of groups
   of same-age bees in cages to stimuli that are relevant to bee life
   history. To test for dimension 3, we examined behavior within a colony
   context by using observation hives to record the behaviors of individual
   bees across their lifetimes. Our results provide some evidence for all
   three dimensions of personality in honey bee workers. In particular, our
   data suggest some individuals may be more likely to be highly
   interactive with other workers (e.g., engaging in food sharing), while
   other individuals are consistently less interactive. These findings
   expand upon and contribute to previous models for the organization of
   worker division of labor in honey bees, suggesting that consistent
   behavioral differences (personalities) of workers within a behavioral
   caste have the potential to contribute to subcaste division of labor.
   Significance statement
   Behavioral ecologists have become increasingly interested in animal
   personalities, individual behavioral differences that are consistent
   over time and in different contexts, with recent focus on understanding
   the occurrence of personalities across taxa and their adaptive value.
   The existence and function of personality differences among individuals
   in complex societies, such as eusocial insects, remain understudied.
   Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of whether
   workers of the highly eusocial honey bee show hallmarks of personality.
   Although these workers demonstrate well-documented behavioral changes as
   they age, we uncovered some aspects of their behavior, in particular,
   their tendency to physically interact with other bees, remain somewhat
   consistent even as they age and change roles within the colony. We
   suggest that individual-level personality differences have the potential
   to contribute to colony division of labor by creating variation in
   individual tendencies to perform different tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Personality differences are widespread throughout the animal kingdom and
   can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite a
   rapidly increasing body of literature, large (marine) vertebrates remain
   underrepresented in personality research. Given their unique life
   history traits (e.g. slow growth rate, slow reproduction rate, long life
   span) and their pivotal role in ecosystem processes, this is an
   important gap in our current knowledge. Here we investigated consistency
   and plasticity in movement behaviour of wild juvenile lemon sharks,
   Negaprion brevirostris, by repeatedly subjecting sharks to open field
   tests. First, we investigated the presence of interindividual
   differences in movement behaviour in a novel open field. Second, we
   investigated the effect of trial repetition on movement behaviour to
   understand whether movement in a novel open field reflects a reaction to
   novelty, or general activity. Third, we estimated individual differences
   in habituation/sensitization rates over trial repetition and studied how
   the habituation rate was predicted by the initial movement rate. We
   found consistent individual differences in movement behaviour during the
   open field tests. Sharks showed habituation in movement behaviour (i.e.
   decrease) over repeated trials indicating that the movement behaviour
   during the first trials is a reaction to novelty, and not general
   activity. Individuals, however, differed in their rate of habituation
   (i.e. plasticity) and this rate was negatively related to an
   individual's movement behaviour in the first open field trial. In
   addition to showing individual differences in consistency and plasticity
   in juvenile lemon sharks, our study emphasizes the importance of
   examining the validity of personality tests when adapting them to new
   species. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{An animal's personality may be an adaptive behavioral response of
   individuals to consistent differences in physiology and life-history.
   Studying the relationship between behavior and other fitness-related
   traits within the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) framework, which explains
   the integration of different traits using the concept of a fast-slow
   life-history continuum, may thus be a useful approach to understanding
   the evolution and maintenance of animal personality. According to the
   POLS hypothesis, for example, fast individuals should be behaviorally
   more active, bolder or less sociable, and potentially invest more in
   reproduction than slow individuals. Here, we examined whether the
   sociability of juvenile sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is linked
   with their key reproductive traits, carotenoid-based nuptial coloration
   of males and egg production of females. We also tested whether
   experimental manipulation of environmental conditions (control vs. warm
   winter) can change pace-of-life and the link between behavioral and
   reproductive traits. Male sticklebacks prone to shoaling expressed lower
   peak red coloration at the reproductive stage, during which they were
   solitary and territorial. In females, fecundity was not correlated with
   early social behavior. Experimental sticklebacks reared in warm winter
   conditions decreased their investment in reproduction, but the negative
   relationship between sociability and sexual signal of males was
   maintained. Our results suggest that the POLS could partly explain the
   maintenance of personality under predation pressure or severe mating
   competition. In natural environments, any benefit to sociable male
   sticklebacks may be counterbalanced by the cost of growing less
   attractive.
   Why do animals vary in personality, and how is such variation maintained
   within a population? An interesting approach for understanding this is
   studying how personality traits are correlated with other
   fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life framework. For the first
   time, our results show the link between sociability at the juvenile
   stage and the expression of sexual ornament during reproduction in male
   three-spined sticklebacks. Sociable juveniles may benefit from reduced
   predation risk, but they grow less attractive and this may reduce their
   mating success during reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between survival
   and reproduction may contribute to the maintenance of among-individual
   variation in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative mating behaviour, personality traits and morphological
   characters are predicted to be correlated. Bolder, larger and more
   colourful males are expected to preferentially court females, while shy,
   small and drab-coloured individuals are predicted to sneak copulations.
   We used males of Endler's guppy, Poecilia wingei, to test this
   association over a long temporal period (hence including ontogenetic
   changes) and under two social environments (male-biased and
   female-biased). We found that personality traits (exploration, boldness,
   activity) of P.wingei males were highly repeatable across long time
   spans, but they were not correlated (formed no behavioural syndrome).
   Male age and social environment had no effect on any personality trait,
   despite their effects on alternative mating behaviour. Young males with
   higher activity levels were more likely to attempt sneaking. In older
   fish, there was an association between orange coloration, courtship and
   boldness, but this was not observed in young males. Our results suggest
   that alternative mating behaviour is more flexible than personality
   traits and is independent of them. Non-colour-based morphological traits
   (gonopodium length, body length, caudal straps length, dorsal fin
   length) were not correlated with any particular mating behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Predators can affect prey both directly (consumptive effects) and
   indirectly (nonconsumptive effects), with a growing body of literature
   showing the latter may have pronounced effects. Prey populations are
   comprised of individuals that differ in perception of and willingness to
   take risk; therefore, studying how different types of individuals
   respond to predation risk is necessary to fully understand prey
   dynamics. Playbacks were used to experimentally manipulate perceived
   predation risk in nest-box populations of wild great tits (Parus major)
   to examine the nonconsumptive effects of avian predators on prey
   behavior and morphology, and to explore individual differences in prey
   response. Individuals responded to our treatment, and responses differed
   depending on both treatment and pre-manipulation behavioral type. Birds
   in areas exposed to predator playback tended to decrease in body mass
   more than birds exposed to nonthreatening (control) playback.
   Differences between treatment groups were mainly driven by initially
   fast exploring birds: In the control treatment, fast explorers increased
   in mass, whereas the initially fast exploring birds in the predation
   treatment decreased in mass. Furthermore, birds exposed to predator
   playback decreased exploratory tendency compared with controls. These
   findings demonstrate that predation risk alters great tit behavior
   (exploration) and morphology (body mass) and that plasticity in response
   to risk relates to an individual's willingness to take risks. Our
   findings suggest that individuals differ in susceptibility to predation
   risk, causing adaptive individual differences in responsiveness to
   changes in predation risk. Acknowledging individuality in responses to
   perceived predation risk has important consequences for understanding

Abstract = {{Expression of sexually selected signals in many species varies over time
   of day and season. A key model system to study this variation in signal
   expression is birdsong. Yet, despite good ecological understanding of
   why song varies across time of day and season, much of the individual
   variation remains unexplained. Although some of the interindividual
   variation in singing depends on the quality or motivation of an
   individual, it can also vary with other characteristics. Because singing
   has been shown to vary with personality traits in specific contexts,
   personality is thus an important candidate to explain part of the
   variation in seasonal and daily singing. Using a personality-typed field
   population of great tits (Parus major), we here show that singing
   activity peaked at dawn during the fertile period of the females and
   that the association between male personality and singing activity
   depended on the reproductive stage of his mate; faster explorers
   significantly increased in singing activity during main periods of
   fertility and maternal investment (egg laying and incubation). Moreover,
   males with higher singing activity tended to raise more fledglings.
   Increased singing by faster explorers during key periods of female
   reproductive investment suggests that faster explorers are more
   responsive to changes in female reproductive stage, contrasting the
   general view that faster explorers are less responsive to environmental
   and social changes. Most importantly, these findings highlight that
   multiple factors including personality need to be integrated when
   assessing causes of variation of highly variable sexually selected
   signal traits.}},

Abstract = {{Animals adjust their behaviour over time and contexts to cope with
   ecological and environmental variation. However, the presence of
   consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e.
   personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible
   than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the
   experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect
   estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and
   risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki,
   a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk
   taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a
   standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied
   linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter
   mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity
   increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks
   was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on
   average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We
   highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal
   variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with
   escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small
   environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank
   size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking
   and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality
   estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank
   orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that
   behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that
   personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to
   variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The ways in which animal societies respond to threat has enormous
   consequences for their success. In the present study, we investigated
   how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus
   dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how
   their responses change with experience with important predators,
   Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a
   mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much
   defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony
   defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience
   with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic
   composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals
   were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus,
   colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to
   experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally
   observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to
   determine which individual traits were associated with task
   participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology
   and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level,
   with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the
   attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making.
   Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting
   participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between
   colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence
   that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in
   situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively
   associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to
   different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether
   these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare.
   Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive
   success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the
   exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests
   and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour
   (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness
   were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal
   component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the
   females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in
   two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014
   we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our
   results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected
   by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which
   may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female
   reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was
   only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at
   the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was
   additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food
   availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and
   explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We
   conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of
   the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive
   impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food
   availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of
   personality on reproductive success differed between changing
   environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that
   different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by
   varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Consistent inter-individual behavioral differences in animals, or animal
   personalities, are increasingly recognized as an important component of
   sexual selection. Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated
   effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the
   link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in
   species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the
   non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality
   traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated
   effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model
   species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using
   competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability
   to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting
   sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female
   choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus
   independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals
   better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning
   decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male
   competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent
   between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males
   with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits
   of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition
   in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas
   female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of
   male personality.
   Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species
   with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish
   where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until
   hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits
   promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted
   nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality
   had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating
   preferences. Instead, females agreed remarkably well in their mating
   decisions and consistently favored large males with elaborate nests. Our
   results show that male personality is important for nest allocation,
   which is crucial in environments where nesting sites are rare.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a growing body of literature reporting developmental changes in
   personality, few studies have adopted a lifetime perspective to study
   age-related changes in personality traits. Since most personality traits
   are heritable and linked with fitness, ontogenetic changes can have
   evolutionary implications. In this paper, we explore age-related changes
   in two behavioral responses to handling, both of which are heritable and
   associated with fitness, in wild blue tits. We find that one of these
   responses (handling aggression), which is positively correlated with
   fitness, declines with age. We show that this age-related decline is not
   due to selective disappearance, but occurs also within individuals,
   which confirms that this personality trait undergoes a senescent decline
   in the wild. We further find that individuals differ significantly in
   their rate of ageing but found no statistical support for the presence
   of genotype-age interactions on personality. Future research on
   personality would benefit from a more explicit lifetime perspective.
   Our study constitutes the first demonstration of a senescent decline in
   a personality trait and underlines the need for future research on
   personality to adopt a more explicit lifetime perspective. In addition,
   we provide an example of how to investigate age-related plasticity in
   behavior while dealing with typical issues arising from the use of
   longitudinal data, which will be of interest for behavioral ecologists.
   Finally, our approach is likely to stimulate research given its
   relevance for both our proximate and ultimate understanding of animal
   personality in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral repeatability is an important trait relevant to personality
   research and to behavioral ecology in general. We examined here the
   behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and
   edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge).
   We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine
   whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and
   whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than
   larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral
   repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae
   and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These
   findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably
   reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during
   metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral
   repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young
   adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained
   similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on
   repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two
   pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for
   the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual
   differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a
   shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was
   also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable
   than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may
   be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies.
   We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in
   insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual
   behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage,
   and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question
   has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full
   metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an
   opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous
   results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial
   metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important,
   because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This
   is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on
   differences between males and females, probably indicating on
   differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging.
   Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been
   already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural and physiological responses to
   challenges are progressively accepted as adaptive variation and reveal a
   strong degree of evolutionary conservation throughout the vertebrate
   taxa. Previous studies in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) suggested
   that individual differences in behaviour reflect distinct coping styles
   or personality, contrasting consistent traits associations. One of the
   traits that have been shown to be consistent over time and across
   context is the escape response under a restraining test. Using this
   trait as a proxy of personality in seabream the influence of social
   context in the consistency of escape behaviour was investigated.
   Individually tagged juvenile seabream (n = 360; 70.18 +/- 11.44 g; mean
   +/- SD) were subjected to a restraining test that consisted of keeping
   each fish in an emerged net for one minute. Behaviours measured in the
   net (latency to escape; number of escape attempts and total time spent
   on escaping) were collapsed into first principal component scores using
   Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Using the PCA scores the
   individuals were distributed into homogeneous groups (n = 30 each group)
   of proactive, reactive and intermediate. Control groups consisted of
   mixed groups with 1/3 of each coping style. After one month the same
   individuals were exposed to the same test (restraining test) to assess
   consistency of behavioural responses. Results indicate that homogenous
   groups of proactive (p = 0.086) and reactive (p = 0.159) individuals did
   not exhibit consistent behavioural responses as opposed to the
   intermediate (p = 0.028) and control groups (p < 0.001). This study thus
   confirms that the social context in which fish are kept significantly
   influence personality traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Identifying evolutionary and developmental mechanisms underlying
   consistent between-individual differences in behaviour is the main goal
   in `animal personality studies'. Here, we explored whether activity and
   risk-taking varied consistently between individuals and correlated to
   various potentially fitness linked - male traits in Carpetan rock
   lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni). Lizards showed significant consistency
   within both behaviours, implying the presence of activity and
   risk-taking personalities. However, there were no correlation between
   activity and risk-taking, neither on the between-nor on the
   within-individual levels, implying the absence of a behavioural
   syndrome. We found a strong link between the intensity of blood parasite
   (Haemogregarinidae) infection and risk-taking: lizards with higher
   infection intensity took more risk. While we cannot distinguish cause
   from causative in the parasite intensity - risk-taking correlation our
   results are in line with the asset protection hypothesis predicting that
   individuals with lower future reproductive value should focus on the
   current reproductive event and take higher risk.}},

Abstract = {{Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are
   inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease
   ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective
   fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the
   behaviour disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects
   parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between
   the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites
   are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on
   parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is
   essential for understanding the complex connections between animal
   behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point,
   we discuss how host behaviour parasite feedbacks might operate and
   explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and
   parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure
   on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about
   parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites
   and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the
   maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the
   feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather
   than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between
   mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour
   parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding
   of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are
   maintained.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Abstract = {{Besides being recognized as a potential welfare indicator, play
   behaviour has long been considered to have immediate and/or long-term
   benefits. In particular, it has been suggested that in play animals
   learn to cope physically and emotionally with unexpected events. Given
   that the propensity to play varies greatly between conspecific
   individuals, such interindividual variability in playfulness may be
   associated with differences in the animals' future behaviour, a
   prediction that has rarely been tested. To investigate whether different
   levels of playfulness in juvenility indeed coincide with behavioural
   differences in later life, 30 female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the
   following series of behavioural observations and tests: (1)
   quantification of juvenile play behaviour; (2) behavioural testing in
   paradigms that assess anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion
   in an unfamiliar environment; and (3) observation of spontaneous
   behaviour in the familiar home cage environment. Surprisingly, a high
   level of juvenile playfulness was predictive of high levels of state
   anxiety and low levels of exploratory locomotion in later life. While
   this relationship existed already in adolescence, it became even more
   prominent in adulthood. By contrast, no substantial differences between
   playful and less playful mice were found with respect to home cage
   behaviour. While these findings may reflect better coping abilities in
   novel and dangerous environments in those mice that played the most
   during juvenility, they may also argue for the existence of different
   types of mice. Thus, despite genetic homogeneity and identical housing
   environments, preferences for either local or global use of space were
   observed that indicate the emergence of individuality. Concerning animal
   welfare, our findings suggest that play may constitute a plausible
   welfare indicator at the population level, but is probably less
   meaningful for the individual. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Spatial location within aggregations (i.e., periphery, central) is of
   biological significance to gregarious animals. Because these positions
   are a potential consequence of consistent individual behavioral
   differences, or personality, a better understanding of potential
   mechanisms concerning personality is central to predicting an
   individuals' location. To determine the effects of individual
   personality on the dynamic spatial positioning of Uca pugilator while
   herding, field data collection and agent-based modeling were employed.
   Individuals were assayed to establish their personalities and returned
   to the field for observation as a means of identifying location
   preference within selfish herds. There was a significant difference
   between the extreme personalities and the proportion of time spent on
   the edge of the herd. The active individuals were at the periphery
   similar to 50 \% more of the time than less active individuals. An
   individual-based model qualitatively replicated these field results by
   applying the mechanism of activity level as an indicator of individual
   personality. This suggests that differences in personality-dependent
   movement are sufficient to explain the spatial positioning of
   individuals within selfish herds. This study enhances our understanding
   of the possible mechanisms that govern group movement, and has
   implications for modeling population dynamics that can be influenced by
   individual personality.
   Animal personality influences the level of exploratory activity of
   individual animals, with some individuals being consistently more active
   and others consistently less active, and may therefore be used to
   mechanistically predict the location of individual animals within groups
   or herds. Here, we investigate the relationship between individual
   personality and location on the edge vs. in the center of foraging herds
   of the sand fiddler crab Uca pugilator. We combine observational testing
   of activity level in lab, observations of spatial positioning within
   herds in the field, and agent-based computer simulation modeling to
   demonstrate that differences in exploratory movement can sufficiently
   explain the spatial positioning of individuals within herds. Thus, the
   spatial positioning of individual animals within herds can be explained
   without relying on choices by individual animals.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{553-559}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation in behavior has largely been neglected by
   community ecologists to date. Recently, however, a number of studies
   demonstrated that intraspecific variation can have profound consequences
   for species interactions and thereby alter community dynamics in
   solitary organisms. Here, we study how intraspecific variation in
   collective behaviors (also called ``collective personalities{''})
   affects the outcome of resource contests between 2 co-occurring species
   of ants, Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. Our results
   revealed that intraspecific variation in colonies' exploration behavior
   and aggressiveness predicts the outcome of interspecific contests for
   food and nest sites. How exploratory behavior affected the outcome of
   the foraging and nest site contests depended on the species: exploratory
   behavior seemed to enhance performance in foraging contests in T.
   curvispinosus but diminish it in T. longispinosus. More interestingly,
   whether a species was successful in nest site contests depended not only
   on its collective personality but also on the personality of its
   opponent colony. Temnothorax longispinosus experienced greater success
   if its opponent colony had similar exploratory tendencies to its own. In
   contrast, T. curvispinosus performed best when its opponent colony
   exhibited a contrasting exploratory tendency to its own. Our data
   demonstrate that intraspecific variation in colony behavior can have
   consequences for contest outcomes and ensure that no one species or
   behavioral strategy consistently experiences superior success. This, in
   turn, might help to maintain variation in collective behavior in
   multiple interacting populations and prevent competitive exclusion of
   one of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem integrity are under threat from
   biological invasions. The ``killer shrimp{''} Dikerogammarus villosus is
   a highly predatory amphipod that has spread readily across Central
   Europe and recently the UK and its arrival has been associated with the
   significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its
   behavioral ecology are sparse, even though its behavior may contribute
   to its invasion success. For the first time, we investigated
   antipredator ``fleeing{''} behavior in D. villosus and how this changed
   with water temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis.
   First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but
   consistent among-individual differences in behavior. These are driven by
   a combination of mean level among-individual differences and
   within-individual relative consistency in behavior, and provide the key
   marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were not
   influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all
   individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus,
   indicating a capacity for individual learning. We suggest that the
   antipredator behavior of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and
   that consistent among-individual differences in behavior may promote
   biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to
   changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous,
   particularly in an era of global climate change, where average
   temperatures could be elevated and less predictable.}},

Title = {{Variation in behavioural plasticity regulates consistent individual
   differences in Enallagma damselfly larvae}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Plastic behavioural responses by individuals to different conditions and
   consistent individual differences in mean behaviour across situations
   both contribute to variation in a population. The relationship between
   behavioural plasticity and consistent individual differences is not
   clearly understood but may help predict personality variation in
   animals. High variation in mean behaviour and low variation in
   individual plastic responses will tend to maintain the rank order of
   individuals across situations and so permit consistent individual
   differences. Conversely, low variation in mean behaviour and high
   variation in plastic responses, by changing the rank orders of
   individuals, will erode consistent individual differences. Thus,
   selection that reduces variation in individual plastic responses should
   increase the opportunity for consistent individual differences in a
   population. We tested for relationships between heterogeneous predation
   regimes, the mean and variance of behavioural plasticity and consistent
   individual differences among three species groups of larval damselflies.
   Larvae of Enallagma signatum probably face consistent predation from
   fish over successive generations, whereas Enallagma ebrium/hageni and
   Enallagma annexum/boreale face a changing predation regime over
   generations either from fish or larval dragonflies. The behavioural
   reaction norms of larvae in repeated exposure trials to cues from a
   predatory fish, dragonfly larvae or no predator differed between species
   groups. Enallagma ebrium/hageni expressed the most consistent plastic
   response to predator cues, less variability in plasticity and greater
   consistent individual differences across cues compared to more variable
   plastic responses and low consistent individual differences in E.
   signatum. Selection on behavioural plasticity may enhance consistent
   individual differences in E. ebrium/hageni whereas relaxing selection on
   plasticity may reduce consistent individual differences in E. signatum.
   More generally, selection on plastic behaviour may enhance behavioural
   types while selection on mean behaviour may reduce behavioural types in
   animal populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

   sticklebacks}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom and have
   been shown both to influence individual behaviour in the social context
   and to be affected by it. However, little attention has been paid to
   possible carryover effects of social conditions on personality
   expression, especially when individuals are alone. Here we investigated
   how the recent social context affected the boldness and repeatability of
   three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, during individual
   assays. We housed fish either solitarily, solitarily part of the time or
   socially in groups of four, and subjected them twice to a risk-taking
   task. The social conditions had a large effect on boldness
   repeatability, with fish housed solitarily before the trials showing
   much higher behavioural repeatability than fish housed socially, for
   which repeatability was not significant. Social conditions also had a
   temporal effect on the boldness of the fish, with only fish housed
   solitarily taking more risks during the first than the second trial.
   These results show that recent social conditions can thus affect the
   short-term repeatability of behaviour and obfuscate the expression of
   personality even in later contexts when individuals are alone. This
   finding highlights the need to consider social housing conditions when
   designing personality studies and emphasizes the important link between
   animal personality and the social context by showing the potential role
   of social carryover effects. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf

Abstract = {{I experimentally tested the repeatability and plasticity of two

   juvenile three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. I quantified

   changes over time in two groups of sticklebacks that were either exposed
   or not exposed to simulated predation pressure. Shoaling and risk taking
   were repeatable within individuals in both experimental and control
   fish. Individual willingness to shoal increased over time in both
   experimental and control groups, but there was no evidence that shoaling
   changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal
   changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became
   increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this
   behaviour is plastic. There was, however, no evidence of
   between-individual variation in the behavioural changes over time in
   either the control or experimental condition, suggesting that
   behavioural plasticity is a fixed response in the individuals of this

Title = {{Do reproduction and parenting influence personality traits? Insights
   from threespine stickleback}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{247-254}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although one of the hallmarks of personality traits is their consistency
   over time, we might expect personality traits to change during life
   history shifts. Becoming a parent is a major life history event, when
   individuals undergo dramatic behavioural and physiological changes. Here
   we employ a longitudinal experiment to ask whether personality changes
   in response to the experience of parenting in male threespine
   sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Life history theory predicts that
   males should be less risk averse after successfully parenting, and the
   neuroendocrinology of parenting suggests that parenting could reorganize
   the hormonal landscape and behaviour of fathers. We randomly assigned
   males to either an experimental group (reproduced and parented) or a
   control group (did not reproduce and parent), and repeatedly measured a
   personality trait ('boldness') and 11-ketotestosterone levels (11-kT,
   the major androgen in fishes) in individual males. In the control group,
   males became bolder over time. However, in the experimental group,
   boldness did not change. Furthermore, 11-kT changed dramatically in the

Abstract = {{Many animal societies rely on highly influential keystone individuals
   for proper functioning. When information quality is important for group
   success, such keystone individuals have the potential to diminish group
   performance if they possess inaccurate information. Here, we test
   whether information quality (accurate or inaccurate) influences
   collective outcomes when keystone individuals are the first to acquire
   it. We trained keystone or generic individuals to attack or avoid novel
   stimuli and implanted these trained individuals within groups of naive
   colony-mates. We subsequently tracked how quickly groups learned about
   their environment in situations that matched (accurate information) or
   mismatched (inaccurate information) the training of the trained
   individual. We found that colonies with just one accurately informed
   individual were quicker to learn to attack a novel prey stimulus than
   colonies with no informed individuals. However, this effect was no more
   pronounced when the informed individual was a keystone individual. In
   contrast, keystones with inaccurate information had larger effects than
   generic individuals with identical information: groups containing
   keystones with inaccurate information took longer to learn to
   attack/avoidprey/predator stimuli and gained less weight than groups
   harbouring generic individuals with identical information. Our results
   convey that misinformed keystone individuals can become points of
   vulnerability for their societies.}},

Abstract = {{In animals, personality variations in response to stress and energy
   demands have been established. Cognitive processing of negative stimuli
   correlates with stress response patterns. Still, the relative
   contribution of cognitive appraisal or physiological demands to the
   behavioural output needs to be clarified. In this study we utilized
   reactive (high-responsive, HR) and proactive (low-responsive, LR)
   rainbow trout strains to investigate how contrasting reactions to
   hypoxia are related to individual variation in metabolism and/or
   cognition. The HR-LR strains did not differ in standard metabolic rate
   or hypoxia tolerance. HR trout displayed more pronounced avoidance to a
   signal cue after being conditioned with hypoxia, suggesting that they
   experienced this stimulus more aversive than LR trout. Together with
   differences in forebrain c-fos activation patterns in dorsomedial
   pallium, these results suggest cognitive differences between the
   strains. These results demonstrate that differences in
   personality/stress coping style can be related to contrasts in
   cognition, which are independent of metabolic differences.}},

Abstract = {{While among-individual variation in behaviour, or personality, is common
   across taxa, its mechanistic underpinnings are poorly understood. The
   Pace of Life syndrome (POLS) provides one possible explanation for
   maintenance of personality differences. POLS predicts that metabolic
   differences will covary with behavioural variation, with high metabolism
   associated with risk prone behaviour and `faster' life histories (e.g.,
   high growth, early maturation). We used a repeated measures approach,
   assaying metabolic traits (rate and scope), behaviour and growth to test
   these predictions in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We
   found that while individuals varied significantly in their behaviour and
   growth rate, more risk prone individuals did not grow significantly
   faster. Furthermore, after accounting for body size there was no support
   for among-individual variation in metabolic traits. Thus, while
   personality differences are clearly present in this population, they do
   not covary with metabolism and the POLS framework is not supported.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on animal behaviour have suggested a link between personality
   and energy expenditure. However, most models assume constant variation
   within individuals, even though individuals vary between observations.
   Such variation is called intraindividual variation in behaviour (IIV).
   We investigate if IIV in the duration of the startle response is
   associated with metabolic rates (MR) in the hermit crab Pagurus
   bernhardus. We repeatedly measured startle response durations and MR
   during each observation. We used double hierarchical generalized linear
   models to ask whether among and IIV in behaviour was underpinned by MR.
   We found no association between the mean duration of the startle
   responses and either routine MR orMR during startle response.
   Nevertheless, we found that IIV increased with MR during startle
   responses and decreased with routine MR. These results indicate that
   crabs with higher MR during startle responses behave less predictably,
   and that predictability is reduced during exposure to elevated
   temperatures.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},
Pages = {{1589-1610}},
Abstract = {{Physiological stress responses often correlate with personalities (e.g.,
   boldness). However, this relationship can become decoupled, although the
   mechanisms underlying changes in this relationship are poorly
   understood. Here we quantify (1) how an individual's boldness (response
   to novel objects) in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, changes in
   response to interactions with a population of either bold or shy
   conspecifics and we (2) measured associated post-stress cortisol levels.
   Initially-bold trout became shyer regardless of group composition,
   whereas shy trout remained shy demonstrating that bold individuals are
   more plastic. Stress-induced plasma cortisol reflected the original
   personality of fish but not the personality induced by the treatment,
   irrespective of population personality. Change in boldness of bold trout
   may indicate preference towards initially subordinate behaviour when
   joining a new population. However, here we provide further evidence that
   behavioural and physiological parameters of coping styles may become
   uncoupled whereby behavioural changes are not correlated with stress
   responsiveness.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},

Abstract = {{Variation in personality traits is predicted to reflect physiology, but
   the extent to which variations in stress hormones derive from
   differences in personality and/or state-dependent factors remains
   unclear. To investigate this, wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) were
   briefly brought into captivity and scored for personality and
   corticosterone (Cort) concentrations. More active females had lower
   baseline Cort than less active individuals. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia did not co-vary with baseline Cort. Stress-induced Cort
   concentrations were correlated negatively with exploratory tendency and
   haematocrit, but positively with mass gain in captivity. Therefore,
   baseline and stress-induced Cort concentrations in wintering blue tits
   were associated with state-dependent variables, sex, age and personality
   traits. Key to interpreting the physiology of personality traits seems
   to be their interactions with other traits that mediate ability to
   utilise resources, and thus influence an individual's perception of its
   current and future energy balance.}},

Title = {{Variation among free-living spotted hyenas in three personality traits}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},
Pages = {{1665-1722}},
Abstract = {{Inter-individual differences in behaviour, termed `animal personality',
   are often consistent over time and across contexts and can be
   significantly related to fitness. However, most studies of animal
   personality are conducted in the laboratory or involve experimental
   protocols. Here, we used longitudinal scan and all-occurrence data
   collected under naturalistic conditions over 21 years to study boldness,
   aggressiveness, and sociability in a wild population of spotted hyenas
   (Crocuta crocuta). We found significant variation among individual
   hyenas in all three traits; however, whereas both sexes exhibited
   consistent inter-individual differences in aggressiveness and
   sociability, males were less consistent than females in their boldness.
   Heritability and maternal effects were small but significant for both
   boldness and sociability. A large proportion of the variation in
   aggressiveness could be attributed to genetic and maternal effects,
   supporting previous research linking hormone exposure in utero to
   aggressive behaviour later in life. All three traits were correlated
   with at least one measure of fitness. Particularly aggressive females
   were more successful in raising their offspring to reproductive maturity
   than less aggressive females. Interestingly, the reproductive benefits
   of sociability depended on social rank; for low-ranking hyenas, gaining
   feeding tolerance via sociability may significantly enhance reproductive
   success. Both boldness and sociability were linked to survival, but
   these traits affected longevity in different ways; highly social hyenas
   lived longer than those that were less social, but selection on boldness
   was stabilizing, favoring hyenas with intermediate boldness values that
   balance the benefits of risky behaviour against risks of injury and
   death.}},

   profiles of aggressive male sticklebacks to nonaggressive males in four

   between behavioural types in telencephalon, cerebellum and diencephalon,
   but hundreds of genes were differentially expressed in brainstem, a
   brain area involved in detecting threats. Six genes that were
   differentially expressed in response to a territorial intrusion in a
   previous study were also differentially expressed between behavioural
   types in this study, implying primarily non-shared but some shared
   molecular mechanisms. Our findings offer new insights into the molecular
   causes and correlates of behavioural plasticity and individual variation

Abstract = {{Individual animals show consistent differences in behavioural responses
   when coping with environmental challenges. Consistency over time and
   across context in a behavioural trait is an indication for animal
   personality. Chronotypes refer to consistent inter-individual
   differences in diurnal rhythmicity driven by underlying variation in
   circadian clock processes. Personality traits and chronotype may relate
   to a single behavioural syndrome, but few studies have investigated such
   a link explicitly. Here, we explored zebrafish larvae for the presence
   of consistency in activity levels and timing, and their correlation with
   and without external cues (Zeitgeber: light-dark cycle versus constant
   light). We found individual consistency in activity level and timing,
   and their correlation independent of the presence of Zeitgeber:
   early-active individuals were less active overall than late-active
   individuals. Our study suggests a link between personality and
   chronotype and provides new insights into the early development of
   individual variation in behavioural tendencies of zebrafish.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{13-14, SI}},
Pages = {{1777-1793}},
Abstract = {{The field of animal personality has received considerable attention in
   past decades, yet few studies have examined personality in the wild.
   This study investigated docility, a measure of boldness, in two Port
   Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) populations using field
   tests, and if laterality differences explained docility levels. We
   developed a struggle test as an assay for docility, which is
   particularly amenable to field studies. The struggle test was effective,
   and repeatable inter-individual docility differences were observed. Sex,
   but not population, influenced docility scores, with male sharks being
   less docile than females. This difference is likely due to the
   contrasting role each sex plays during mating. We also found
   individualized lateralization. However, no individual-level relationship
   between lateralization and docility was detected. Despite reported links
   between laterality and some personality traits, the relationship between
   laterality and boldness remains inconclusive in sharks. Further studies
   will prove essential to clarify the mechanisms behind personality traits
   in vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Personality affects how animals respond to challenging circumstances and
   may affect the success of conservation translocations. To assess
   personality in translocated Stephens' kangaroo rats we exposed animals
   to a mirror to simulate a conspecific and to predator scent. Observers
   made subjective ratings of animals using 16 traits and recorded
   behaviour. We assayed faecal cortisol at time of capture and during
   captivity. We identified three personality dimensions: Assertiveness,
   Excitability, and Persistence. Individuals received similar scores for
   these dimensions in the two tests, suggesting consistent differences
   across context. High-Assertiveness animals showed risky behaviour, and
   had lower baseline cortisol. Assertiveness corresponds to
   `proactive-reactive coping' described for other rodents.
   High-Excitability animals were scored as high for Anxious and Fearful;
   this dimension may correspond to `emotional-reactivity' described in
   rats. Considering personality in translocations may allow selection of
   individuals who better cope with stressors, and may identify individuals
   needing special care to survive translocation.}},

   with measures from emergence and predator-exposure tests; we interpreted
   it as the closest approximation of boldness. PC-1 and PC-3 described
   different aspects of feeding such as foraging activity and rate,

Abstract = {{Studies of integrated phenotypes sometimes reveal correlations between
   mating effort, favoured by sexual selection, and risk-taking, favoured
   by survival selection. We used Girardinus metallicus to examine the
   relationship between rank order of mating effort and risk-taking. We
   measured risk-taking in a novel environment containing a predator. We
   then paired males, using aggression to assign dominant or subordinate
   status, and examined mating behaviour. Dominant males showed higher
   mating effort, but did not exhibit any relationship between risk-taking
   and mating effort. Subordinate males exhibited a cross-context
   correlation, as males were either more willing to take risks and
   aggressive or more hesitant to take risks and nonaggressive. Less
   risk-averse, aggressive subordinate males may gain fitness advantages in
   a more realistic dominance hierarchy, despite being outranked by the
   rival with which they were paired in our study. Results highlight
   intraspecific variation in behavioural correlations and the importance

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in animal behaviour are an
   increasingly common focus of research across various behavioural and
   biological sciences. Such `animal personalities' comprise a diverse
   repertoire of behavioural tendencies, recently expanding to incorporate
   the social domain. Aggression and peace, hallmarks of many social
   systems including that of humans, warrant integration with this
   literature. Specifically, animal personality research should consider
   the potential role of stable conflict and post-conflict behavioural
   tendencies. We focus our discussion primarily on examples in nonhuman
   primates and humans, but suggest that individual variation patterns are
   relevant for any social species in which these phenomena exist. In
   highly gregarious species, an individual's conflict and post-conflict
   tendencies can affect the strength and stability of its social bonds.
   Because social relationships in turn impact survival and reproductive
   success, we also encourage future work to investigate the ultimate
   (i.e., fitness-relevant) consequences of individual variation in
   aggressive and peaceful behaviour.}},

Title = {{It's a trap: sampling bias due to animal personality is not always

Abstract = {{Within a population, individuals can often exhibit consistent
   differences in a range of behaviors across time and context (behavioral
   type) that are also correlated (behavioral syndrome). Recently, it has
   been suggested that an individual's behavioral type can influence its
   probability of detection and capture during sampling. As a result,
   certain trapping methods may be inherently biased toward targeting a
   non-random sample of the population with wide ranging implications-from
   the way we conduct ecological research to the management and
   conservation of species. But is sampling bias always inevitable?
   Currently, studies have focused almost exclusively on the efficacy of
   passive trapping methods (e.g., baited traps) that rely on the arrival
   and inspection of animals, where bold, explorative individuals are
   typically oversampled. Whether more active search strategies result in
   similar bias remains unclear. In this study, we compared 3 different
   trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping, and mealworm fishing)
   in their ability to capture a range of behavioral types within a
   population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We also tested
   whether a behavioral syndrome was present. Although significant
   behavioral variation existed within the population, we found no
   difference between individuals caught in the 3 trapping methods among 5
   behavioral traits. However, we did find the presence of a behavioral
   syndrome, where skinks that were consistently more active, explored an
   environment faster and were more likely to bask with other skinks. We
   suggest that trapping bias is not ubiquitous but instead might only be
   associated with passive trapping methods that involve the response of
   animals to novelty.}},

Abstract = {{Although individual environmental factors influence behavioral
   plasticity, animals live in complex environments wherein multiple
   environmental factors vary simultaneously. Here, we investigated whether
   temperature and food intake independently or interactively affected the
   boldness and feeding behavior of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis
   guttatus, Linnaeus). Because thermal environments in which animals can
   behaviorally thermoregulate by moving among microclimates are likely
   more realistic and ecologically relevant than fluctuating or constant
   temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred
   thermal microclimates (control vs. warm regimes) for 8 weeks and allowed
   individuals to move among microclimates. By also manipulating food
   intake and controlling for phenotypic repeatability of behavior, we
   demonstrate context-specific effects of temperature and food intake on
   behavioral plasticity. Temperature and food intake independently
   affected feeding behavior (i.e., unidimensional plasticity), but these
   factors interactively affected boldness in an open arena (i.e.,
   multidimensional plasticity). Clearly, complex environments can exert
   multifaceted effects on behavior. Therefore, examining the effects of
   individual environmental factors (e.g., temperature or food
   availability) may be an overly simplistic approach to understanding how
   animals respond to rapidly changing environments.}},

   hatchling snakes}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{313-323}},
Abstract = {{An animal's susceptibility to risk may be partly dependent on its body
   size. But are larger individuals bolder? We assessed this question by
   measuring time to emerge from a shelter in repeated trials on hatchling
   keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii). Estimates of repeatability of
   emergence times suggested they measure some underlying personality
   dimension related to boldness. Larger hatchlings emerged from shelter
   sooner than small ones. Hatchling mass of keelbacks is substantially
   influenced both by maternal phenotype and by incubation conditions.
   Given the environmental basis of much of the variation in offspring
   size, the size-boldness association may reflect a facultative ability to
   adjust behavioural tactics to body size, as well as innate differences
   in personality traits between large versus small hatchlings. The link
   between size and boldness suggests that the survival advantage of larger
   offspring size in this population may be driven by snake behaviour as
   well as morphology.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{51-57}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in affective states in applied animal
   behaviour science, because these states are thought to reflect welfare
   from the perspective of the animals. Also, it can be expected that
   individuals differ in how they consistently react to emotional
   challenges. Recently, we conducted three experiments in which the same
   sheep were repeatedly confronted with either physical, social or thermal
   stimuli that presumably varied in their valence. These sheep had been
   housed in either unpredictable, stimulus-poor or predictable,
   stimulus-rich housing conditions in order to manipulate their long-term
   mood. When the sheep were exposed to the stimuli, we measured general
   activity, ear movements, ear postures and frontal cortical haemodynamic
   changes as indicator variables for their emotional reaction. In the
   meta-analysis presented here, we searched for effects of the presumed
   valence and mood state on the indicator variables. Furthermore, we
   investigated the unexplained between- versus within-subject variability
   as an indicator of personality. Deoxy- {[}HHb] and oxy-haemoglobin
   concentrations {[}O(2)Hb] as well as general activity showed weak linear
   relationships with presumed valence. Sheep from the unpredictable,
   stimulus-poor housing conditions were generally more active and showed
   more ear movements, higher absolute {[}HHb], more transverse ears and
   less left-forward ears than sheep from the predictable, stimulus-rich
   housing conditions. However, these differences were small. The ratio of
   between- to within-individual variability was very low indicating little
   consistency in individual reactions. In conclusion, we found only weak
   evidence that presumed valence had a consistent effect on the indicator
   variables for emotional reactions in a given sheep, and these reactions
   were not modulated by presumed mood. Also, there was little indication
   that the sheep reacted in a way reflecting an individualised
   personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Association between personality and stereotypic behaviours in the
   African striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{154-161}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Stereotypic behaviours, which are abnormal, repetitive and invariant
   behaviours caused by frustration and/or central nervous system
   dysfunction, develop as a result of sub-optimal captive conditions that
   provide inadequate motor and sensory stimulation. However, not all
   individuals housed under such conditions develop stereotypic behaviours.
   One hypothesis to explain such variation is personality (i.e.
   individual) differences. We tested this hypothesis in the African
   striped mouse Rhabdomys dilectus and predicted that stereotypic
   individuals would have a bolder personality and a proactive coping style
   than non-stereotypic individuals. We conducted two experiments. In the
   first experiment, adult stereotypic and non-stereotypic striped mice
   were tested for their personality using three tests (i.e. light-dark,
   startle-response and novel-object tests). Subsequently, we recorded the
   behaviours of individuals every second day for 30 days in standard
   laboratory housing. Stereotypic striped mice were proactive and showed a
   bolder personality type by spending longer time in the light compartment
   after a startle response, showed greater manipulation of cage objects
   and were more active than non-stereotypic individuals in standard
   housing. In the second experiment, we tested the personality of juvenile
   striped mice before the onset of stereotypic behaviours. Again, the
   startle response test correlated with the onset of stereotypic behaviour
   in adults, with stereotypic mice that spent more time in the light
   compartment (i.e. bolder) showing a greater likelihood of displaying
   stereotypic behaviours later. Although our data provides support for the
   association between personality and stereotypic behaviour, these
   group-level effects (stereotypic vs. non-stereotypic) were not evident
   at the individual level, particularly for stereotypic mice. Therefore,
   having a proactive coping style did not predict the onset of stereotypic
   behaviour for all stereotypic individuals, highlighting individual
   trajectories for the development of stereotypic behaviours. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species often consistently differ in their
   behaviour across time and context. These stable differences are usually
   termed `animal personality'. Parasitism is known to significantly
   influence the evolution of animal personality at least in part because
   more explorative individuals may meet parasites more frequently than
   less explorative ones. Previously, we have demonstrated that consistent
   individual differences (i.e. boldness, activity, exploration) can be
   measured in firebugs. As continuation, we examined here the relationship
   between firebug personality traits and their ectoparasitic mite loads in
   a wild population. We showed that bugs that behaved in a more
   explorative way have more mites and we also found a marginally
   significant interaction between sex, boldness and activity: bolder and
   more active female firebugs were more infected. In addition, we
   experimentally tested whether an artificial infection causes any
   alteration in the bug's behaviour and whether there is any relationship
   between firebug personality and immune response. This treatment did not
   induce any alteration in bugs' personality. We found that bugs become
   more explorative but less active when repeating the experiment, but at
   the same time all personality traits (boldness, activity and
   exploration) were repeatable. Furthermore, firebugs with a stronger
   immune response behaved more boldly but also less actively. (c) 2015

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{Social-rearing environment has profound effects on behaviour, physiology
   and development. A complex social environment enhances an individual's
   social skills and competence in many animal taxa. Consequently, complete
   social deprivation seriously impairs various aspects of behaviour,
   development, brain function and hormone levels. Although sexual
   selection is a major evolutionary force, studies investigating the
   effects of social environment on the development of reproductive
   behaviour are scarce. Thus, we aimed to examine how long-term social
   deprivation influenced sexual behaviour in both sexes of Pelvicachromis
   taeniatus, a biparental cichlid fish with mutual mate choice. In
   particular, we focused on intersexual behaviour, i.e. courtship and
   intrasexual aggression of fish reared and maintained either in a group
   or in isolation. We found significant differences between socially
   deprived and group-reared fish. Males and females reared in isolation
   were less likely to perform courtship behaviour and showed less interest
   towards potential mates than group-reared fish. Intrasexual aggression
   of isolated fish was reduced as well in both sexes. Furthermore, in
   males we found positive behavioural correlations between inter-and
   intrasexual behaviour at the individual level independent from the
   social-rearing environment. In females, this correlation was only found
   in group-reared fish, indicating an effect of social environment on
   behavioural correlations. Consequently, our results suggest that
   long-term social isolation seriously impairs social competence of P.
   taeniatus in sexual selection. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Individuals are different, but they can work together to perform
   adaptive collective behaviours. Despite emerging evidence that
   individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less
   clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation
   in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative
   phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both
   solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibited
   idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persisted across days,
   with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75\% of the
   time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. similar to
   50\% of the time). These individual differences were robust to group
   composition. Surprisingly, these differences did not persist when
   individuals were tested in isolation, but returned when testing was once
   again done in groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches
   exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these
   differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context.
   Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects
   group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is
   performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how
   an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is
   modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major
   implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are
   facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider
   social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences. (C)

Abstract = {{The last decade has seen lots of studies on animal personality' (i.e.
   the study of consistent between-individual behavioural differences). As
   timely and promising as this field is, its development has come with a
   diversity of research questions. As an unfortunate consequence, it now
   suffers from substantial confusion about what animal personality' is,
   and how relevant related research frameworks are. Here, we stress the
   current inconsistencies and sources of confusion pertaining to the
   field, and their consequences on terminology used and miscommunication
   between researchers. In an attempt to unravel and clarify the concepts
   underlying the field, we identify two distinct, but complementary,
   theory-driven conceptual frameworks: the intra-individual variability
   (IIV) approach and the life-history (LH) approach, which we believe
   encompass the vast majority of existing personality studies'. Finally,
   we argue in favour of theory-driven studies of consistent behavioural
   differences and state that the integrative statistical properties of
   random regression models should not override the merit of alternative
   conceptual frameworks. We then provide brief guidelines and warnings for
   a parsimonious and sound use of terminology.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural differences between individuals are often found to be
   consistent across contexts and/or over time, although recent studies
   suggest that ontogenetic processes and learning might influence
   personality. During ontogeny, environmental influences may play an
   important role in shaping an individual's personality as well as its
   physiology. Seasonal changes are ubiquitous and known to influence
   development. To study developmental plasticity, of behaviour and
   physiology in the wild cavy (Cavia aperea), we manipulated the
   photoperiod in a fully crossed match-mismatch design by simulating
   spring and autumn photoperiod until weaning and subsequently moving half
   of the animals into the mismatching photoperiod. We found developmental
   plasticity in behavioural and physiological traits before and after
   sexual maturation for growth, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness.
   For fearlessness, changes in response to the opposite photoperiod were
   more pronounced in males than in females. Exploration and boldness were
   only influenced by early, but not by late photoperiod. No sex
   differences were found for these two traits. Even though our treatment
   changed average trait expression, some behavioural traits proved
   consistent over time, but physiological traits were not. Fearlessness
   was consistent only in animals that did not change photoperiod during
   development, whereas exploration and boldness were consistent over time
   regardless of photoperiodic treatment. Our study shows that in response
   to a change in photoperiod personality traits differ substantially in
   developmental plasticity.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{Behaviours are the result of the interaction between genetic factors,
   past experiences, and labile environmental and social influences.
   Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than
   the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts.
   This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and
   is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness
   and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem
   to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore,
   personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the
   task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are
   expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better
   to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we
   report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a
   period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a
   spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both
   in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not
   differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower
   cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than
   slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds
   successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet,
   fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task,
   potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage
   earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with
   recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or
   proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the
   habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the
   reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the
   personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences
   in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological,
   metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in
   part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the
   phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental
   sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the
   hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life
   hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory
   propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta
   domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field
   behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether
   among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour
   and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable,
   but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits.
   Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits
   covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate.
   Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory
   propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary
   change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which
   selection can act more rapidly. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Climate change, such as elevated temperatures, may facilitate biological
   invasion. Aquatic animal systems are more vulnerable to biological
   invasion when the temperature rises. Animal personality also plays an
   important role in the possibility of successful establishment of
   invasive species. However, it is still unclear how personality traits of
   invasive species will respond to global warming. This study focuses on
   juveniles of red swamp crawfish Procambarus clarkii, an invasive
   poikilothermic species with wide distribution throughout the world, and
   explores how slight temperature increases influence three personality
   traits (activity, boldness and aggressiveness) of P. clarkii. For each
   personality, individual variation is to be presented in condition of the
   same temperature. Individual personality values can significantly
   increase with the subtle rising of water temperature. Significant
   correlations among activity, boldness and aggressiveness are found at
   any temperature stage, and such relationships are maintained at a
   similar level in the face of different temperatures. It is most likely
   that significant expressions of personality traits may be an ecological
   compensation strategy to offset increased metabolic costs when faced
   with small temperature increases. Aggression syndromes are formed due to
   stable linkages between personality traits, in order to acquire
   allopatric resources efficiently and establish a new population in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding space use remains a major challenge for animal ecology,
   with implications for species interactions, disease spread, and
   conservation. Behavioural type (BT) may shape the space use of
   individuals within animal populations. Bolder or more aggressive
   individuals tend to be more exploratory and disperse further. Yet, to
   date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal
   depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent
   space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern
   Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS)
   tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays,
   and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge
   resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that
   lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the
   neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other
   conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially
   aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to
   ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of
   these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when
   food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For
   example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the
   season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these
   predictors. These findings highlight a commonly overlooked source of
   heterogeneity in animal space use and improve our mechanistic
   understanding of processes leading to behaviourally driven disease
   dynamics and social structure.}},

Abstract = {{Two recent observations in behavioral biology have sparked great
   interest and have already yielded many novel and intriguing insights.
   Bacteria appear to live lives of unforeseen behavioral complexity, and
   the consistent behavioral variation among individual animals is often
   not ``noise{''} but turns out to be a highly relevant ecological and
   evolutionary feature in itself. Research covering these 2 phenomena has
   proceeded largely in isolation, and the rich behavioral lives of
   bacteria have not yet been studied with consistent interindividual
   behavioral differences in mind. Yet, the parallels between animal and
   bacterial behavior that are increasingly being uncovered, as well as the
   particular characteristics of bacteria, point toward a new approach in
   the study of consistent individual variation in behavior. Using bacteria
   can bring fruitful opportunities to the field and allows researchers to
   address questions that are very difficult to pursue using animal model
   systems. Notwithstanding a few challenges, bacteria can provide an
   alternative study system that may elucidate several evolutionary and
   ecological aspects of consistent individual behavioral variation.}},

Abstract = {{The study of personality has aroused much interest and has provided
   insight into the understanding of animal behavior. Nevertheless, the
   study of the ecological consequences of personality is a newer field
   that could shed light on cases of alien species introductions. The
   goldfish (Carassius auratus) is frequently introduced worldwide and
   affects the abundance of newts, having an especially negative impact on
   an alternative phenotype, the paedomorph, which maintains larval traits
   at the adult stage, unlike the other phenotype, the metamorph, which has
   undergone metamorphosis. We experimentally assessed the impact of
   goldfish on the foraging behavior of both phenotypes of palmate newts
   (Lissotriton helveticus). More particularly, we assessed fish
   personality by analyzing the foraging activity and the aggressiveness
   toward newts, and newt personality by analyzing individual difference in
   boldness. In the presence of fish, fewer newts foraged than in their
   absence, and paedomorphs were more affected than metamorphs. We found
   strong personality differences in fish and fewer newts foraged in the
   presence of a more aggressive fish. Newts differed in boldness, but fish
   aggressiveness remains a key factor to explain newt behavior. Studying
   behavioral interactions between native and alien species helps to
   understand the mechanisms of coexistence and exclusion and why different
   phenotypes might be affected differently by the same threat. To a great
   extent, not only the presence of fish alters the foraging opportunities
   of newts but also the personality of the invader; integrating
   personality patterns of invaders is therefore a key to understanding the
   ecological consequences of alien species introduction.}},

Volume = {{120}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Tropical rainforests are species-rich, complex ecosystems. They are
   increasingly being negatively affected by anthropogenic activity, which
   is rapidly and unpredictably altering their structure and complexity.
   These changes in habitat state may expose tropical animals to novel and
   unpredictable conditions, potentially increasing their extinction risk.
   However, an animal's ability to cope with environmental change may be
   linked to its personality. While numerous studies have investigated
   environmental influences on animal personalities, few are focused on
   tropical species. In this review, we consider how behavioural syndromes
   in tropical species might facilitate coping under, and adapting to,
   increasing disturbance. Given the complexity of tropical rainforests, we
   first discuss how habitat complexity influences personality traits and
   physiological stress in general. We then explore the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of personality in the tropics in the context
   of behavioural flexibility, range expansion and speciation. Finally, we
   discuss the impact that anthropogenic environmental change may have on
   the ecological integrity of tropical rainforests, positing scenarios for
   species persistence. Maintaining tropical rainforest complexity is
   crucial for driving behavioural flexibility and personality type, both
   of which are likely to be key factors facilitating long term persistence
   in disturbed habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency is a key assumption when evaluating how
   between-individual differences in behaviour influence life history
   tactics. Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural
   repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural
   repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have
   investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status
   (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed
   to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the
   repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to
   human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer,
   Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at
   both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural
   trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly
   between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males
   than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual
   variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with
   individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life
   history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report
   here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{177-185}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural correlations between mating behaviour and antipredator
   behaviour are expected when sexual behaviour increases predation risk.
   However, the correlation would be different between males and females,
   particularly when the sexes experience different levels of predation
   risk. Here, we tested this idea using a water strider species, Gerris
   gracilicornis (Heteroptera: Gerridae). G. gracilicornis males employ an
   unusual intimidating courtship strategy capitalizing on predator
   behaviours and female response to predators. Since mounted females are
   more vulnerable than males to predatory attacks from below, we predicted
   that changes in female mating behaviours across predation contexts
   (boldness in a mating context) should be associated with female
   antipredator behaviours (boldness in a nonmating context), but that the
   correlation would be weaker for male mating behaviours. In a series of
   behavioural assays, we measured water striders' (1) mating behaviour in
   the absence of predators, (2) mating behaviour in the presence of
   predation risk, (3) boldness in the mating context (changes in female
   mating behaviour after predator attacks) and (4) boldness in the
   nonmating context. We found that females behaved more cautiously around
   predators in both the mating and nonmating contexts. We also found that
   females' boldness in the mating context was significantly correlated
   with their boldness in the nonmating context. In contrast to females,
   antipredator behaviour of males in the nonmating context did not
   correlate with their boldness in the mating context. Thus we suggest
   that sex differences in boldness across predation contexts appear to
   cause sex-specific behavioural syndromes. (C) 2015 The Association for

Abstract = {{Consistency of between-individual differences in behaviour or
   personality is a phenomenon in populations that can have ecological
   consequences and evolutionary potential. One way that behaviour can
   evolve is to have a genetic basis. Identifying the molecular genetic
   basis of personality could therefore provide insight into how and why
   such variation is maintained, particularly in natural populations.
   Previously identified candidate genes for personality in birds include
   the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), and serotonin transporter (SERT).
   Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory and bold
   behaviours are associated with polymorphisms in both DRD4 and SERT. Here
   we tested for polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT in the Seychelles warbler
   (Acrocephalus sechellensis) population on Cousin Island, Seychelles, and
   then investigated correlations between personality and polymorphisms in
   these genes. We found no genetic variation in DRD4, but identified four
   polymorphisms in SERT that clustered into five haplotypes. There was no
   correlation between bold or exploratory behaviours and SERT
   polymorphisms/haplotypes. The null result was not due to lack of power,
   and indicates that there was no association between these behaviours and
   variation in the candidate genes tested in this population. These null
   findings provide important data to facilitate representative future
   meta-analyses on candidate personality genes.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing interest in animal social networks, surprisingly little
   is known about whether individuals are consistent in their social
   network characteristics. Networks are rarely repeatedly sampled; yet an
   assumption of individual consistency in social behaviour is often made
   when drawing conclusions about the consequences of social processes and
   structure. A characterization of such social phenotypes is therefore
   vital to understanding the significance of social network structure for
   individual fitness outcomes, and for understanding the evolution and
   ecology of individual variation in social behaviour more broadly. Here,
   we measured foraging associations over three winters in a large
   PIT-tagged population of great tits, and used a range of social network
   metrics to quantify individual variation in social behaviour. We then
   examined repeatability in social behaviour over both short (week to
   week) and long (year to year) timescales, and investigated variation in
   repeatability across age and sex classes. Social behaviours were
   significantly repeatable across all timescales, with the highest
   repeatability observed in group size choice and unweighted degree, a
   measure of gregariousness. By conducting randomizations to control for
   the spatial and temporal distribution of individuals, we further show
   that differences in social phenotypes were not solely explained by
   within-population variation in local densities, but also reflected
   fine-scale variation in social decision making. Our results provide rare
   evidence of stable social phenotypes in a wild population of animals.
   Such stable social phenotypes can be targets of selection and may have
   important fitness consequences, both for individuals and for their
   social-foraging associates. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published on behalf of

Title = {{Contribution of within-litter interactions to individual differences in
   early postnatal growth in the domestic rabbit}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{145-153}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Interactions with littermates are an important component of the early
   environment of altricial mammals, frequently with major consequence for
   individual development, growth and survival. Early differences in
   starting mass within litters are often predictive of individual
   differences in behaviour and development, although to what extent such
   differences are independent of (epi) genetic factors is not always
   clear. In our study on domestic rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, we
   created experimentally mixed litters consisting of either heavier or
   lighter pups obtained from different litters at birth and raised by
   foster mothers. We hypothesized that pups' body mass relative to their
   new littermates would determine the nature of their social interactions
   with consequences for their early growth, largely independent of their
   absolute or relative body mass in their litters of origin. As predicted,
   pups with a higher starting mass on postnatal day 1 compared to members
   of their new litter consistently had more neighbours in the litter
   huddle, thus reflecting their more central position. In turn, pups with
   more neighbours had relatively higher body temperatures, greater milk
   intake and a higher milk conversion ratio, resulting in relatively
   greater growth during the first critical postnatal week. Relative body
   mass in the litter of origin or absolute body mass had no notable
   effect, indicating that the observed developmental patterns were truly
   driven by pups' body mass relative to their current littermates rather
   than being a consequence of (epi) genetic effects potentially associated
   with their birth mass. In conclusion, our study underlines the
   importance of interactions among siblings in shaping individual
   differences in early growth and development largely independent of
   genetic factors. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, it has been recognized that in many animal
   species, individuals present consistent behavioral differences across
   time and/or contexts, thus defining personality traits. A general
   relationship seems to exist between personality and fitness in wild
   populations, which raises the question as to how variation in
   personality is maintained in the presence of selection. Fluctuating
   selection associated with a heterogeneous environment could contribute
   to maintaining personality variation, but its presence in wild
   populations has rarely been tested. In this 6-year study, we
   investigated the relationship between individual personality differences
   and 1 component of fitness, annual reproductive success (ARS), in a
   population of Siberian chipmunk Tamias sibiricus that experiences
   considerable annual variations in food availability. We estimated
   trappability-the propensity of chipmunks to enter traps-using
   capture-mark-recapture data, and we showed that it was repeatable over a
   1-year interval. Genetic data were used to estimate parentage and thus
   ARS. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found
   that bolder chipmunks had higher ARS in years with low food
   availability, whereas lower ARS in years with high food availability.
   Temporally fluctuating selection therefore probably contributes to
   maintaining variation in boldness in the study population.}},

Title = {{Personality affects mate choice: bolder males show stronger audience

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1314-1325}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Males in various species adjust their mate choice to sperm competition
   risk and intensity arising when females potentially mate with several
   competing males. If males use social information and copy other males'
   choices, this leads to an increased likelihood of sperm competition for
   both, the copying and the copied male. In livebearing fishes
   (Poeciliidae), males appear to avoid the risk of being copied by
   temporarily moving away from preferred females and approaching
   nonpreferred ones ({''}audience effect{''}), thereby exploiting the
   rival's propensity to copy. Responding to rival presence with an
   audience effect bears the risk of losing the initially preferred female,
   which may swim away, but may help to reduce sperm competition intensity.
   Males may rate this risk-benefit ratio differentially depending on their
   personality, for example, more risk-taking (bolder) males might be more
   likely to respond to an audience. Using Atlantic mollies (Poecilia
   mexicana) as our study organism, we characterized focal and audience
   males along the boldness-activity behavioral axis. As overall
   competition levels are known to affect male mate choice, we subjected
   half of the males to a low competition (single-male housing) and the
   other half to a high-competition treatment (group housing) before they
   were tested in binary mate choice tests. Only males from the high
   competition treatment responded to rival presence with an audience
   effect. In congruence with our prediction, bolder males within this
   cohort showed a stronger audience effect. Our study exemplifies that
   (depending on the social context) bolder, not shyer, individuals can be
   more responsive to their social environment.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{Correlations among behavioral traits can generate trade-offs and
   constrain phenotypic evolution. Interspecific hybridization has the
   potential to alter behavioral trait correlations, but the effect of
   hybridization on suites of behavioral traits has received relatively
   little attention. We evaluated how natural hybridization changes the
   relationship between boldness (time of emergence and proportion of time
   out of shelter) and response to a simulated predator threat in
   swordtails (Teleostei: Xiphophorus). In poeciliid fishes, bold
   individuals have increased survival in the presence of predators. This
   non-intuitive observation may arise as a result of bold individuals
   being more likely to engage in anti-predator behaviors. Contrary to our
   prediction, bold individuals were less likely to perform a fast-start
   response to a predator threat. This correlation was consistent among
   populations and species but was only significant in hybrids. The
   observed correlation between boldness and anti-predator behavior could
   impact hybrid fitness and the evolvability of hybrid lineages. More
   generally, our findings suggest that hybridization could influence the
   integration of behavioral phenotypes, as has been amply documented for
   morphology. Animal personality and behavioral syndromes could therefore
   play an important role in the evolutionary fate of natural hybrids}},

Title = {{The backtest in pigs revisited - An analysis of intra-situational
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{17-25}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of different behavioural phenotypes in animals (regarding
   temperament and personality) has increasingly attracted the attention of
   scientists dealing with farm animal breeding, management and welfare. As
   part of the adaptation repertoire, coping behaviour describes how
   animals deal with challenging situations. To detect different coping
   strategies (active vs. passive) in domestic pigs, Hessing et al. (1993)
   suggested using the backtest at an early age. However, the literature
   contains ambiguous results and criticism of the backtest. Thus,
   referring to Jensen (1995), the aim of our study was to analyse the
   backtest in terms of intra-situational behaviour (frequency
   distribution, behavioural consistency, heritability) in a large sample
   of domestic piglets (n = 3555). By using a statistical resampling
   analysis we wanted to verify whether the individual variation in the
   behaviour of the piglets in the repeated backtest indicates coping
   strategies or just random variation. The backtest was repeated four
   times between the first and fourth week of life (ages 5, 12, 19 and 26
   days), and the latency, total duration and frequency of all struggling
   attempts were recorded. Our results show a continuous, unimodal
   distribution in the frequency parameter and an apparent bimodal
   distribution in the latency and duration parameter, that probably
   represents a unimodal distribution with a `ceiling-effect'. The
   intra-test consistency of the behaviour (Spearman rank correlation
   (r(S)) and repeatability (R)) was moderate (r(S) = 0.19-0.45, p < 0.001;
   R = 0.25-0.39), indicating at least a certain degree of behavioural
   consistency. The resampling analysis revealed that the piglets did not
   show just random variation in behaviour. Moreover, the piglets did not
   display a general habituation to the repeated backtest. Based on a large
   pedigree, we calculated that the heritability of the behavioural
   parameters ranged from 0.17 to 0.43. In conclusion, the repeated
   backtest does not provide evidence for definitive coping strategies that
   are clearly separable. We instead found pronounced individual
   dispositions that are partly determined by genetics along a continuum
   from active to passive coping behaviour. This means that individuals
   show both behavioural consistency and flexibility in behaviour. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Social foraging is common and may provide benefits of safety and public
   information. Public information permits faster and more accurate
   estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective
   foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots
   Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on
   intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red
   knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance
   status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the
   foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither
   dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the
   second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether
   public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch
   residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food
   patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's
   number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group
   size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as
   well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some
   birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We
   conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly
   increase their food-finding rate by using public information. This
   article is part of a Special Issue entitled: In Honor of Jerry Hogan.

Abstract = {{The development and persistence of personality in nature are
   counterintuitive because, in heterogeneous environments, personality is
   expected to limit the degree of behavioural flexibility. Recent work has
   shown that personality and behavioural flexibility might be linked, but
   their interaction is not well understood and could be elucidated by
   studying a socially flexible species. Using well-established tests, we
   measured the personality traits of activity, boldness, exploration and
   aggressiveness in free-living striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in South
   Africa. Specifically, we tested whether personality changes when
   individuals change their reproductive tactic, either from group-living
   philopatrics to solitary-living females and roaming males or from
   non-breeding philopatrics to breeders. Our results showed that striped
   mice have personalities: Individuals behaved consistently for all the
   behavioural traits measured both over time and contexts (breeding to
   non-breeding season). While most of the personality traits measured
   remained consistent among tactics, they did not predict which tactic an
   individual would adopt next, suggesting that environmental conditions
   rather than personality influence tactic switching. Additionally, we
   found important differences in the consistency of the behaviours
   measured between males and females, indicating that sexual selection
   might play a prominent role in the maintenance of personality in this
   species. Our study demonstrates that some personality traits can be
   stable over an entire lifetime even in socially flexible species and
   that personality does not constrain social flexibility.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Geographic range has long been noted to be associated with many
   organismic and ecological traits such as body size and species richness.
   However, much less is known about whether and how ecological variation
   across latitudinal gradients reflects behavioral variation. Ant colonies
   may also show behavioral variation, and Temnothorax rugatulus show a
   colony-level behavioral syndrome that seems to reflect risk tolerance
   across their North American range. While it is presumed that this
   pattern is the result of adaptation to local environmental conditions,
   which ecological factors are driving this variation are unknown. Here,
   we test if colony risk tolerance is affected by competition, predation,
   resource availability, or environmental stress at each site. Our results
   show that increased competition, specifically for nest sites, as well as
   increased spatial clustering of colonies predicts higher risk tolerance.
   Additionally, the spatial clustering of colonies influences the
   structure of the risk-taking syndrome, i.e., which colony-level
   behaviors are correlated and how strongly. This emphasizes the need for
   understanding large-scale geographic variation in behavior, as it may
   explain how ecological factors drive the evolution and maintenance of
   intraspecific behavioral variation across populations.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Two classes of explanations for covariation between activity level and
   metabolic rate among conspecifics have been proposed. First,
   individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement
   of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because
   movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second,
   energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual
   activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of
   metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history
   traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential
   relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud
   crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of
   crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine
   metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms
   that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard
   metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both
   activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of
   predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne
   chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was
   repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship,
   individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab
   activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological
   relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to
   activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts
   behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves.
   We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic
   rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of
   considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional
   relationships between individual behavior and energetics.}},

Abstract = {{Investigating the proximate mechanism underlying behavior has long been
   a primary goal of ethologists. With the recent focus on behavioral
   correlations (e.g., behavioral syndromes), a fundamental question arises
   regarding what mechanisms may drive positive relationships between
   functionally distinct behaviors. Understanding these mechanisms can
   inform critical questions, such as why distinct behaviors are often
   correlated, and can also lend insights into how behavioral similarities
   are conserved across species. Arthropods provide an idea system to study
   these questions as the biogenic amines, such as octopamine and
   serotonin, have long been known to mediate a large number of behaviors
   such as aggression, dominance, escape behavior, and others. Behaviorists
   have several ways in which they can manipulate these biogenic amines
   invivo, including injection, feeding, and topical application. Topical
   application is potentially an optimal method for manipulating amine
   concentrations, given that it is minimally invasive and relatively
   precise. Here, we investigate the role of biogenic amines, octopamine,
   and serotonin, in mediating a range of similar and often correlated
   behaviors in two distantly related species of spiders, the western black
   widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the funnel-web spider, Agelenopsis
   pennsylvanica. Additionally, we investigate the behavioral effects
   associated with three commonly used carrier solvents: dimethylformamide
   (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetone. We demonstrate that
   biogenic amines are involved both in mediating several behaviors, and
   also potentially the links between different behaviors. We also show
   that the same behaviors in different species are not affected by
   biogenic amines in the same manner, suggesting differences in the
   underlying neurophysiological mechanisms governing behavior.
   Furthermore, we discovered large and pervasive effects associated with
   both carrier solvents, thus calling into question the potential
   usefulness and interpretability of topical application methods in
   behavioral research.}},

Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Large scale coordination without dominant, consistent leadership is
   frequent in nature. How individuals emerge from within the group as
   leaders, however transitory this position may be, has become an
   increasingly common question asked. This question is further complicated
   by the fact that in many of these aggregations, differences between
   individuals are minor and the group is largely considered to be
   homogeneous. In the simulations presented here, we investigate the
   emergence of leadership in the extreme situation in which all
   individuals are initially identical. Using a mathematical model
   developed using observations of natural systems, we show that the
   addition of a simple concept of leadership tendencies which is inspired
   by observations of natural systems and is affected by experience can
   produce distinct leaders and followers using a nonlinear feedback loop.
   Most importantly, our results show that small differences in experience
   can promote the rapid emergence of stable roles for leaders and
   followers. Our findings have implications for our understanding of
   adaptive behaviors in initially homogeneous groups, the role experience
   can play in shaping leadership tendencies, and the use of
   self-assessment in adapting behavior and, ultimately,
   self-role-assignment.}},

Abstract = {{Wild crickets show consistent patterns of behavior over their adult
   lifetimes and as they get older they become increasingly predictable. We
   tagged crickets and then periodically recaptured them and measured their
   behavior in the lab. This revealed that rather than variation in how age
   affects behavior, there were consistent patterns across the whole
   population. We do not have a situation where some crickets live fast and
   die young while others take it easy and slow.Investigating patterns of
   among and within-individual trait variation in populations is essential
   to understanding how selection shapes phenotypes. Behavior is often the
   most flexible aspect of the phenotype, and to understand how it is
   affected by selection, we need to examine how consistent individuals
   are. However, it is not well understood whether among-individual
   differences tend to remain consistent over lifetimes, or whether the
   behavior of individuals relative to one another varies over time. We
   examined the dynamics of 4 behavioral traits (tendency to leave a
   refuge, shyness, activity, and exploration) in a wild population of
   field crickets (Gryllus campestris). We tagged individuals and then
   temporarily removed them from their natural environment and tested them
   under laboratory conditions. All 4 traits showed among-individual
   variance in mean levels of expression across the adult lifespan, but no
   significant differences in how rapidly expression changed with age. For
   all traits, among-individual variance increased as individuals got
   older. Our findings reveal seldom examined changes in variance
   components over the adult lifetime of wild individuals. Such changes
   will have important implications for the relationship between behavioral
   traits, life-histories, and fitness and the consequences of selection on
   wild individuals.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1071-1082}},

Abstract = {{We examine the causes of variation in personality traits among human
   hunter-horticulturalists. Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial
   aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious
   cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the
   possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the
   heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the
   heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest
   personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's
   phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality
   origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but
   pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short
   supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among
   Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of
   cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human
   prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial
   personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in
   ``embodied capital{''}aEuro{''}that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic
   traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this
   hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital-physical strength and
   formal education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial
   leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing
   gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership.
   Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength
   and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO,
   which suggests that prosocial traits may be ``reactively heritable{''}
   by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of
   embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in
   future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations
   of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society
   and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to
   elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by
   virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable
   interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how
   the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level
   phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual
   differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals'
   participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group
   composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition,
   group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We
   performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory
   conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and
   (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the
   laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task
   participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size:
   larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to
   participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies
   composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of
   attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our
   field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which
   colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size,
   morphological composition and personality composition; none of these
   effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found
   that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more
   spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that
   colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by
   spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics. The

Abstract = {{Social relationships vary in content, quality and patterning. Most
   researchers focus on whether and how nondispositional factors, including
   age, sex, kinship and rank, predict variance in the content, quality and
   patterning of relationships. However, within a species, these factors do
   not always predict partner choice. We examined whether similarity in any
   of five personality traits, Assertiveness, Openness, Neuroticism,
   Sociability and Attentiveness, independently contributed to variation in
   the affiliative and agonistic relationships of pairs of brown capuchin
   monkeys, Sapajus sp. Capuchins that were more similar in Neuroticism had
   higher affiliative relationship scores, while capuchins that were more
   similar in Sociability shared overall higher-quality relationships (i.e.
   the difference between the dyad's affiliative and agonistic scores).
   These effects were independent of age, sex, kinship and rank, suggesting
   that certain aspects of the psychology of these animals may contribute
   uniquely to the quality of their social relationships. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Using repeatability to study physiological and behavioural traits:
   ignore time-related change at your peril}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{223-230}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Broad sense repeatability, which refers to the extent to which
   individual differences in trait scores are maintained over time, is of
   increasing interest to researchers studying behavioural or physiological
   traits. Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the
   statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability).
   However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal
   nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by
   showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating
   broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power.
   Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related
   change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect
   estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or
   physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of
   R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability,
   and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies.
   Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile
   traits are `repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a
   shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability
   of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits
   are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control
   and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time
   (if present). (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal

   captivity and rely on the assumption that measures of traits in the
   laboratory reflect their expression in nature. We examined this rarely
   tested assumption by comparing laboratory and field measurements of the
   behaviour of wild field crickets (Gryllus campestris) by continuously
   monitoring individual behaviour in nature, and repeatedly capturing the
   same individuals and measuring their behaviour in captivity. We focused
   on three traits that are frequently examined in personality studies:
   shyness, activity and exploration. All of them showed repeatability in
   the laboratory. Laboratory activity and exploration predicted the
   expression of their equivalent behaviours in the wild, but shyness did
   not. Traits in the wild were predictably influenced by environmental
   factors such as temperature and sunlight, but only activity showed
   appreciable within-individual repeatability. This suggests that some
   behaviours typically studied as personality traits can be accurately
   assayed in captivity, but the expression of others may be highly
   context-specific. Our results highlight the importance of validating the
   relevance of laboratory behavioural assays to analogous traits measured
   in the wild.}},

Title = {{Context Matters: Multiple Novelty Tests Reveal Different Aspects of

Abstract = {{Animal personality research is receiving increasing interest from
   related fields, such as evolutionary personality psychology. By merging
   the conceptual understanding of personality, the contributions to both
   fields of research may be enhanced. In this study, we investigate animal
   personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying
   dispositional factors, which are not directly measurable, but which
   predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns.
   We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the
   consistency of inter-individual variation in behavioural responses
   towards novelty in 47 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were
   raised in identical housing conditions. Different stages of approach
   behaviour towards novelty, and how these related within and across
   contexts, were explored. Our experimental design contained four tests:
   two novel object tests (non-social contexts) and two novel animated
   stimuli tests (social contexts). Our results showed consistency in
   shyness measures across multiple tests, indicating the existence of
   personality in farmed American mink. It was found that consistency in
   shyness measures differs across non-social and social contexts, as well
   as across the various stages in the approach towards novel objects,
   revealing that different aspects of shyness exist in the farmed American
   mink. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the
   shyness-boldness continuum in the American mink. Since the mink were
   raised in identical housing conditions, inherited factors may have been
   important in shaping the consistent inter-individual variation. Body
   weight and sex had no effect on the personality of the mink. Altogether,
   our results suggest that the shyness-boldness continuum cannot be
   explained by a simple underlying dispositional factor, but instead
   encompasses a broader term of hesitating behaviour that might comprise
   several different personality traits.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Non-random mortality associated with commercial and recreational
   fisheries have the potential to cause evolutionary changes in fish
   populations. Inland recreational fisheries offer unique opportunities
   for the study of fisheries induced evolution due to the ability to
   replicate study systems, limited gene flow among populations, and the
   existence of unexploited reference populations. Experimental research
   has demonstrated that angling vulnerability is heritable in Largemouth
   Bass Micropterus salmoides, and is correlated with elevated resting
   metabolic rates (RMR) and higher fitness. However, whether such
   differences are present in wild populations is unclear. This study
   sought to quantify differences in RMR among replicated exploited and
   unexploited populations of Largemouth Bass. We collected age-0
   Largemouth Bass from two Connecticut drinking water reservoirs
   unexploited by anglers for almost a century, and two exploited lakes,
   then transported and reared them in the same pond. Field RMR of
   individuals from each population was quantified using intermittent-flow
   respirometry. Individuals from unexploited reservoirs had a
   significantly higher mean RMR (6\%) than individuals from exploited
   populations. These findings are consistent with expectations derived
   from artificial selection by angling on Largemouth Bass, suggesting that
   recreational angling may act as an evolutionary force influencing the
   metabolic rates of fishes in the wild. Reduced RMR as a result of
   fisheries induced evolution may have ecosystem level effects on energy
   demand, and be common in exploited recreational populations globally.}},

Title = {{Natal dispersal in a social landscape: Considering individual behavioral
   phenotypes and social environment in dispersal ecology}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{543-556}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natal dispersal, the movement of an organism from its birthplace to the
   site of first reproduction, is fundamental to many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. Mechanistically, individual dispersal decisions
   can depend on both individual phenotype and environmental cues. In
   particular, many established evolutionary theories of dispersal
   highlight the importance of the social environment. More recent research
   in behavioral ecology has focused on the importance of individual
   behavioral phenotypes. We reviewed the literature on individual
   behavioral phenotypes and dispersal and suggest that how individual
   behavioral phenotypes interact with the immediate social environment
   experienced by individuals in influencing dispersal is still poorly
   understood, despite growing interest. We found that very few studies had
   examined the interaction of individual behavioral phenotypes and social
   factors, and behavioral phenotypes related to social tendencies were
   less commonly measured than were behavioral phenotypes related to
   exploration or response to risk. Further, and unsurprisingly, studies on
   social behavioral phenotypes and dispersal behaviors during the
   transience stage of dispersal were underrepresented compared to the
   departure or settlement stages. Future studies in this area should aim
   to: a) make explicit links between behavioral traits and their proposed
   effects on dispersal decisions throughout multiple stages of dispersal,
   b) integrate more continuous dispersal variables, and c) consider the
   effects of the spatial distribution and phenotypes of conspecifics
   (i.e., the social landscape) encountered by individual dispersers.}},

   stress coping style}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{25-29}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Common carp that had been screened for stress coping style using a
   standard behavioural test (response to a novel environment) were given a
   learning task in which food was concealed in one of two compartments,
   its location randomised between trials and its presence in a given
   compartment signalled by either a red or a yellow light. All the fish
   learned to find food quickly, but did so in different ways. Fifty five
   percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder
   achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To
   explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping
   style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp
   classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow
   the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish
   that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials
   to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish. These results
   add to the growing body of information on within-species variation in
   learning strategies and suggest a possible influence of stress coping
   style on the use of associative learning as opposed to algorithmic
   searching during foraging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{181-190}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recently, carotenoid pigments have received considerable attention as
   modulators of animal health and performance. While studies show that
   elevated carotenoid intake and accumulation can influence activities
   like parental care and escape-flight performance, little is known of how
   carotenoid status influences the expression of animal personality
   traits, which can be energy-demanding and entail survival costs but also
   rewarding in the context of foraging and mating. We experimentally
   investigated the effects of carotenoid availability on exploratory
   behavior and activity level, using adult males and females of two
   species of waterfowl: mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and northern pintail
   (Anas acuta). We assessed behavior using a novel-environment test
   designed to measure an individual's response to novel objects and a
   potential predator threat (fox urine scent). We found that carotenoid
   availability was positively associated with some aspects of exploratory
   behavior: birds with higher concentrations of circulating carotenoids
   entered the test arena sooner and approached and entered
   predator-scented bedding material more frequently than birds with low
   carotenoid concentrations. These results suggest that the availability
   of carotenoid resources can influence personality traits in waterfowl,
   and we discuss putative physiological mechanisms underlying this effect.

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{74-88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a growth of interest in the consistent
   differences in individual behaviour over time and contexts constituting
   the so-called ``individual coping styles{''}. An understanding of this
   inter-individual variation is essential to improve our knowledge of the
   adaptive value of behaviour. Coping styles may have implications in
   diverse fields, so the development of appropriate screening methods for
   each species appears to be the most effective way to extend our
   knowledge and to incorporate behavioural responses into selection-based
   breeding programmes, to improve the domestication and welfare of farmed
   fish. We tested 30 juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at least
   twice in individual-based tests (feeding recovery in isolation,
   aggressiveness, exploration in a T-maze and net restraint) and
   group-based tests (risk-taking and hypoxia sorting), to assess coping
   style consistency in the short- and long-term and between tests. The
   results of individual-based tests were inconsistent over time and
   between tests in our setup: the time between repeat tests, learning and
   species-specific behavioural responses appeared to have a major impact.
   By contrast, the results of group-based tests, such as risk-taking and
   hypoxia sorting, appeared to be consistent (both in the short- and
   long-term). These tests therefore appeared to be the most relevant for
   the characterisation of coping style in European seabass. Furthermore,
   the results of these tests were also predictive of cortisol stress
   response. These tests are simple to perform and can be used to screen

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in clusters of behaviour (animal
   personalities) are being increasingly recognized by researchers of
   different disciplines, but studies on invertebrates are still scanty. In
   order to test for the presence of personality-like individual profiles
   we assessed the behavioural responsiveness of adult male cuttlefish
   temporarily kept in captivity and individually housed. We used three
   different stimulations, adapting a protocol established for octopuses
   (Mather and Anderson, 1993) to assess individual differences
   (personalities). In the ``alerting test{''} the behaviour was scored
   after the human observer lifted the cover of the tank. In the ``threat
   test{''} the behaviour was scored after the animal was touched with a
   stick. In the ``feeding test{''} the behaviour was scored after the
   animal was given a live prey. The relationship among behavioural
   responses was analysed by principal component analysis, which allowed
   identifying three dimensions along which individual differences were
   maximal, accounting for 39.6, 15.6, and 10.3\% of the total variance. We
   found marked individual differences that were consistent across the
   three tests with respect to behaviours such as floating, staying at the
   bottom of the tank, and moving the fins. However, behaviours such as
   ``moving{''} and ``changes in body patterning{''} showed
   context-dependent variation. This study provides evidence of personality
   dimensions in cuttlefish with implications about welfare of cephalopods
   used in research in view of the new EU regulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Knowledge continues to emerge on how maternally derived egg hormones
   influence progeny behaviour in oviparous taxa. Of particular interest is
   how glucocorticoids (GCs) in eggs, as a signal of maternal stress,
   affect offspring behavioural traits. To date, research has focused on
   effects of egg GCs on offspring behaviours within a single experimental
   context. Little is known regarding how egg GCs affect relationships
   among behaviours and across ecological contexts (i.e. behavioural
   syndromes). We explored how exogenously increased egg cortisol shapes
   behavioural syndromes of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch.
   Social dominance during a territory intrusion and boldness following a
   simulated predator attack were recorded for juvenile coho salmon reared
   from cortisol-treated and untreated eggs. When exposed to a conspecific
   intruder, coho salmon treated with cortisol in ovo increased dominance
   behaviours, whereas coho salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced these
   behaviours. Following exposure to a simulated predator attack, coho
   salmon reared from cortisol-treated eggs increased boldness (i.e.
   increased activity and feeding; reduced shelter use), whereas coho
   salmon reared from untreated eggs reduced boldness. A dominance-boldness
   relationship was observed for coho salmon reared from cortisol-treated,
   but not untreated, eggs; dominance during the territory intrusion
   positively correlated with boldness under threat of predation. Our
   results highlight the complex influence of egg GCs on offspring
   behaviour and behavioural syndromes. Continued investigation into the
   outcomes of egg GCs on offspring will broaden our understanding of
   intergenerational components of the hormone-behaviour nexus. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in both public information use, and
   the evolutionary origins and ecological consequences of animal
   personalities but surprisingly little integration of these two fields.
   Personality traits may impact upon the extent to which individuals
   respond to public information in a number of different ways. As a first
   step towards addressing some of these questions, in this study, we asked
   whether personality traits predicted public information use in ninespine
   sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). Over a 33-day period, subjects were
   scored twice for a number of behavioural traits, including measures of
   activity, exploration and shoaling tendency, and were exposed multiple
   times to a public information use foraging task, in which they were
   required to select the richer of two prey patches based upon the
   foraging success of two demonstrator groups. The repeatable (r =
   0.38-0.58) behavioural traits were reduced to two principle components
   describing space use and sociability. Neither of these was found to be
   related to either of two measures of public information use. While the
   personality traits that we considered did not co-vary with public
   information use in this species, they may well indirectly affect
   opportunity for exposure to public information, and this is an obvious
   avenue for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent over
   time or across context are termed behavioural types or personalities.
   Social spiders are an emerging model for studying animal personality in
   social systems and our study was motivated by the lack of work examining
   the persistence of personality in the long-term and under changed
   conditions. We examined consistency and plasticity in two key
   behaviours, prey capture and web maintenance, and tested for the
   presence of a behavioural syndrome between them in the social spider,
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum. Our experiments over a large part of the adult
   life span show that not all spiders capture prey, suggesting behavioural
   consistency with implications for task differentiation. Through prey
   manipulation experiments, we further probed the role of hunger,
   proximity to prey, body weight and number of days into the experiment on
   individual propensity to capture prey. Our results demonstrate that
   under altered prey availability, responses of individuals are plastic
   and influenced by hunger. These results suggest that behavioural
   consistency can be modulated significantly by extrinsic factors. In
   contrast, we did not find consistent differences between individuals in
   their participation during web maintenance. Additionally, we did not
   find a behavioural syndrome. Together, these results suggest a scenario
   of quasi-specialisation in which there is no strict partitioning of
   tasks. For the first time, our results demonstrate behavioural
   consistency over extended periods of time in social spiders and have
   implications for colony efficiency and survival. We argue that studies
   spanning ecologically relevant time periods and environmental variation
   can reveal the full extent of behavioural consistency and flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, considerable research interest in behavioral ecology
   has focused on characterizing and understanding individual differences
   in behavior that are consistent over time and across contexts, termed
   animal ``personalities,{''} and correlations between various behaviors
   across contexts, termed behavioral syndromes. Although there is some
   evidence that differences in personality among individuals within
   populations can be genetically based and adaptive, when and how
   individual personality differences emerge in a population is not well
   understood, but of considerable general interest. Here, using juveniles
   of the convict cichlid (Amatitlania siquia) as a model system, we
   investigated in the laboratory whether individuals consistently differ
   in their personalities and whether behavioral syndromes are apparent at
   an early developmental stage and, if so, whether distinct personality
   traits are heritable. Under standardized laboratory conditions and using
   sibling analysis, we quantified interindividual differences in their
   boldness behavior under potential predation threat and their exploratory
   activity in a novel environment, 2 ecologically important behaviors, as
   our focal personality traits and estimated their respective
   repeatability and heritability. We report for the first time consistent
   (repeatable) and heritable individual differences in boldness and
   exploratory behaviors, and a boldness-exploration behavioral syndrome,
   in young convict cichlids. Bolder fish were more exploratory than
   relatively timid ones. These results provide novel evidence for the
   emergence in early life history of consistent individual differences in
   personality traits and behavioral syndromes in this species and suggest
   that genetic variation for boldness and exploratory behaviors, and thus
   potential for selection on these traits, exists in our study population.}},

Abstract = {{The study of adaptive individual behavior ({''}animal personality{''})
   focuses on whether individuals differ consistently in (suites of
   correlated) behavior(s) and whether individual-level behavior is under
   selection. Evidence for selection acting on personality is biased toward
   species where behavioral and life-history information can readily be
   collected in the wild, such as ungulates and passerine birds. Here, we
   report estimates of repeatability and syndrome structure for behaviors
   that an insect (field cricket; Gryllus campestris) expresses in the
   wild. We used mark-recapture models to estimate personality-related
   survival and encounter probability and focused on a life-history phase
   where all individuals could readily be sampled (the nymphal stage). As
   proxies for risky behaviors, we assayed maximum distance from burrow,
   flight initiation distance, and emergence time after disturbance; all
   behaviors were repeatable, but there was no evidence for strong syndrome
   structure. Flight initiation distance alone predicted both daily
   survival and encounter probability: bolder individuals were more easily
   observed but had a shorter life span. Individuals were also somewhat
   repeatable in the habitat temperature under which they were assayed.
   Such environment repeatability can lead to upward biases in estimates of
   repeatability in behavior; this was not the case. Behavioral assays
   were, however, conducted around the subject's personal burrow, which
   could induce pseudorepeatability if burrow characteristics affected
   behavior. Follow-up translocation experiments allowed us to distinguish
   individual and burrow identity effects and provided conclusive evidence
   for individual repeatability of flight initiation distance. Our
   findings, therefore, forcefully demonstrate that personality variation
   exists in wild insects and that it is associated with components of
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality, i.e. stable individual differences in behaviour, is
   considered to be subject to evolutionary processes, as it has been shown
   to be heritable and to entail fitness consequences. Different hypotheses
   have been developed to explain why personality variation is maintained
   within populations, most likely via processes of balancing selection.
   One mechanism discussed is that combinations of similar personalities
   within breeding pairs could increase fitness. We investigated this
   purported mechanism by studying the association between personality
   combinations within nulliparous pairs and their onset of reproduction in
   a monogamous rodent, the mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus. In
   seasonal iteroparous breeders, reproductive timing is relevant to
   fitness, as a delayed onset of breeding potentially limits the number of
   breeding occasions and lowers the chance that offspring will start
   reproducing during the same season. Repeated standardized tests carried
   out prior to pairing revealed consistent individual differences in
   subjects' behavioural responses with respect to anxiety and exploratory
   activity, indicating the existence of personality types. Within-pair
   similarity in anxiety levels affected the chance of reproduction: pairs
   with similar anxiety scores had a higher probability of breeding, and
   were quicker to start, during the observation period, independently of
   the scores of both partners of the pair. We propose that this
   association between `personality matching' and the onset of reproduction
   could have important life history consequences in this species and might
   be one of the mechanisms leading to the maintenance of personality
   variation within populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

   Responses to Social Stimuli in a Lizard}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Hormones have been suggested as a key proximate mechanism that organize
   and maintain consistent individual differences in behavioural traits
   such as aggression. The steroid hormone testosterone in particular has
   an important activational role in mediating short-term aggressive
   responses to social and environmental stimuli within many vertebrate
   systems. We conducted two complementary experiments designed to
   investigate the activational relationship between testosterone and
   aggression in male Egernia whitii, a social lizard species. First, we
   investigated whether a conspecific aggressive challenge induced a
   testosterone response and second, we artificially manipulated
   testosterone concentrations to examine whether this changed aggression
   levels. We found that at the mean level, plasma T concentration did not
   appear to be influenced by an aggression challenge. However, there was a
   slight indication that receiving a challenge may influence
   intra-individual consistency of plasma T concentrations, with
   individuals not receiving an aggression challenge maintaining
   consistency in their circulating testosterone concentrations, while
   those individuals that received a challenge did not. Manipulating
   circulating testosterone concentrations had no influence on either
   mean-level or individual-level aggression. Combined with our previous
   work, our study adds increasing evidence that the relationship between
   testosterone and aggression is not straightforward, and promotes the
   investigation of alternative hormonal pathways and differences in
   neuro-synthesis and neuroendocrine pathways to account for species
   variable testosterone - aggression links.}},

Abstract = {{Diversity of animal personalities has been proposed to arise from
   differences in social attraction, and to enhance behavioural flexibility
   of a population. The present study evaluated gregariousness as a
   personality trait in 14 ewes kept on pasture. Gregariousness was defined
   based on the frequency of having a close neighbour (<3 m). Highly
   gregarious (HG) and less gregarious (LG) animals were separated into two
   groups (n = 7) which were reintegrated after 18 days. During direct
   field observations, behaviour was recorded individually every 15 min.
   Each session lasted 2.5 h (08.30-11.00 h or 1430-17.00 h, respectively).
   Behavioural synchronization was highest when the group consisted only of
   HG individuals (K-HG = 0.69, K-LG =0.31; t=5.29; p <0.001), indicating
   that gregariousness predicted behavioural synchronization in sheep.
   Though sheep are generally recognized as a highly gregarious species, HG
   and LG individuals could be differentiated clearly and consistently.
   Research on animal personality might help explain social influences on
   behavioural synchronization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of dispersal is important as it strongly
   influences population dynamics and evolution. However, context
   dependency of dispersal decisions, such as effects of social
   interactions and resource availability, is rarely disentangled from
   intrinsic factors, such as animal personality. Western bluebirds provide
   a unique opportunity to investigate the relative importance of intrinsic
   versus extrinsic factors in dispersal decisions because they display
   distinct aggressive personality types, have high recruitment of sons to
   the natal population, and depend on nest cavities, a resource that is
   easy to quantify. Here, we measured territorial interactions among kin
   and non-kin, resource availability, and aggressive behavior over an
   11-year period to determine how they influenced dispersal decisions of
   male offspring. We found that distance dispersed from kin was driven by
   a male's own aggression, the aggression of his nearest kin, and the
   resources available on the natal territory. Both aggressive males and
   males with aggressive kin dispersed longer distances, as did males who
   had fewer resources on their natal territories. Thus, dispersal in this
   species is influenced jointly by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
   Because resource acquisition and personality type are interdependent in
   this species, changes in the social environment are likely to have
   important consequences for population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{One explanation for animal personality is that different behavioural
   types derive from different life-history strategies. Highly productive
   individuals, with high growth rates and high fecundity, are assumed to
   live life at a fast pace showing high levels of boldness and risk
   taking, compared with less productive individuals. Here, we investigate
   among-individual differences in mean boldness (the inverse of the
   latency to recover from a startling stimulus) and in the consistency of
   boldness, in male hermit crabs in relation to two aspects of
   life-history investment. We assessed aerobic scope by measuring the
   concentration of the respiratory pigment haemocyanin, and we assessed
   fecundity by measuring spermatophore size. First, we found that
   individuals investing in large spermatophores also had high
   concentrations of haemocyanin. Using doubly hierarchical-generalized
   linear models to analyse longitudinal data on startle responses, we show
   that hermit crabs vary both in their mean response durations and in the
   consistency of their behaviour. Individual consistency was unrelated to
   haemocyanin concentration or spermatophore size, but mean startle
   response duration increased with spermatophore size. Thus, counter to
   expectations, it was the most risk-averse individuals, rather than the
   boldest and most risk prone, that were the most productive. We suggest
   that similar patterns should be present in other species, if the most
   productive individuals avoid risky behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Although personality has been documented in numerous animals and
   characters, research into personality-dependent spatial ecology has
   focused on dispersal. Indeed, few authors have investigated the role of
   other important spatial traits such as home range, movement distance,
   vertical activity, and site fidelity, and it is not clear whether these
   behaviors are correlated with dispersal. In this study, we investigated
   individual differences in home range, dispersal from release, vertical
   activity, movement distance, and site fidelity of 44 wild burbot Lota
   lota over 2 years, using an acoustic telemetry array and a Bayesian
   mixed modeling framework. We tested whether the spatial behaviors met
   the following criteria for personality-dependent behavior:
   repeatability, cross-contextual consistency, and an absence of
   pseudo-repeatability associated with spatial context choice. We then
   tested for between-individual correlations among spatial behaviors,
   indicative of a behavioral syndrome. Our results documented repeatable,
   cross-contextually consistent, personality-dependent home range,
   movement, dispersal from release, and site fidelity. In contrast,
   behavioral differences in vertical activity were inconsistent across
   sampling years and may have been a product of habitat heterogeneity. Our
   data indicate a spatial behavioral syndrome occurred independently from
   dispersal from release, with behavioral types ranging from
   ``resident{''} individuals with small home ranges, high site fidelity,
   and minimal movement to ``mobile{''} individuals with large home ranges,
   high movement rates, and little site fidelity. Our findings suggest
   animal personality can play a key role in shaping the space use of
   individuals, and this diversity in spatial behaviors may be too complex
   to be captured by often used simple linear measures of dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Personality and behavioral syndromes are of significant interest to a
   wide range of biological disciplines. Recent research using network
   analysis techniques has revealed widespread variation among individuals
   in sociability, which is a major axis of personality that creates the
   social microenvironment in which individuals express all other
   behaviors. We investigated the relationship between sociability and
   boldness, another fundamental personality axis, using a wild population
   of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) tested in their natural
   environment. We studied 2 dimensions of sociability (grouping behavior
   and association patterns). Over 2 years we found significant
   within-individual consistency and interindividual variation in the
   foraging group sizes of 171 females. Network analysis comparisons of 103
   females between the years, using HWIG (an association index that
   controls for gregariousness), showed that individuals were also highly
   consistent in their social network measures. We tested the boldness of
   51 of these females 6-21 times each over 18 months, using flight
   initiation distance tests; individuals were also highly consistent in
   this measure of personality. Shy females had significantly larger mean
   foraging group sizes. After controlling for gregariousness and space
   use, shy females had fewer preferred associates than bolder females.
   Therefore, boldness can have an important influence on the size and
   composition of foraging groups and thus social networks, in wild
   mammals.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{43-49}},

Abstract = {{Despite the potential benefits of modifying behaviour according to
   changing ecological conditions, many populations comprise individuals
   that differ consistently in behaviour across situations, contexts and
   points in time (i.e. individuals show personality). If personalities are
   adaptive, the balance between consistency and flexibility of behavioural
   traits should reflect the ability of individuals to detect and respond
   to changing conditions in an appropriate and timely manner and, thus,
   depend upon the pace and predictability of changing conditions. We
   investigated the balance between individual consistency and flexibility
   in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus by assaying boldness across
   the diel cycle and correlating these data with patterns of prey and
   threat abundance in the natural habitat. We found significant diel
   flexibility in boldness correlating with drastic and predictable changes
   in prey availability. Moreover, the strength of within-individual
   flexibility in boldness was comparable to the strength of rank-order
   consistency among individuals. We also found evidence that mean boldness
   level and among-individual variation in boldness are correlated with
   reproductive status. These data emphasize the interplay between
   behavioural consistency and flexibility and suggest that temporal
   characteristics of ecological conditions may be vital in assessing the
   strength, stability and adaptive value of animal personalities. (C) 2014

Title = {{Evidence for a mechanism of phenotypic integration of behaviour and
   innate immunity in a wild rodent: implications for animal personality
   and ecological immunology}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{179-189}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{If a single mechanism influences multiple traits, it may facilitate
   functional integration or impede optimal trait expression to produce
   consistent individual differences and correlations among those traits.
   The fields of animal personality and ecological immunology each aim to
   understand variation and covariation of behavioural and immune traits.
   Studying these traits together may provide additional insight into
   patterns of (co)variation than studying behaviours or immunity in
   isolation, as trade-offs between behaviour and immunity are likely.
   Hormonal mechanisms may be involved in the variation and covariation
   between behavioural and immune traits, and the role of receptors in
   particular has rarely been tested in wild animals. In wild-caught
   Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, we delivered
   mifepristone to experimentally block the actions of glucocorticoid
   receptors (GRs), a component of the stress response. Then we evaluated
   whether cortisol binding with GRs affects the plasticity of behavioural
   and immune traits, consistent individual differences and phenotypic
   integration of exploratory behaviour, activity, antipredator behaviour,
   response to restraint and bacteria-killing ability, a measure of innate
   immunity. Mifepristone treatment abolished relationships between faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite levels and both exploratory behaviour and
   bacteria-killing ability. This result indicates that cortisol binding
   with GRs is a mechanism of plasticity of those traits. Mifepristone also
   affected relationships among traits. Specifically, mifepristone
   treatment significantly modulated the relationships between
   bacteria-killing ability and two behaviours, exploration and activity.
   This result supports the hypothesis that the GR-cortisol binding is a
   mechanism of phenotypic integration. Together, these results suggest
   that GR-cortisol binding balances the often observed trade-off between
   behaviour and immunity to produce patterns of (co)variation of
   behavioural and immune traits seen in nature. (C) 2015 The Association

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences within (animal personality) and across
   (behavioural syndrome) behaviours became well recognized during the past
   decade. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the evolutionary and
   developmental mechanisms behind the phenomena is still incomplete. Here,
   we explored if risk-taking and exploration were consistent and linked to
   different ecologically relevant traits in wild-caught adult male
   European green lizards (Lacerta viridis) and in their 2-3 weeks old
   laboratory-reared offspring. Both adults and juveniles displayed animal
   personality, consistency being higher in juveniles. We found correlation
   between risk-taking and exploration (suggestive of a behavioural
   syndrome) only in adults. Juveniles were more explorative than adults.
   Large or ectoparasite-free adult males were more explorative than small
   or parasitized males. Juvenile females tended to be more risk-taking
   than males. Behaviour of fathers and their offspring did not correlate.
   We conclude that European green lizards show high behavioural
   consistency and age is an important determinant of its strength and
   links to traits likely affecting fitness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{174-182}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that individuals across a variety of taxa
   express consistent behavioural differences, or personality, which may
   affect reproductive success. Most previous studies of avian systems
   investigated the effects of individual personality on offspring
   recruitment and other fitness correlates, even in species with
   biparental care. Here we tested the potential for behavioural similarity
   within mated pairs of wild eastern bluebirds to impact reproductive
   success. Specifically, we quantified nest defence behaviour of males and
   females to address three hypotheses: (1) the individual personality
   hypothesis, which predicts that individuals with more aggressive
   personalities will have more nestlings survive to fledging; (2) the pair
   coordination hypothesis, which predicts similarly behaving pairs will
   have more nestlings survive to fledging; and (3) the pair intensity
   hypothesis, which predicts pairs with more aggressive personalities will
   have more nestlings survive to fledging. Pairs that had similar nest
   defence strategies produced more fledglings in support of the pair
   coordination hypothesis. We found no support for either the individual
   personality hypothesis or the pair intensity hypothesis. Thus,
   particularly in species with biparental care, it is important to
   consider the behaviour of both pair members to predict effects on
   reproductive success. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Applied personality assessment in domestic dogs: Limitations and caveats}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Modern behavioural tests for domestic dogs are commonly employed across
   a variety of fields, including the assessment of companion, assistance,
   working and sporting dogs. While there is increasing scientific
   attention on the development and evaluation of behavioural tests used to
   assess personality, a lack of robust assessment of the validity and
   reliability of many test protocols currently in use `on the ground' has
   led to the repeated questioning of their use by both the scientific
   community and the public. This is particularly prevalent within the
   welfare sector, where consequences for dogs that are identified as
   behaviourally unsuitable for rehoming are dire. Despite the large body
   of work dedicated to canine personality and behavioural test
   development, relatively few reported protocols have been demonstrated to
   accurately and reliably predict behavioural traits in dogs, according to
   accepted validation and reliability assessment protocols used by
   psychologists. Inconsistencies in the terminology used to describe
   behaviour, tests and canine personality are common within the literature
   pertaining to applied personality testing of dogs, making discussion of
   the usefulness of such tests within the applied environment difficult.
   Furthermore, highly relevant information gained from the fields of
   psychology and ethology, such as the limitations of behaviour-only
   scoring systems, the need to assess both temporal and contextual
   stability during personality testing, and the effects of arousal,
   impulsivity and affective state on behaviour, is seemingly overlooked by
   some test developers, resulting in array of test protocols that suffer
   from similar, predictable design limitations. This review discusses the
   most prominent considerations and limitations relevant to the assessment
   of personality through behavioural tests in domestic dogs, and suggests
   possible mechanisms through which these limitations may be investigated
   and addressed. In particular, it is recommended that the results of
   shelter-based behavioural test batteries are interpreted within the
   limitations of the context in which they are performed, and test
   developers consider other methods with which personality may be assessed
   within the shelter environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The function of a network is affected by its structure. For example, the
   presence of highly interactive individuals, or hubs, influences the
   extent and rate of information spread across a network. In a network of
   interactions, the duration over which individual variation in
   interactions persists may affect how the network operates. Individuals
   may persist in their behavior over time and across situations, often
   referred to as personality. Colonies of social insects are an example of
   a biological system in which the structure of the coordinated networks
   of interacting workers may greatly influence information flow within the
   colony, and therefore its collective behavior. Here I investigate the
   effects of persistence in walking patterns on interaction networks using
   computer simulations that are parameterized using observed behavior of
   harvester ants. I examine how the duration of persistence in spatial
   behavior influences network structure. Furthermore, I explore how
   spatial features of the environment affect the relationship between
   persistent behavior and network structure. I show that as persistence
   increases, the skewness of the weighted degree distribution of the
   interaction network increases. However, this relationship holds only
   when ants are confined in a space with boundaries, but not when physical
   barriers are absent. These findings suggest that the influence of animal
   personalities on network structure and function depends on the
   environment in which the animals reside}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality is considered to be subject to natural selection, and
   measuring its fitness consequences is an important step in the study of
   the evolution of this phenomenon. The evolutionary costs and benefits of
   certain personality traits are frequently assumed to fluctuate across
   different life history stages. However, little is still known about
   survival consequences of personality during juvenile life. We predicted
   survival costs of exploration tendency in juvenile European rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which we studied under quasi-natural
   conditions. In addition, consistencies between exploration and the
   animal's behavioral responses in other contexts were tested. Early
   exploratory behavior was assessed in two annual cohorts, either
   observationally by quantifying the time course of exploring the area
   around the nursery burrow shortly after emergence above ground or
   experimentally by conducting open-field tests shortly before emergence.
   In both years, the study revealed consistent results: more exploratory
   individuals had a lower chance of survival until the end of the
   vegetation period, presumably due to a higher predation risk. Fast
   explorers, as assessed by their exploration of the burrow environment,
   were also less sociable and tended to be more aggressive toward
   conspecifics as subadults. Sociability was repeatable across time.
   Furthermore, fast explorers, as assessed by their open-field behavior,
   were bolder in a handling test before emergence. These consistencies
   across context and time suggest the existence of personality. In
   conclusion, the results provide evidence for survival costs of fast
   exploration during juvenile life. The findings are in line with
   predictions on personality-related life history variation.}},

Abstract = {{Animals often exhibit consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and correlations between behaviors (i.e.,
   behavioral syndromes), yet the causes of those patterns of behavioral
   variation remain insufficiently understood. Many authors hypothesize
   that state-dependent behavior produces animal personality and behavioral
   syndromes. However, empirical studies assessing patterns of covariation
   among behavioral traits and state variables have produced mixed results.
   New statistical methods that partition correlations into
   between-individual and residual within-individual correlations offer an
   opportunity to more sufficiently quantify relationships among behaviors
   and state variables to assess hypotheses of animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes. In a population of wild Belding's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus beldingi), we repeatedly measured activity, exploration,
   and response to restraint behaviors alongside glucocorticoids and
   nutritional condition. We used multivariate mixed models to determine
   whether between-individual or within-individual correlations drive
   phenotypic relationships among traits. Squirrels had consistent
   individual differences for all five traits. At the between-individual
   level, activity and exploration were positively correlated whereas both
   traits negatively correlated with response to restraint, demonstrating a
   behavioral syndrome. At the within-individual level, condition
   negatively correlated with cortisol, activity, and exploration.
   Importantly, this indicates that although behavior is state-dependent,
   which may play a role in animal personality and behavioral syndromes,
   feedback mechanisms between condition and behavior appear not to produce
   consistent individual differences in behavior and correlations between
   them.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the fitness effects of animal personality by measuring
   activity and its relation to survival in the marine isopod Idotea

   personality trait, (2) whether this trait is connected to survival, and
   (3) whether personality and survival exhibit sex differences. We found
   that activity fulfilled the criteria of personality as individuals had
   consistent between-individual differences over time and across
   situations. Consistent individual differences in activity were
   associated with fitness as the survival probability of active
   individuals was lower, but this did not depend on sex. Our results
   demonstrate that personality exists in I. balthica and support recent
   suggestions that the association between personality and life-history
   traits is a central component in mediating animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have suggested that avian brood size is individually
   optimized. Yet, optimal reproductive decisions likely vary owing to
   among-individual differences in environmental sensitivity. Specifically,
   `proactive' individuals who do not track environmental changes may be
   less able to produce optimal brood sizes than `reactive' individuals who
   have more precise local environmental knowledge. To test this, we
   quantified exploratory behaviour (a proxy for proactivity) in a great
   tit (Parus major) population, manipulated brood sizes (reduced, control,
   enlarged) and evaluated whether individuals of dissimilar coping style
   differed in their level of optimization. If reactive females behaved
   optimally, any deviation from their original brood size should lower
   fitness, whereas this should not be the case for proactive females.
   Reactive females indeed performed best at their natural brood size,
   whereas proactive females performed best when raising an enlarged brood.
   These findings imply that proactive females produced sub-optimal brood
   sizes. We speculate that proactive females might (i) take decisions
   based on biased perception of their environment, (ii) face energetic
   constraints in offspring production and/or (iii) be more willing to
   invest into current reproduction when given the option. Our findings
   provide experimental evidence for coping style-related differences in
   optimal reproductive decisions and life-history strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies are increasingly demonstrating that individuals differ in their
   rate of ageing, and this is postulated to emerge from a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction. Recent theory predicts a
   correlation between individual personality and life-history strategy,
   and from this comes the prediction that personality may predict the
   intensity of senescence. Here we show that boldness correlates with
   reproductive success and foraging behaviour in wandering albatrosses,
   with strong sex-specific differences. Shy males show a strong decline in
   reproductive performance with age, and bold females have lower
   reproductive success in later adulthood. In both sexes, bolder birds
   have longer foraging trips and gain more mass per trip as they get
   older. However, the benefit of this behaviour appears to differ between
   the sexes, such that it is only matched by high reproductive success in
   males. Together our results suggest that personality linked foraging
   adaptations with age are strongly sex-specific in their fitness benefits
   and that the impact of boldness on senescence is linked to ecological
   parameters.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},
Number = {{1798}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Individual animals frequently exhibit repeatable differences from other
   members of their population, differences now commonly referred to as
   `animal personality'. Personality differences can arise, for example,
   from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental
   and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic
   variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of
   behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and
   additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation
   in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect
   different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is
   possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when
   heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution
   of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated
   whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same
   data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that
   approximately 52\% of animal personality variation was attributable to
   additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is
   often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher.
   Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are
   likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and
   (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn
   from repeatability estimates may often be justified.}},

Abstract = {{Both juvenile and adult animals display stable behavioural differences
   (personality), but lifestyles and niches may change as animals mature,
   raising the question of whether personality changes across ontogeny.
   Here, we use a wild population of red squirrels to examine changes in
   activity and aggression from juvenile to yearling life stages.
   Personality may change at the individual level (individual stability),
   population level (mean level stability), and relative to other
   individuals (differential stability). We calculated all three types of
   stability, as well as the structural stability of the
   activity-aggression behavioural syndrome. Within individuals, both
   activity and aggression scores regressed towards the mean. Differential
   stability was maintained for activity, but not aggression. Structural
   stability was maintained; however, the activity-aggression correlation
   increased in squirrels that gained territories later in the season.
   These results suggest that personality undergoes some changes as animals
   mature, and that the ontogeny of personality can be linked to
   environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many investigations into consistent, individual
   differences in behavior (animal personalities), but rather less
   attention has been given to the possibility that individuals might
   differ consistently in their ``cognitive style,{''} which refers to the
   way information is acquired, processed, stored, or acted on. Both
   personality and cognition have important fitness consequences, and it
   has been proposed that variation in cognition could be functionally
   related to variation in personality. Here, we test this hypothesis using
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model and adopt
   a classic T-maze with food reward experimental paradigm. We first
   confirmed that fish choose the correct arm of the maze significantly
   more than would be expected by chance and that this improves with trial
   number. We then explored predictors of individual differences in the
   speed (time to making a decision) and accuracy (whether the first
   decision is correct) in decision making. We find bolder behavioral types
   (who tend to be male) arrive at the correct decision sooner than their
   shyer conspecifics. However, boldness was not related to decision
   accuracy. Moreover, we did not find any significant difference in fish's
   improvement in decision accuracy over successive trials according to
   boldness or sex. This suggests that although bolder fish may acquire
   information more quickly because they make decisions faster, they do not
   differ from shyer conspecifics in their decision-making accuracy. The
   absence of such a trade-off might offer a functional explanation for
   why, in stickleback fish and many other species, bolder individuals tend
   to initiate movement and shyer individuals to follow-bold leaders may
   result in faster group decisions without compromising accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The maternal environment exerts important influences on offspring
   mass/growth, metabolism, reproduction, neurobiology, immune function,
   and behavior among birds, insects, reptiles, fish, and mammals. For
   mammals, mother's milk is an important physiological pathway for
   nutrient transfer and glucocorticoid signaling that potentially
   influences offspring growth and behavioral phenotype. Glucocorticoids in
   mother's milk have been associated with offspring behavioral phenotype
   in several mammals, but studies have been handicapped by not
   simultaneously evaluating milk energy density and yield. This is
   problematic as milk glucocorticoids and nutrients likely have
   simultaneous effects on offspring phenotype. We investigated mother's
   milk and infant temperament and growth in a cohort of rhesus macaque
   (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant dyads at the California National Primate
   Research Center (N = 108). Glucocorticoids in mother's milk, independent
   of available milk energy, predicted a more Nervous, less Confident
   temperament in both sons and daughters. We additionally found sex
   differences in the windows of sensitivity and the magnitude of
   sensitivity to maternal-origin glucocorticoids. Lower parity mothers
   produced milk with higher cortisol concentrations. Lastly, higher
   cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant
   weight gain across time. Taken together, these results suggest that
   mothers with fewer somatic resources, even in captivity, may be
   ``programming{''} through cortisol signaling, behaviorally cautious
   offspring that prioritize growth. Glucocorticoids ingested through milk
   may importantly contribute to the assimilation of available milk energy,
   development of temperament, and orchestrate, in part, the allocation of
   maternal milk energy between growth and behavioral phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent increase in interest in personality in dogs, behavioral
   assays of their behavior have proliferated. There has been particularly
   strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a
   result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in
   puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide
   as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality
   dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we
   used an `expert-categorization' procedure a standardized method often
   used in the course of meta-analyses to identify the subset of those
   assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions
   effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests
   and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine
   personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity,
   aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration,
   fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness,
   trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay
   subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a
   standardized categorization procedure undertaken.independently by six
   expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged
   to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a
   widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test
   batteries. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Canine

Abstract = {{Male expected reproductive success can be enhanced by increased mating
   success (mate number) or, when females can mate multiply, by increased
   mating exclusivity (i.e., reduced partner promiscuity). A positive or
   negative covariance between these two mating outcomes could
   substantially increase or decrease overall variation in male expected
   reproductive success, yet the relationship between these mating outcomes
   is relatively understudied. We examined this relationship and the
   influence of male personality traits, female personality traits, and the
   social environment on mating outcomes in stream water striders, Aquarius
   remigis, at two experimental sex ratios: equal and 2:1 male-biased. To
   our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify this full set of
   effects. We found that mating frequency (mating success) and mating
   exclusivity were positively correlated in the male-biased treatment, but
   were not related at equal sex ratios. At both sex ratios, males that
   were more active and aggressive had both higher mating frequency and
   higher mating exclusivity. A male's effective mating (the product of
   mating frequency and mating exclusivity) was also higher if on average
   he mated with females that tended to hide in refuges (and were
   presumably less available for future matings). Finally, males that were
   more often in pools with extremely aggressive ({''}hyperaggressive{''})
   males actually had increased mating exclusivity, potentially because
   hyperaggression reduced average female promiscuity. This study
   highlights the importance of considering mating outcomes beyond mating
   success and examining the simultaneous contribution of male behaviours,
   female behaviours and social factors to mating dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Social animals must time and coordinate their behaviour to ensure the
   benefits of grouping, resulting in collective movements and the
   potential emergence of leaders and followers. However, individuals often
   differ consistently from one another in how they cope with their
   environment, a phenomenon known as animal personality, which may affect
   how individuals use coordination rules and requiring them to compromise.
   Here we tracked the movements of pairs of three-spined sticklebacks,
   Gasterosteus aculeatus, separated by a transparent partition that
   allowed them to observe and interact with one another in a context
   containing cover. Individuals differed consistently in their tendency to
   approach their partner's compartment during collective movements. The
   strength of this social attraction was positively correlated with the
   behavioural coordination between members of a pair but was negatively
   correlated with an individual's tendency to lead. Social attraction may
   form part of a broader behavioural syndrome as it was predicted by the
   boldness of an individual, measured in isolation prior to the
   observation of pairs, and by the boldness of the partner. We found that
   bolder fish, and those paired with bolder partners, tended to approach
   their partner's compartment less closely. These findings provide
   important insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and
   functioning of social groups and the emergence and maintenance of
   consistent behavioural differences. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published on

Abstract = {{The recent growth of research on animal personality could provide new
   insights into our understanding of sociality and the structure of animal
   groups. Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal
   personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in
   some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it
   clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict
   behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of
   a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and
   performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals:
   tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a
   variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger
   individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness
   were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related
   to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to
   capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and
   we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results,
   such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups
   rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species
   being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality
   assays that test individuals alone.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms can respond to and cope with stressful environments in a
   number of ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological
   adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal
   adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying)
   activity, flight performance and morphology of three European
   populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from
   different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign
   and stressful high temperatures. Spanish flies showed greater heat
   resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high
   temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the
   shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight
   performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further
   (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor
   activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able
   to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population
   differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained
   using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden
   setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high
   temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective
   agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the
   populations. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour are often consistent across time and
   contexts, but it is not clear whether such consistency is reflected at
   the molecular level. We explored this issue by studying scouting in
   honeybees in two different behavioural and ecological contexts: finding
   new sources of floral food resources and finding a new nest site. Brain
   gene expression profiles in food-source and nest-site scouts showed a
   significant overlap, despite large expression differences associated
   with the two different contexts. Class prediction and `leave-one-out'
   cross-validation analyses revealed that a bee's role as a scout in
   either context could be predicted with 92.5\% success using 89 genes at
   minimum. We also found that genes related to four neurotransmitter
   systems were part of a shared brain molecular signature in both types of
   scouts, and the two types of scouts were more similar for genes related
   to glutamate and GABA than catecholamine or acetylcholine signalling.
   These results indicate that consistent behavioural tendencies across
   different ecological contexts involve a mixture of similarities and
   differences in brain gene expression.}},

Volume = {{161}},

Abstract = {{Most studies carried out with seabass under self-feeding conditions
   report an intriguing social structure that is built around the device
   and the food dispenser with three coexisting triggering categories:
   high-triggering (HT), low-triggering(LT) and zero-triggering (ZT) fish.
   However, neither sex nor feeding motivation or hierarchy can explain the
   establishment of this specialization. We characterized the personality
   of seabass with the commonly used restraint and open field tests and
   assessed the link between personality traits and individual triggering
   activity towards the self-feeder apparatus. We found no differences
   between triggering categories during the restraint test but high
   triggering fish were characterized as shyer than low-and zero-triggering
   fish during the open field test. Triggering activity was negatively
   correlated with exploratory capacities and boldness. This experiment
   provides for the first time evidence that high triggering status in
   seabass is correlated with personality traits, which could partly
   explain the social structure that builds around a self-feeder device.

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, there has been growing interest among behavioral
   ecologists in exploring animal personalities. However, while the
   foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only
   little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the
   personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability
   and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of
   foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance
   and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal
   conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much
   stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality.
   Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of
   sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in
   substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling
   insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic
   alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals
   indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that
   repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy
   expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy
   expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how
   differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of
   plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in animal personalities has generated a burgeoning literature
   on repeatability in individual traits such as boldness or exploration
   through time or across different contexts. Yet, repeatability can be
   influenced by the interactive social strategies of individuals, for
   example, consistent inter-individual variation in aggression is well
   documented. Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of
   repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic
   pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a
   heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is
   repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level
   remains unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of
   consistent and repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species
   of shark, a taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet
   to be described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten
   independent shark groups across different habitats, testing
   repeatability in individual network position under changing
   environments. To understand better the mechanisms behind repeatable
   social behaviour, we also explored the coupling between individual
   preferences for specific group sizes and social network position. We
   quantify repeatability in sharks by demonstrating that despite changes
   in aggregation measured at the group level, the social network position
   of individuals is consistent across treatments. Group size preferences
   were found to influence the social network position of individuals in
   small groups but less so for larger groups suggesting network structure,
   and thus, repeatability was driven by social preference over aggregation
   tendency.}},

Abstract = {{Highly plastic endocrine traits are thought to play a central role in
   allowing organisms to respond rapidly to environmental change. Yet, not
   all individuals display the same degree of plasticity in these traits,
   and the costs of this individual variation in plasticity are unknown. We
   studied individual differences in corticosterone levels under varying
   conditions to test whether there are consistent individual differences
   in (1) baseline corticosterone levels; (2) plasticity in the hormonal
   response to an ecologically relevant stressor (food restriction); and
   (3) whether individual differences in plasticity are related to fitness
   costs, as estimated by oxidative stress levels. We took 25 wild-caught
   house sparrows into captivity and assigned them to repeated food
   restricted and control treatments (60\% and 110\% of their daily food
   intake), such that each individual experienced both food restricted and
   control diets twice. We found significant individual variation in
   baseline corticosterone levels and stress responsiveness, even after
   controlling for changes in body mass. However, these individual
   differences in hormonal responsiveness were not related to measures of
   oxidative stress. These results have implications for how corticosterone
   levels may evolve in natural populations and raise questions about what
   we can conclude from phenotypic correlations between hormone levels and
   fitness measures.}},

Title = {{Individual Variation in Cone Photoreceptor Density in House Sparrows:
   Implications for Between-Individual Differences in Visual Resolution and
   Chromatic Contrast}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Between-individual variation has been documented in a wide variety of
   taxa, especially for behavioral characteristics; however,
   intra-population variation in sensory systems has not received similar
   attention in wild animals. We measured a key trait of the visual system,
   the density of retinal cone photoreceptors, in a wild population of
   house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We tested whether individuals
   differed from each other in cone densities given within-individual
   variation across the retina and across eyes. We further tested whether
   the existing variation could lead to individual differences in two
   aspects of perception: visual resolution and chromatic contrast. We
   found consistent between-individual variation in the densities of all
   five types of avian cones, involved in chromatic and achromatic vision.
   Using perceptual modeling, we found that this degree of variation
   translated into significant between-individual differences in visual
   resolution and the chromatic contrast of a plumage signal that has been
   associated with mate choice and agonistic interactions. However, there
   was no evidence for a relationship between individual visual resolution
   and chromatic contrast. The implication is that some birds may have the
   sensory potential to perform ``better{''} in certain visual tasks, but
   not necessarily in both resolution and contrast simultaneously. Overall,
   our findings (a) highlight the need to consider multiple individuals
   when characterizing sensory traits of a species, and (b) provide some
   mechanistic basis for between-individual variation in different
   behaviors (i.e., animal personalities) and for testing the predictions
   of several widely accepted hypotheses (e.g., honest signaling).}},

Abstract = {{Only recently, variability within individuals has become of importance
   to evolutionary thinking. The boom in the literature on behavioural
   variability has led to the emergence of concepts such as behavioural
   plasticity, stereotypy, imprecision, and intra-individual variability
   (IIV). The proliferation of new terms has resulted in overlapping
   concepts, spreading confusion in understanding the origins of
   variability. Here we provide a critical overview of the concepts related
   to behavioural variability within the individual. We conclude that
   although there is no overlapping between behavioural plasticity and IIV,
   these concepts do overlap with stereotypy; they also face problems with
   ideas of abnormality and absence of function in stereotyped behaviour.
   We further provide a critical overview of the sometimes confusing
   relationship between (1) within individual variability, and (2)
   consistent variability across individuals (personality). We point out
   that personality is logically independent of both activational
   plasticity and IIV, because personality emerges at the population level,
   whereas plasticity and IIV emerge at the individual level. We conclude
   that, in personality studies, the failure to acknowledge the existence
   of either internal variability or consistent between-individual
   differences in internal variability will result in mixing different
   phenomena, and inhibit building unified accounts from heterogeneous
   databases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Individual differences in personality and behavioural plasticity
   facilitate division of labour in social spider colonies}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{177-183}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Among factors hypothesized to favour consistent individual differences
   in behaviour (i.e. personality or behavioural types), the social
   environment has received relatively little attention. Within-group
   variation in personality may facilitate the emergence of division of
   labour, if individuals with different personalities tend to specialize
   on different tasks. In turn, functional benefits derived from division
   of labour may promote the coexistence of alternative behavioural types.
   We investigated how intracolonial variation in personality influences
   individual and collective patterns of task performance in the social
   spider Anelosimus studiosus. Colonies composed of a mixture of
   aggressive and docile females showed greater nonreproductive division of
   labour than monotypic colonies of either behavioural type. Within
   mixed-personality colonies, aggressive individuals tended to perform
   more prey capture, colony defence and/or web repair, while docile
   individuals became brood care specialists. Task differentiation was
   shaped by social dynamics, but behavioural plasticity varied with
   personality type: docile individuals were more socially responsive,
   shifting their task allocation in the presence of aggressive
   colonymates. Efficiency gains from personality-linked division of labour
   may help to explain the superior performance of diverse colonies and to
   maintain individual behavioural variation in A. studiosus and other
   social species. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The relationship between stress and personality has often been studied
   using captive animals in a laboratory context, yet less often in wild
   populations. Wild populations, however, may reveal aspects of the
   personality-stress relationship that laboratory-based studies cannot.
   Here, we assessed the personality and stress hormone response of adult
   females within a free-living population of Richardson's ground squirrels
   (Urocitellus richardsonii). Personality was assessed by quantifying
   individual responses to a novel object, and physiological stress was
   measured from faecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Principal component and
   principal component regression analyses were performed to determine
   whether the behavioural and endocrine measures were related. Based on
   these analyses, shyness-boldness was found to best predict
   glucocorticoid levels, in that individuals expressing the greatest
   vigilance in response to the novel object also had the highest measured
   concentrations of faecal glucocorticoids. Exploration, however, was
   independent of measured glucocorticoid levels, consistent with a
   multidimensional interpretation of non-human animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral ecologists are increasingly interested in patterns of

   regards to what the ecological significance of particular behavioral
   responses might be and whether different methodologies in fact test the
   same behavior. Here, using house crickets (Acheta domesticus), we tested
   whether stereotypical approaches to quantifying repeatable variation in
   exploratory behavior measured the same behaviors. We found that house
   cricket exploratory behavior was highly repeatable in two populations
   (repeatability: 0.37-0.51). However, exploratory behavior across two
   different testing methods was not strongly correlated (r = -0.17 to
   0.14). This suggests that either different behaviors or distinct
   components of exploratory behavior were being measured. Our results also
   support recent criticisms that care needs to be taken in describing

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in animal behaviour is nearly ubiquitous
   and has important ecological and evolutionary implications.
   Additionally, suites of behavioural traits are often correlated, forming
   behavioural syndromes in both humans and other species. Such syndromes
   are often described by testing for variation in traits across commonly
   described dimensions (e. g. aggression and neophobia), independent of
   whether this variation is ecologically relevant to the focal species.
   Here, we use a variety of ecologically relevant behavioural traits to
   test for a colony-level behavioural syndrome in rock ants (Temnothorax
   rugatulus). Specifically, we combine field and laboratory assays to
   measure foraging effort, how colonies respond to different types of
   resources, activity level, response to threat and aggression level. We
   find evidence for a colony level syndrome that suggests colonies
   consistently differ in coping style-some are more risk-prone, whereas
   others are more risk-averse. Additionally, by collecting data across the
   North American range of this species, we show that environmental
   variation may affect how different populations maintain consistent
   variation in colony behaviour.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{150-157}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The existence of animal personality is well-established across a wide
   range of species, with the majority of evidence for this being obtained
   from individuals held in captivity. However, there has been little work
   assessing the influence of commonly-measured personality traits on
   fitness, which is pertinent when the genetic basis of personality is
   considered. We measured whether the reproductive behaviour and success
   of zebra finches in a captive mixed-sex aviary environment was
   influenced by an aspect of their personality, their exploratory
   behaviour in a single-sex social aviary. We found that more exploratory
   males made a greater number of breeding attempts and raised more
   nestlings than less exploratory males. These results were not confounded
   by extra-pair paternity, which was not related to personality, or by the
   individuals that did not initiate any reproductive attempts at all. Our
   work provides evidence that attributes of personality may influence the
   degree to which individuals cope with, and thrive in a captive
   environment and this should be accounted for in both experimental design
   and the interpretation of results. Furthermore, this suggests that there
   may be selection on these traits as part of the domestication process.

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in behavior have been
   demonstrated in an array of species from diverse taxa, and variation in
   boldness may be associated with variation in aggressiveness. However,
   little is known about how boldness is linked with the ability to win
   fights (resource holding potential) or about how the experience of
   fighting may alter subsequent boldness. Animal contests often involve
   role asymmetries, where the 2 opponents fight in different ways. Here,
   we investigate boldness before and after fighting in attacking and
   defending hermit crabs during contests over the ownership of gastropod
   shells. Although prefight boldness did not influence the chance of
   winning for attackers, successful defenders had longer startle responses
   (less bold) than those that gave up. Postfight changes in boldness also
   differed between roles. For defenders, there was a significant decline
   in consistency of startle responses after fighting, coupled with
   outcome-dependent plasticity in mean boldness. Furthermore, postfight
   boldness in defenders varied with the intensity of agonistic behavior
   inflicted on them by attackers. In contrast, boldness in attackers was
   stable across the before-and after-fighting situations. Links between
   internal state and agonistic behavior are known to vary between roles in

Abstract = {{Courtship signals are expected to be consistent within but vary between
   males of different qualities. Such traits are, therefore, predicted to
   exhibit high repeatability. However, studies have shown that courtship
   behaviors vary greatly in their within-individual repeatability,
   resulting in substantial variation in their ability to reflect male
   quality. This has implications for the evolution of female mate choice
   and courtship communication, as low levels of repeatability may reflect
   courtship signals that do not provide accurate quality information to
   females. In this article, we tested whether male courtship shuddering in
   the tropical orb-web spider, Argiope radon, influences female mate
   choice. We also tested whether male shudder performance reflects male
   phenotypic condition and is repeatable. We found that male shudder
   performance and condition predicted female latency to move onto the
   mating thread, a measure of mate preference. Aspects of male shudder
   performance were positively correlated with male body condition.
   Further, we found surprisingly high levels of repeatability in male
   courtship shuddering, ranking among the highest levels recorded to date
   for courtship behavior. We suggest that male courtship shuddering
   functions as an important indicator of male quality, with strong
   potential to respond to selection.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{9-17}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relative importance of individual differences in
   personality (activity and aggressiveness), social skill and the social
   environment (average activity and aggressiveness of the group, presence
   of hyperaggressive males) in determining the behaviour and mating
   success of males of the stream water strider, Aquarius remigis. Males
   that had a consistently more active-aggressive behavioural type had, on
   average, higher mating success largely because they spent more time
   active in microhabitats associated with acquiring mates. Some
   active-aggressive males, however, showed hyperaggressive behaviour,
   apparently attempting to mate forcibly with other males, or forcibly
   separate pairs, which was rarely successful. A higher tendency to be
   hyperaggressive was associated with reduced mating success (i.e. being
   hyperaggressive represents low social skill). The overall effect was
   thus stabilizing sexual selection on male activity and aggression. The
   social environment also had large effects on male behaviour and mating
   success. In particular, the presence of a keystone hyperaggressive male
   had strong negative effects on the mating success and general activity
   of other males in the pool. Notably, males with a more active-aggressive
   behavioural type maintained higher mating success than less
   active-aggressive males in the presence of a hyperaggressive male.
   Social plasticity (change in behaviour in response to changing social
   conditions) also depended on the male's behavioural type; males with a
   more active-aggressive behavioural type were more plastic. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are by definition stable over time, but to what
   extent they may change during development and in adulthood to adjust to
   environmental change is unclear. Animals of temperate environments have
   evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the
   cyclic seasonal changes. This may also result in changes in personality:
   suites of behavioural and physiological traits that vary consistently
   among individuals. Winter, typically the adverse season challenging
   survival, may require individuals to have shy/cautious personality,
   whereas during summer, energetically favourable to reproduction,
   individuals may benefit from a bold/risk-taking personality. To test the
   effects of seasonal changes in early life and in adulthood on behaviours
   (activity, exploration and anxiety), body mass and stress response, we
   manipulated the photoperiod and quality of food in two experiments to
   simulate the conditions of winter and summer. We used the common voles
   (Microtus arvalis) as they have been shown to display personality based
   on behavioural consistency over time and contexts. Summer-born voles
   allocated to winter conditions at weaning had lower body mass, a higher
   corticosterone increase after stress and a less active, more cautious
   behavioural phenotype in adulthood compared to voles born in and
   allocated to summer conditions. In contrast, adult females only showed
   plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone levels, which were higher in
   the animals that were transferred to the winter conditions than to those
   staying in summer conditions. These results suggest a sensitive period
   for season-related behavioural plasticity in which juveniles shift over
   the bold-shy axis.}},

Abstract = {{The presence or absence of social counterparts can be instrumental in
   shaping both individual and collective behaviors. Furthermore, factors
   of the social environment may safeguard individuals from environmental
   stressors. In the study reported here, we tested the effects of moving
   into a new habitat on the mean, variance, and repeatability of
   individual behavioral tendencies between two social contexts (isolated
   vs. in a social group). Using the arid social spider, Stegodyphus
   dumicola (Araneae: Eresidae), we tested whether individuals' boldness
   was influenced by either (i) their time spent in a social group or (ii)
   their latency since having moved into a new habitat. We found that the
   effect of moving into a new habitat on individuals' boldness depended on
   whether spiders entered the novel environment in isolation or as part of
   a social group. Spiders that experienced a habitat shift with a social
   group showed no change in their average boldness, whereas individuals
   that shifted environments in isolation showed an increase in their mean
   boldness. Interestingly, neither of these trends was influenced by the
   time which had elapsed since the habitat shift, suggesting that shifting
   habitats has a lasting effect on isolated spiders' behavioral
   tendencies. Finally, we assessed how time spent in a new environment
   influenced colonies' collective foraging behavior. Here, we found that
   the longer social groups remained in a new environment, the faster the
   group responded to prey. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the
   effects of shifting physical environments on individuals' boldness may
   depend on individuals' social context, and that group tenure is
   associated with subtle shifts in colonies' collective foraging behavior.}},

Title = {{Personality Predicts Social Dominance in Male Domestic Fowl}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Individuals in social species commonly form dominance relationships,
   where dominant individuals enjoy greater access to resources compared to
   subordinates. A range of factors such as sex, age, body size and prior
   experiences has to varying degrees been observed to affect the social
   status an individual obtains. Recent work on animal personality (i.e.
   consistent variation in behavioural responses of individuals)
   demonstrates that personality can co-vary with social status, suggesting
   that also behavioural variation can play an important role in
   establishment of status. We investigated whether personality could
   predict the outcome of duels between pairs of morphologically matched
   male domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a species where
   individuals readily form social hierarchies. We found that males that
   more quickly explored a novel arena, or remained vigilant for a longer
   period following the playback of a warning call were more likely to
   obtain a dominant position. These traits were uncorrelated to each other
   and were also uncorrelated to aggression during the initial part of the
   dominance-determining duel. Our results indicate that several
   behavioural traits independently play a role in the establishment of
   social status, which in turn can have implications for the reproductive
   success of different personality types.}},

Abstract = {{Mate choice is known as an important behavior allowing females to choose
   the best mate to increase their reproductive success. To estimate male
   quality, females can use multiple traits. Among those, recent studies
   have shown that male personality traits could play an important role in
   mate choice as they are often linked to major life-history traits and
   can be heritable. However, because the relationships between
   life-history traits and personality traits are context dependent,
   females are expected to choose male personality types according to the
   mating context. In this study on common lizards (Zootoca vivipara), we
   examined the role of personality traits in female mate choice and mating
   behavior after experimentally manipulating the predation risk
   experienced by females prior to mating. We showed that females not
   exposed to predator cues preferred males with high-activity level, a
   heritable behavior. When females are exposed to predator cues prior to
   mating, this preference was reversed. High-activity levels generally
   increase competitive abilities and survival but could be detrimental
   when predators are present. Our results suggest that female common
   lizards choose males based on their personality types and can modify
   their preferences according to their environmental context in order to
   produce offspring that are better adapted to their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Different behavioral traits often covary, forming a behavioral syndrome.
   It is poorly known whether this covariance occurs on the
   between-individual level and what its selective consequences are. We
   used repeated measures (N = 562 observation events) of individual tawny

   seasonal timing of reproduction and clutch size on boldness displayed
   during defense of their clutch, in relation to plumage coloration,
   including local recruit production as a selective force on these traits.
   Using a Bayesian multivariate mixed model, we quantified the covariances
   between these traits on phenotypic, residual, and between-individual
   level and used a structural equation modeling approach to test the
   significance of presumed causal relationship between these traits in an
   a priori hypothesized path. On the phenotypic level, boldness was
   determined through early timing of breeding and larger clutch size, and
   early breeding increased recruitment probability. However, this
   relationship was entirely due to residual covariances and was not
   present on the between-individual level. The low individual-level
   correlations did not constrain the capacity of the population to respond
   to evolution as quantified by average autonomy (a metric summarizing
   evolutionary constraint on multiple traits). In the tawny owl, the
   association between early breeding and bold behavior, which is favored
   by selection, is solely due to extrinsic, nonheritable factors. We
   conclude that phenotypic evidence is insufficient to demonstrate
   syndrome covariance.}},

Abstract = {{Canine personality is of keen interest to dog owners and researchers
   alike. The regular human contact with them makes dogs an ideal species
   to use in the investigation of animal personality. This study
   specifically focused on Labrador Retrievers, consistently one of the
   most popular breeds both in the UK and around the world. Using surveys
   completed by dog owners, data was gathered on the behaviour of the dogs,
   in addition to the physical characteristics and management
   characteristics of the dogs (n = 1978). Twelve personality traits were
   identified and investigated for associations with the demographic data.
   It was found that the working status of the dog was more commonly
   associated with differences in personality than other analyzed factors.
   Gundogs had higher scores for `fetching tendency' and `trainability'
   than Showdogs or Pets (P < 0.05). Chocolate dogs were more `agitated
   when ignored' and showed more `excitability' than black dogs, and lower
   `trainability' and `noise fear' than both yellow and black dogs (all P <
   0.05). Dogs exercised for longer periods showed less aggression, less
   fear of humans and objects and lower separation anxiety than dogs that
   were not as active. The effects observed in this study may be due to the
   experience and training of the dogs, the work-related genetic strain of
   Labrador Retriever or most likely, a combination of both influences. (C)

Abstract = {{The emergence of an animal's personality is the result of interactions
   between genetics, environment and experience. It is known that
   individuals are able to modulate their behaviour according to the
   context or the social environment. Many studies have shown for example,
   that familiarity among conspecifics diminishes aggressiveness, although
   little is known about the underlying processes. Nevertheless,
   personality traits have long been determined while ignoring the social
   context, especially in lower vertebrates such as fish. In the present
   experiment, we hypothesize that group connections (network density) may
   be positively correlated to consistency of aggressiveness by avoiding
   over-aggressive acts in further encounters. To test this hypothesis, we
   used eels (Anguilla anguilla) as a model species and monitored both
   aggressiveness and sociability in 64 individuals over their first 7
   months of growth from the glass eel stage. As expected, social fish were
   less aggressive than their non-social counterparts at all times,
   highlighting the existence of a behavioural syndrome in eels.
   Additionally, rank-order consistency of aggressiveness was higher in
   groups of fish with high social connectivity, compared to those in
   less-connected fish groups. While aggressiveness must be consistent to
   be considered a personality trait, our results suggest that both
   aggressiveness and its consistency are influenced by initial social
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Covariation of individual responses to different fear-eliciting
   situations is expected to manifest in general ``fearfulness
   syndrome.{''} We tested for the existence of such a syndrome in
   wild-caught captive greenfinches. We assessed the propensity to give
   distress calls at handling, latency to feed at the presence of a
   predator image, and changes in locomotor activity in response to
   distress calls of conspecifics. Additionally, we measured the frequency
   of flapping flight movements against cage bars and tendency to damage
   tail feathers in captivity as indicators of the ability of birds to cope
   with captive conditions. As a proxy of neuroendocrine activity (an
   expected covariate of fearfulness), we measured the amount of stress
   hormone corticosterone deposited into feathers grown during captivity.
   All the behavioral traits were individually repeatable in time, but
   there were no correlations between them. Lack of the behavioral syndrome
   for fearfulness was also revealed by structural equation modelling. The
   findings of this experiment challenge the concept of a single internal
   variable responsible for fearfulness and support the proposed
   multidimensional nature of fear responses.}},

   host defences not covary?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{185-193}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fitness costs associated with brood parasitism have led host species to
   evolve several lines of defence. The first two lines of defence,
   aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at
   varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how
   these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with
   previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A
   theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that
   variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual
   variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined
   whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection
   behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the
   context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler,
   Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as
   a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high
   individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest
   guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest
   guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated
   with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation
   between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest
   defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood
   parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency
   to these responses did not correlate with any of the female
   defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately,
   this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent
   cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns
   were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo
   host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather
   than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence
   behaviour against adult brood parasites in general. (C) 2014 The

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour, or animal
   personality, are emerging as an important determinant of a wide range of
   life history traits and fitness. Individual behaviour, however, may be
   constrained by between-individual variability in energy metabolism and
   may become unstable owing to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Here we
   tested the relationship between personality and physiology using
   wild-caught bank voles, Myodes glareolus, that varied according to mtDNA
   type (original or introgressed from Myodes rutilus). Personality traits
   and their within-individual consistency were assessed using an open
   field test and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was measured in an open-flow
   respirometer. A significant relationship was found between individuals'
   consistent (repeatable) personality trait (principal component analysis
   score reflecting individual differences in proactivity) and their
   consistent (repeatable) residual BMR (body mass corrected); however,
   this association depended on mtDNA type and sex. Particularly, the males
   with original mtDNA showed a positive relationship between proactive
   behaviour and BMR, which supports the increased-intake model, stating
   that BMR is positively related to the capacity to engage in costly
   behaviours. However, this relationship was disrupted in introgressed
   males, and showed a negative trend in females, suggesting the
   alternative compensation model. According to our findings, it is likely
   that consistent differences in behavioural patterns and mtDNA types
   promote variation between individuals in energy metabolism. (C) 2014 The

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In response to acute predation threats, prey may sacrifice foraging
   opportunities in favour of increased predator avoidance. Under
   conditions of high or frequent predation risk, such trade-offs may lead
   to reduced fitness. Here, we test the prediction that prey reduce the
   costs associated with lost opportunities following acute predation
   threats by exhibiting short-term compensatory foraging responses. Under
   semi-natural conditions, we exposed female guppies Poecilia reticulate
   from high and low predation risk sites to one of three levels of acute
   predation threat (high, intermediate or low concentrations of
   conspecific alarm cues). Our results confirm previous reports,
   demonstrating that guppies from a high predation site were consistently
   `bolder' (shorter escape latencies) and exhibited graded
   threat-sensitive responses to different simulated threat levels while
   those from the low predation site were `shyer' and exhibited non-graded
   responses. Most importantly, we found that when guppies from low
   predation sites resumed foraging, they did so at rates significantly
   lower than baseline rates. However, guppies from high predation sites
   resumed foraging either at rates equal to baseline (in response to low
   or intermediate risk stimuli) or significantly increased relative to

Abstract = {{Boldness is defined as the tendency of an individual to take risks when
   exposed to novel objects or situations. The main aim of this work was to
   dilucidate if boldness was related to the development of the secondary
   sexual traits (SSTs) in the male of the river blenny Salaria
   fluviatilis, a freshwater fish which takes care of eggs. As a second
   objective SSTs effect on parental status adoption was also be explored.
   Wild young fish were caught in the Segre River (Ebro basin) in November
   2010. Fish were kept in five aquaria in groups of eight males and eight
   females with artificial nests. Boldness (boldness score and hesitancy)
   of males (initially with little SSTs development) was tested as the time
   required to exit a refuge when exposed to a new environment. Fish were
   mantained in the same aquaria for several months, and males' SSTs
   development and reproductive behaviour were monitored. Boldness score
   was negatively associated to cephalic crest development. Hesitancy was
   negatively related to male length and was also influenced by the
   interaction between male length and cephalic crest. Parental status
   acquisition was positively related to the male's length, marginally
   related to anal gland development, and non-related to cephalic crest.
   These results suggest an intrasexual role of the crest as an informative
   trait of boldness (honest signal) which might not necessarily be chosen
   by the females. It is also discussed that correlational selection could
   be responsible for linking boldness and growth rate in this species.
   Sexual selection, in addition to having directed the evolution of
   secondary sexual traits, might have favored certain personality traits
   (e.g. boldness) associated with the achievement of a larger body length.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities have been a major focus of behavioral ecology over
   the past decade. Consistent individual differences in behavior have been
   found across taxa, and have been shown to influence a range of
   ecological processes. The role of personalities in sexual selection has
   been considered, and examples exist that show selection for personality
   traits with both assortative and disassortative mating patterns between
   personality types. One overlooked aspect of the personality and sexual
   selection literature is the potential for personality-signaling
   interactions, specifically with complex signaling. Complex signaling is
   a diverse topic in itself, and in short, consists of multiple signals
   within one or more modalities that interact to elicit a receiver
   response. Research into complex signaling has been thorough, although at
   times studies discover complex signaling systems that fail to fit into
   one of the existing hypotheses in the literature. Here, we argue that
   personalities may interact with complex signaling, which should be
   considered by researchers of both personality and sexual selection and
   communication. We describe several ways in which personality-complex
   signaling interactions could affect both the signaler and receiver, and
   the way in which they may drive personality-specific signals as well as
   receiver preferences. Finally, we discuss how considering personality in
   complex signaling studies may inform theory as well as improve the
   ability of researchers to accurately describe its function.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of studies
   devoted to consistent individual differences in behavior, termed
   ``behavioral syndromes{''} or animal ``personality{''}. In particular,
   ecologists and evolutionary biologists alike seek to explore the
   functional consequences of individuals' personalities and explanations
   for their general maintenance. Understanding the mechanistic
   underpinnings to personality is arguably key to a deeper understanding
   of their functional consequences and maintenance. In particular,
   consistent individual differences in metabolic rate have been proposed
   as a general explanation for the maintenance of consistent individual
   differences in boldness, aggressiveness, and activity level. In this
   paper we explore whether consistent individual differences in boldness
   are associated with heat rate, a proxy for metabolic rate, in two
   species of orb-weaving spider: Larinioides cornutus and L. patagiatus.
   We first documented consistent individual differences in boldness in L.
   cornutus but not L. patagiatus, as estimated by individuals' latency to
   resume movement following an aversive stimulus. We also measured
   individuals' heart rate twice in a separate situation. We then tested
   for an association between individuals' boldness and their heart rate
   during these two events. We found that increased boldness was associated
   with increased heart. Thus, individuals that resumed movement quickly
   following an aversive stimulus also exhibited faster heart rates. Our
   studies provide further evidence that consistent individual differences
   in key physiological attributes, like metabolic rate, might be a general
   mechanism underlying consistent individual differences in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting species range-expansions and biological
   invasions is an important challenge in modern ecology because of rapidly
   changing environments. Recent studies have revealed that consistent
   within-species variation in behavior (i.e. animal personality) can be
   imperative for dispersal success, a key stage in the invasion process.
   Here we investigate the composition and correlation of two important
   personality traits associated with invasion success, activity and
   boldness, and how they are connected to sex and individual size in a
   newly colonised population of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis
   in Lake Vanern, Sweden. We found no effect of sex or size on behavioral
   expressions of E. sinensis but a clear positive correlation between
   boldness and activity. In addition, this study generates important
   baseline data for monitoring behavioral development, and thereby
   changing ecological impact, of an invading population over time. This
   has implications for predicting ecological effects of invasive species

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{While the ecological impacts of invasive species have been demonstrated
   for many taxonomic groups, the potential effects of behavioural
   variation among non-native individuals (i.e. personality) on these
   impacts have been largely overlooked. This is despite the fact that
   recent studies have demonstrated that, by nature, the three first stages
   of biological invasions (i.e. transport, establishment and spread) can
   lead to personality-biased populations. Freshwater ecosystems provide a
   unique opportunity to investigate this issue, notably because the
   ecological impacts of non-native species have been extensively
   documented and because animal personality has been widely studied using
   freshwater model species. Here, we aim at developing some perspectives
   on the potential effects of animal personality on the ecological impacts
   of freshwater non-native species across levels of biological
   organizations. At the individual level, personality types have been
   demonstrated to affect the physiology, metabolism, life history traits
   and fitness of individuals. We used these effects to discuss how they
   could subsequently impact invaded populations and, in turn, recipient
   communities. We also discussed how these might translate into changes in
   the structure of food webs and the functioning of invaded ecosystems.
   Finally we discussed how these perspectives could interact with the
   management of invasive species.}},

Title = {{Reliability and validity of a questionnaire survey in canine anxiety
   research}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{82-92}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Canine behavior can be assessed through behavioral testing or
   questionnaire surveys. Behavioral tests, often observed by independent
   experts, can provide objective data, but capture only a short behavioral
   sequence in a defined situation and are practical only for small study
   cohorts. Questionnaires can be targeted to much larger populations and
   provide long-term perspectives on behaviors, including potential
   correlated environmental factors. However, questionnaires are sensitive
   for misinterpretations and the subjectivity of the participant may
   affect the outcome. Therefore, particular attention has to be paid to
   structure and form of the questions to ensure that the questionnaire
   measures what it is supposed to measure. We have initiated a program on
   genetic studies in canine anxiety and have developed a questionnaire for
   behavioral phenotyping. The aim of the questionnaire is to identify the
   most fearful dogs (cases) and dogs not showing fear (controls) within
   and across breeds for gene mapping purposes. Knowing the challenges in
   the phenotyping of complex neurobehavioral traits, the aim of this study
   was to assess the external and convergent validity and re-test
   reliability of the developed questionnaire. External validity was
   assessed by comparing questionnaire data against short behavioral test
   of selected dogs (N=54), and convergent validity was estimated using
   ``known group comparisons{''}, i.e. whether the dogs with separation
   anxiety have also more noise phobia. Re-test reliability was evaluated
   from the subsample (N=36) of the owners who filled the questionnaire
   twice within an 8-month period. We found an excellent correlation
   between questionnaire data and the behavioral test, and the most
   important questions on the fearful reactions toward strangers, had the
   highest correlation with the behavioral test in which the dog met a
   stranger (mean r(s) = 0.63). Convergent validity was also well
   demonstrated by showing that a known co-morbid anxiety trait, separation
   anxiety, was more common in noise sensitive dogs as expected (Wilcoxon
   rank-sum test chi(2)(1.1732) = 9.8, p < 0.01). Similarly, the
   test-retest reliability was good (mean values: 0.69 Spearman
   correlation; 0.59 Kappa value). Most importantly, the questions asking
   the frequency of fear reactions had excellent repeatability (mean
   frequency of fear reactions toward humans, dogs and situations 0.78
   Spearman correlation, toward thunder, gunshot, fireworks, 0.76 Spearman
   correlation). These results encourage a conclusion that our
   questionnaire may serve as a reliable phenotyping tool for fearfulness
   in dogs, which, in turn, should help us to establish sufficiently large
   study cohorts for successful genetic analyses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Risk taking and avoidance responses during confinement have been
   identified in a variety of species, including fish. In addition,
   differences in metabolic rate have also been attributed to divergent
   personalities, coping styles or behavioral types. In this study we
   disclose for the first time a link between risk taking and the
   behavioral responses and oxygen consumption under confinement stress in
   the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. Fish were submitted to a
   risk-taking test twice to determine the consistency of behavioral
   responses. Afterwards fish were transferred to individual confinement
   chambers where their swimming activity and oxygen consumption were
   measured. Latency to take risks was negatively correlated to both
   movement and oxygen consumption rates, indicating that risk-avoiders
   (long latency) were less active and, hence, did not consume so much
   oxygen as risk-takers. In conclusion, this work reports the first data
   on the links between risk-taking and the behavioral responses and oxygen
   consumption during a confinement stress in fish. The relationships
   between behavioral and physiological variables are significant,
   suggesting the existence of divergent coping styles in gilthead
   seabream. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities (sometimes referred also as coping styles) and
   their fitness consequences are currently among the most intensively
   explored subjects in behavioral ecology. To estimate the evolvability
   and adaptability of individually consistent behavioral variation, there
   is a crucial need to quantify the genetics underlying personality. Here,
   we experimentally studied the repeatability of various individual
   behaviors and then estimated heritability of formed boldness,
   exploration, and aggression components in juvenile brown trout Salmo
   trutta in standardized laboratory environment. Principal component
   analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described
   by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and
   aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality
   components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were
   statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not
   the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low
   level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096). These results suggest that additive
   genetic variation underlies phenotypically consistent behavioral
   patterns, proposing that any selection acting on behavior, stress
   tolerance, or correlated traits has a potential to induce evolution in
   fish personality.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary function and maintenance of variation in animal
   personality is still under debate. Variation in the size of metabolic
   organs has recently been suggested to cause and maintain variation in
   personality. Here, we examine two main underlying notions: (i) that
   organ sizes vary consistently between individuals and cause consistent
   behavioural patterns, and (ii) that a more exploratory personality is
   associated with reduced survival. Exploratory behaviour of captive red
   knots (Calidris canutus, a migrant shorebird) was negatively rather than
   positively correlated with digestive organ (gizzard) mass, as well as
   with body mass. In an experiment, we reciprocally reduced and increased
   individual gizzard masses and found that exploration scores were
   unaffected. Whether or not these birds were resighted locally over the
   19 months after release was negatively correlated with their exploration
   scores. Moreover, a long-term mark-recapture effort on free-living red
   knots with known gizzard masses at capture confirmed that local
   resighting probability (an inverse measure of exploratory behaviour) was
   correlated with gizzard mass without detrimental effects on survival. We
   conclude that personality drives physiological adjustments, rather than
   the other way around, and suggest that physiological adjustments
   mitigate the survival costs of exploratory behaviour. Our results show
   that we need to reconsider hypotheses explaining personality variation
   based on organ sizes and differential survival.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding individual differences in cognitive performance is a major
   challenge to animal behaviour and cognition studies. We used the Eastern
   water skink (Eulamprus quoyii) to examine associations between
   exploration, boldness and individual variability in spatial learning, a
   dimension of lizard cognition with important bearing on fitness. We show
   that males perform better than females in a biologically relevant
   spatial learning task. This is the first evidence for sex differences in
   learning in a reptile, and we argue that it is probably owing to
   sex-specific selective pressures that may be widespread in lizards.
   Across the sexes, we found a clear association between boldness after a
   simulated predatory attack and the probability of learning the spatial
   task. In contrast to previous studies, we found a nonlinear association
   between boldness and learning: both `bold' and `shy' behavioural types
   were more successful learners than intermediate males. Our results do
   not fit with recent predictions suggesting that individual differences
   in learning may be linked with behavioural types via
   high-low-risk/reward trade-offs. We suggest the possibility that
   differences in spatial cognitive performance may arise in lizards as a
   consequence of the distinct environmental variability and complexity
   experienced by individuals as a result of their sex and social tactics.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Research on animal personality variation has been burgeoning in the last
   20 years but surprisingly few studies have investigated personalities in
   invertebrate species although they make up 98\% of all animal species.
   Such lack of invertebrate studies might be due to a traditional belief
   that invertebrates are just `minirobots'. Lately, studies highlighting
   personality differences in a range of invertebrate species have
   challenged this idea. However, the number of invertebrate species
   investigated still contrasts markedly with the effort that has been made
   studying vertebrates, which represent only a single subphylum. We
   describe how investigating proximate, evolutionary and ecological
   correlates of personality variation in invertebrates may broaden our
   understanding of personality variation in general. In our opinion,
   personality studies on invertebrates are much needed, because
   invertebrates exhibit a range of aspects in their life histories, social
   and sexual behaviours that are extremely rare or absent in most studied
   vertebrates, but that offer new avenues for personality research.
   Examples are complete metamorphosis, male emasculation during
   copulation, asexual reproduction, eusociality and parasitism. Further
   invertebrate personality studies could enable a comparative approach to
   unravel how past selective forces have driven the evolution of
   personality differences. Finally, we point out the advantages of
   studying personality variation in many invertebrate species, such as
   easier access to relevant data on proximate and ultimate factors,
   arising from easy maintenance, fast life cycles and short generation
   times. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing interest among biologists in animal personality,
   including in applied contexts, there have been few developmental studies
   of how and when differences in animal personality arise. And yet,
   efficient detection of personality differences early in development
   could be useful in selecting individuals for various management
   purposes. In a first step towards addressing this, we report results of
   a study of individual differences in general motor activity among
   littermates of the domestic cat, obtained using an observational method
   designed to overcome the difficulties of evaluating the behaviour of
   newborn altricial young. Three litters (14 kittens) were filmed in the
   absence of the mother at regular intervals across the 1st postnatal
   (pre-weaning) month. Six untrained observers independently viewed 10
   videos for each litter and ranked the kittens in each video from the
   least to the most active. Significant differences were found between at
   least some kittens in all three litters (Friedman tests: F-r=16.3, 25.8,
   11.3; P<0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0085, respectively), and there was significant
   agreement on kitten ranks among the six observers (Kendall coefficients
   of concordance: W=0.84, 0.84, 0.55; P<0.01 for the three litters,
   respectively). There was also significant agreement between the results
   of two observers using the ranking method and a quantitative method of
   behavioural assessment (Spearman rank order correlation: r(s)=0.93,
   P=0.001). We conclude that stable individual differences in general
   motor activity, possibly indicating differences in temperament, are
   present in kittens early in development, and that ranking the degree of
   such behaviour in a naturalistic setting provides a valid and efficient
   method of detecting such differences. It is now necessary to investigate
   if such early differences are predictive of later behavioural
   phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently emerged brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) foraging in
   still-water pools along the sides of streams tend to be either
   sedentary, feeding from the lower portion of the water column (a
   sit-and-wait tactic), or very active, feeding from the upper portion of
   the water column (an active search tactic). We tested whether the
   individual differences in foraging behavior were associated with
   baseline concentrations and responses of cortisol, a steroid hormone
   linked to personality differences in a variety of animals including
   fishes. We quantified the proportion of time spent on moving by focal
   charr in the field and then capturing them. Captured individuals were
   either (i) sacrificed immediately to quantify baseline cortisol
   concentrations, (ii) held in an unfamiliar field environment for 15 min
   and then sacrificed to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to
   handling and holding in a novel field environment, or (iii) held in an
   unfamiliar field environment with a white Plexiglas base (stressor) for
   15 min to quantify cortisol concentrations in response to a novel
   object. Eleven statistical models relating cortisol concentrations to
   the proportion of time individuals spent on moving while searching for
   prey were compared using multi-model inferencing. Cortisol
   concentrations were higher for charr that spent a lower proportion of
   time on moving in the field than for charr that spent a higher
   proportion of time on moving. For a given proportion of time spent on
   moving, mean cortisol concentrations between baseline and experimental
   treatments, our measure of cortisol response, did not differ markedly.
   Our findings suggest that the foraging tactics displayed by wild brook
   charr in the field could reflect differences in how individuals perceive
   their environment.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have revealed repeatable (among-individual) variance in
   behavioural traits consistent with variation in animal personality;
   however, these studies are often conducted using data collected over
   single sampling periods, most commonly with short time intervals between
   observations. Consequently, it is not clear whether population-level
   patterns of behavioural variation are stable across longer timescales
   and/or multiple sampling periods or whether individuals maintain
   consistent ranking of behaviours (and/or personality) over their
   lifetimes. Here, we address these questions in a captive-bred population
   of a tropical freshwater poeciliid fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Using a
   multivariate approach, we estimate the among-individual
   variance-covariance matrix (I), for a set of behavioural traits
   repeatedly assayed in two different experimental contexts (open-field
   trials, emergence and exploration trials) over long-term (56 days
   between observations) and short-term (4-day observation interval) time
   periods. In both long- and short-term data sets, we find that traits are
   repeatable and the correlation structure of I is consistent with a
   latent axis of variation in boldness. While there are some qualitative
   differences in the way individual traits contribute to boldness and a
   tendency towards higher repeatabilities in the short-term study,
   overall, we find that population-level patterns of among-individual
   behavioural (co)variance to be broadly similar over both time frames. At
   the individual level, we find evidence that short-term studies can be
   informative for an individual's behavioural phenotype over longer (e.g.
   lifetime) periods. However, statistical support is somewhat mixed and,
   at least for some observed behaviours, relative rankings of individual
   performance change significantly between data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Social animals are extraordinarily diverse and ecologically abundant. In
   understanding the success of complex animal societies, task
   differentiation has been identified as a central mechanism underlying
   the emergence and performance of adaptive collective behaviors. In this
   study, we explore how individual differences in behavior and body size
   determine task allocation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We
   found that individuals with high body condition indices were less likely
   to participate in prey capture, and individuals' tendency to engage in
   prey capture was not associated with either their behavioral traits or
   body size. No traits were associated with individuals' propensity to
   participation in web repair, but small individuals were more likely to
   engage in standard web-building. We also discovered consistent,
   differences among colonies in their collective behavior (i.e.,
   colony-level personality). At the colony level, within-colony variation
   in behavior (aggressiveness) and body size were positively associated
   with aggressive foraging behavior. Together, our findings reveal a
   subtly complex relationship between individual variation and collective
   behavior in this species. We close by comparing the relationship between
   individual variation and social organization in nine species of social
   spider. We conclude that intraspecific variation is a major force behind
   the social organization of multiple independently derived lineages of
   social spider.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of animals towards their mirror image ({''}mirror
   test{''}) is routinely used as a proxy to measure aggression levels,
   especially in fish. The lack of evidence for visual self-recognition in
   fish supports this method. However, recent work points towards different
   hormonal and gene expression responses when fish are exposed either to
   conspecific opponents or to their mirror image, urging for validation of
   this widespread method. Here, we test the predictive value of mirror
   tests in three sympatric cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika: the
   cooperative breeder Neolamprologus pulcher, the polygamous shell brooder
   Telmatochromis vittatus and the monogamous, biparental piscivore
   Lepidiolamprologus elongatus. In particular, we compare differences in
   restrained and overt aggression levels for individuals of each species
   when confronted with a mirror or a live conspecific. The three species
   differed in response to the two contest situations. While in N. pulcher
   both aggressive responses were correlated between the mirror test and
   the live opponent fight, there was no such relationship in T. vittatus
   and L. elongatus. Thus, the mirror test appears to be a suitable
   surrogate for intraspecific aggression in N. pulcher, while aggression
   against a mirror image has limited predictive value for intraspecific
   aggression in the other two species. These results underline the
   importance of validating the mirror test's predictive value in a study
   species before drawing conclusions from mirror tests about
   aggressiveness under natural, social conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Correlations between behavioural traits constrain animals to a limited
   range of behavioural choices and set a limit to the available variation
   in behavioural phenotype of a population. These constraints are
   especially important during stressful situations, potentially limiting
   the ability to cope with stress appropriately. As yet, very little
   consideration has been given to a possible role for sexual selection in
   maintaining differences in behavioural stability within individuals:
   sex-specific differences in behavioural correlations have been seldom
   studied, especially in the wild. In this field study, we investigated
   associations between neophobia (latency to enter nest in the presence of
   a novel object), nest defence (response to a model predator) and
   breathing rate in response to handling in breeding pied flycatchers
   (Ficedula hypoleuca). We did not find any significant difference in
   antipredator responses between males and females, which indicates low
   sexual conflict over parental care in the pied flycatcher. However,
   females were more neophobic than males, while males and females did not
   differ in their breathing rates. Further, our study demonstrated a
   strong positive correlation between nest defence behaviour and neophobia
   in male, but not in female pied flycatchers. Males that defended their
   nest more had lower breathing rate and higher latency to resume nestling
   feeding after encountering a predator decoy than males that mobbed less
   intensely. We found only weak evidence that nest partners might affect
   each other's behaviour in these contexts.}},

Title = {{A Theoretically Based Model of Rat Personality with Implications for
   Welfare}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{As animal personality research becomes more central to the study of
   animal behavior, there is increasing need for theoretical frameworks
   addressing its causes and consequences. We propose that regulatory focus
   theory (RFT) could serve as one such framework while also providing
   insights into how animal personality relates to welfare. RFT
   distinguishes between two types of approach motivation: promotion, the
   motivation to approach gains, and prevention, the motivation to approach
   or maintain safety. Decades of research have established the utility of
   RFT as a model of human behavior and recent evidence from zoo- housed
   primates and laboratory rats has suggested that it may be applicable to
   nonhuman animal behavior as well. Building on these initial studies, we
   collected data on 60 rats, Rattus norvegicus, navigating an automated
   maze that allowed individuals to maintain darkness (indicative of
   prevention/ safety-approach motivation) and/ or activate food rewards
   (indicative of promotion/ gain-approach motivation). As predicted, both
   behaviors showed stable individual differences (Ps < 0.01)and were
   inversely associated with physiological signs of chronic stress,
   possibly indicating poor welfare (Ps < 0.05). Subsequently, half the
   rats were exposed to a manageable threat (noxious novel object) in the
   homecage. Re-testing in the maze revealed that threat exposure increased
   darkness time achieved (P, 0.05), suggesting a mechanism by which
   prevention motivation may be enhanced. These results point toward the
   potential utility of RFT as a model for animal behavior and welfare.}},

Title = {{Individual differences in chimpanzee reconciliation relate to social
   switching behaviour}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the presence of stable individual variation in animal
   behaviour has been corroborated by studies across a wide variety of taxa
   and research disciplines. Reconciliation, or postconflict affiliation
   between former opponents, is a behavioural domain in which individual
   differences have not been systematically studied. Using a long-term data
   set comprising over 2000 conflict and postconflict observations in two
   groups of outdoor-housed chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we provide
   evidence for stable individual variation in reconciliation and test
   several hypotheses on how this postconflict mechanism relates to social
   switching behaviour. Results of generalized multilevel models revealed
   that individual differences remained a substantial source of variation
   in reconciliation after controlling for a number of situational
   variables (e. g. the nature of the relationship between opponents) shown
   by previous research to influence its occurrence. We further
   demonstrated a positive association between an individual's conciliatory
   tendency and three separate indices of social switching behaviour,
   proposing that individual differences in reconciliation may reflect a
   more fundamental motivation to switch between different social states.
   In addition to a discussion of potential motivational underpinnings, we
   provide an impetus for future work to consider how reconciliation
   relates to the broader constructs and themes identified within animal
   personality research. To the extent that individual differences in other
   aspects of conflict and postconflict repertoires exhibit temporal and
   cross-situational consistency, they too should inform our understanding
   of animal personalities. Delineating how these and other dimensions of
   sociality are in part driven by stable individual variation not only has
   implications for how social interactions themselves unfold, but
   ultimately for the fitness of the individuals therein. (C) 2014 The

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{65-71}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities can play an important role in how individuals deal
   with specific social situations, which may have important fitness
   consequences. A link between personality and social skills seems obvious
   from a human perspective and it is therefore surprising that relatively
   few studies have looked at the effect of animal personality on
   communicative interactions. In this study we tested the evidence for
   personality-related variation in birds during vocal interactions in the
   field. We scored individual variation in exploratory behaviour of great
   tits, Parus major, in repeated trials of a novel environment test in the
   laboratory and related this score to approach and vocal behaviour in
   response to playback of conspecific songs in the field. Contrary to our
   expectation, we found males with low exploration scores approached the
   speaker more closely than birds with high exploration scores. Birds with
   high exploration scores seemed to respond less aggressively while
   dealing with the simulated intruder vocally by switching song types more
   often. Our results suggest that slow-exploring birds in the laboratory
   respond more strongly during natural interactions in the field. An
   independent and very similar study also revealed a correlation between
   personality score and playback response, but with a seemingly
   contrasting outcome. A comparison of the two studies provides insights
   into the complexity of interpreting playback results and territorial
   response patterns in general. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The payoffs of an individual's behaviour vary with changing
   environmental conditions. Animals often modify their behaviours
   according to those environmental conditions (i.e. plasticity), but also
   retain consistent individual differences across environmental change
   (i.e. personality). These patterns of behavioural variation are often
   measured with respect to a single environmental variable, which raises
   the question of how individuals respond to change in combinations of
   environmental variables, and whether individual differences in behaviour
   persist across change in multiple variables. Furthermore, an
   individual's amount of plasticity in response to a change in one
   environmental variable may or may not be repeatable across change in a
   second environmental variable. To answer these questions, we
   experimentally manipulated combinations of mating, foraging and
   predation risk to determine their effect on the antipredator behaviour
   of male Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi. We found that
   the combination of environmental variables had an interactive effect on
   antipredator behaviour, but among-individual variation persisted along
   with within-individual variation in behaviour. The plasticity of
   squirrels' responses to change in one environmental variable, such as
   change in antipredator behaviour from high to low predation risk, was
   repeatable when measured in a mating environment and foraging
   environment, and vice versa. These results demonstrate patterns of
   behavioural variation across complex environments such as animals
   encounter in nature, and point towards the benefit of addressing greater
   environmental complexity in studies of animal behaviour. (C) 2014 The

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{131-139}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The role of ontogenetic processes for the emergence of personality has
   received only little attention in the past. One reason for the lack of
   experimental studies on personality development may be that trait
   consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of the definition of
   animal personality, whereas, also by definition, ontogeny deals with
   change over time. Single traits or correlations between traits may be
   consistent or inconsistent throughout ontogeny; however, the proximate
   and ultimate causes are not well understood. Environmental factors
   acting upon individuals during early ontogeny potentially influence
   personality development substantially. Early environments may severely
   constrain but also adaptively shape individuals. We examined the
   personality development of cavies, Cavia aperea, when exposed to
   increasing and decreasing photoperiod before and after birth. We
   determined how these predictive environmental cues influenced the
   development of three behavioural and two physiological traits, their
   temporal consistency and the correlations between them. We found
   remarkable plasticity in the development of personality in the cavy,
   despite a relatively high degree of temporal consistency in most traits.
   There were stable correlations, some of which became tighter over time,
   between basal cortisol levels, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness
   across two different ontogenetic stages. However, we also found that
   some correlations emerged only after maturation or disappeared over
   time. Whereas exploration behaviour was tightly correlated with basal
   cortisol and boldness was correlated with resting metabolic rate, both
   correlations disappeared in mature animals. Instead, a correlation
   between exploration and boldness was evident in mature animals. These
   results call for a broader incorporation of developmental aspects into
   personality research. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Genetic correlations between behaviors underlying a behavioral syndrome
   may constrain the capacity of a population to respond to selection on
   these behaviors. Average autonomy quantifies the extent in which
   estimated genetic (co)variances constrain the rate of evolutionary
   change of behavioral traits forming a syndrome when these traits are
   under selections in all possible directions of multivariate trait-space.
   However, it is not clear whether a calculated average autonomy value of
   an observed syndrome constitutes a significant evolutionary constraint
   or not. I here outline an approach for testing evolutionary constraint
   in a syndrome, which is based on comparing the observed genetic
   (co)variance structure to the one where the genetic covariances are
   assumed to be zero and taking onboard the uncertainty in the
   (co)variances between behaviors into the calculations of average
   autonomy. The approach can be implemented in the context of parametric
   bootstrap or Bayesian statistics, and I provide a worked example of the
   latter. I further highlight that when genetic (co)variances are
   unattainable, the between-individual (co)variances act as an interesting
   proxy, which is within reach for many behavioral studies. I provide R
   code for all calculations.}},

   Two-Spotted Gobies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{In order to attribute the behaviour of an animal to its personality it
   is important to study whether certain behavioural traits show up
   consistently across a variety of contexts. The aim of this study was to
   investigate whether breeding state males of the two-spotted goby,
   Gobiusculus flavescens, showed consistent degree of boldness when tested
   in four different behaviour assays. We also wanted to investigate
   whether boldness varied over the breeding season in accordance with
   changes in male-male competition for matings. We used two standard
   assays (the emergence test and the open field test), and two simple
   assays related to threat response. Repeated runs of each of the tests
   were highly correlated, and we found significant correlations between
   all four assays. Thus, we have documented both a within and a
   between-context consistency in risk-taking behaviour. Furthermore, we
   found that goby males studied during the middle of the breeding season
   were bolder than males studied at the end of the season. Since male
   two-spotted gobies face strongly decreasing male-male competition as the
   season progresses, the benefit of being bold for the mating success of
   the males may differ over the time of the breeding season. The
   difference in behaviour found over the season thus corresponds well with
   the sexual dynamics of this model species.}},

Abstract = {{Blue tit females that defend themselves aggressively are passive when
   they defend offspring, but this relationship is opposite in males. Our
   findings imply that the 2 sexes differentially value themselves versus
   their young possibly because of the different reproductive roles they
   have.The direction of covariation in behavioral traits (a behavioral
   syndrome) is typically the same in males and females, although
   intersexual differences in life history could lead to intersexual
   heterogeneity in syndrome structure. We explored whether a behavioral
   syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest
   defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a
   female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest
   defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days
   old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated
   records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during
   2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the
   between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1)
   hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly
   repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38\%
   repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females
   that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when
   being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling
   defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual
   correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were
   completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation.
   Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive
   behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may
   differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal
   personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our
   findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this
   heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit personality types, for example, with some
   individuals being consistently more aggressive and more willing to
   explore novel situations than others. Here, we show that although
   individual zebrafish do not show distinct personality types, whole
   populations of wild zebrafish do. Zebrafish from some populations were
   both bold and aggressive, whereas zebrafish from other areas were not.
   Our work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into
   higher order phenomena such as clade diversification.Many animals
   exhibit personality types, for example, with some individuals being
   consistently both more aggressive and more willing to explore novel
   situations than others. Often those behavioral syndromes are shaped by
   pleiotropic genetic and physiological mechanisms or joint selective
   pressures that constrain variation within and between 2 seemingly
   different types of behavior. Here, we used wild zebrafish to ask whether
   the behavioral syndromes typically measured within populations also
   occur across populations, as might be expected for syndromes created by
   forces such as a hormone with multiple effects. We found major
   differences across populations in both aggression and boldness.
   Zebrafish captured in the wild from running streams in Northern India
   were both bold and aggressive, approaching predators and conspecifics
   more frequently than did zebrafish from slower moving irrigation canals
   or a large, still, lake near Kolkata, India. We did not find any sites
   that were bold, but not aggressive, or aggressive, but not bold,
   suggesting that these behavioral combinations are not physiologically
   possible or that they are eliminated by population-level selection.
   Within populations, however, we found evidence for an
   aggression-boldness syndrome within only 1 of 5 measured populations
   (from an irrigation canal). Zebrafish also became markedly more
   aggressive after 3 months in a laboratory environment. These results
   offer a natural example of population-level personality types in wild
   organisms and show that population-level patterns and environmental
   plasticity may be as important as within-population constraints. Our
   work also confirms that wild zebrafish offer promising insight into
   higher order phenomena such as clade diversification and selection.}},

Abstract = {{One of the contemporary challenges of the behavioral syndromes
   literature is to identify how individual variation in behavior is
   determined, and whether this variation impacts ecological success.
   Although variation in experience is an obvious potential driver of
   intraspecific behavioral variation, predicting the impact of experience
   on suites of correlated behavioral traits is less intuitive.
   Specifically, if experience impacts traits that shape individuals'
   success in multiple contexts (e. g., foraging and anti-predator
   behavior), then experience could generate cross-contextual performance
   trade-offs associated with behavioral spillover. In the present study,
   we explore how sublethal experience with predators impacts various
   aspects of male behavioral tendencies in the Madagascar hissing
   cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa. First, we found that males'
   activity level and boldness were correlated together in the form of a
   behavioral syndrome. Second, we found that repeated sublethal
   interactions with predators shifted male boldness but not activity
   level, thus suggesting that the syndrome's constituent traits can
   respond to experience at least semi-independently. Third, we discovered
   that although predator exposure only influenced boldness, we found that
   boldness was highly correlated with males' ability to obtain rewarding
   positions in the harems of rival males. Taken together, our data suggest
   (but do not yet confirm) that although sublethal exposure to predators
   influences only a narrow subset of male's behavioral tendencies, these
   effects could still have nonintuitive consequences for males' success in
   functionally dissimilar ecological contexts (i.e., social and sexual
   encounters).}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of behavioral types in situ and the drivers of
   persistence are central to predicting the ecological effects of
   intraspecific behavioral variation. We surveyed individual refuge use of
   mud crabs (Panopeus herbstii), a behavior related to the strength of a
   trait-mediated trophic cascade in oyster reefs, in the absence and
   presence of toadfish (Opsanus tau) predation threat. We then released
   these crabs into the field and using mark-recapture, measured the
   repeatability of this behavior in the absence and presence of threat,
   and how behavioral change was affected by time in the field (a month on
   average, up to 81 days), crab size, and sex. Because crabs exhibited
   some evidence of a circatidal rhythm in refuge use, we also tested how
   tidal height during observation influenced behavioral change. Predation
   threat increased refuge use, and small crabs used the refuge more than
   large crabs, particularly under threat. In recaptured crabs, refuge use
   was more repeatable under threat. Neither time in the field, crab size,
   crab sex, nor tidal height had any effect on behavioral change. Our
   results support the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that (1) prey
   organisms in the presence, rather than absence, of predation threat
   should exhibit less behavioral variability because the fear of dying (a
   severe fitness consequence) should take precedence over less immediately
   important influences on behavior (e. g., hunger) and that (2) individual
   behaviors tied to fixed traits (e.g., the body size dependence of refuge
   use under threat in this study), rather than variable traits, should be
   more repeatable over time.}},

Title = {{Does Female Personality Determine Mate Choice Through Sexual
   Cannibalism?}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{238-248}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Animal personalities (e.g. consistent across-context behavioural
   differences between individuals) can lead to differences in mate choice.
   However, evidence for this link remains limited. Pre-mating sexual
   cannibalism can be a behavioural syndrome (i.e. a suboptimal
   personality) in which adaptive female aggression towards heterospecific
   prey spills over on non-adaptive aggression towards courting males,
   independently of the female mating or feeding status (i.e. the
   aggressive spillover hypothesis', ASH). On the other hand, sexual
   cannibalism can also be a form of mate choice by which females
   selectively kill or mate with males depending on the male phenotype. We
   introduce the hypothesis that the most aggressive females in the
   population will not only attack males more frequently, but will be less
   likely to impose sexual selection on males through sexual cannibalism.
   Assuming that in a field common garden experiment in which females were
   fed ad libitum the rate of weight gain by a female may reflect her
   voracity or aggressiveness, we show that in the cannibalistic burrowing
   wolf spider Lycosa hispanica (formerly L.tarantula), voracity towards
   heterospecific prey predicts a female's tendency towards sexual
   cannibalism. Unmated females with higher weight gains were more
   cannibalistic and attacked males regardless of the male phenotype. On
   the other hand, females that were less voracious tended to be less
   cannibalistic, and when they did kill a male, they were selective,
   killing males in poorer condition and mating with those in better
   condition. Our results demonstrate that females with different
   phenotypes (growth rates) differently imposed selection on male
   condition, tentatively supporting the hypothesis that female aggression
   levels can spill over on sexual selection through sexual cannibalism.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms display an impressive array of defence strategies in nature.
   Inducible defences (changes in morphology and/or behaviour within a
   prey's lifetime) allow prey to decrease vulnerability to predators and
   avoid unnecessary costs of expression. Many studies report considerable
   interindividual variation in the degree to which inducible defences are
   expressed, yet what underlies this variation is poorly understood. Here,
   we show that individuals differing in a key personality trait also
   differ in the magnitude of morphological defence expression. Crucian
   carp showing risky behaviours (bold individuals) expressed a
   significantly greater morphological defence response when exposed to a
   natural enemy when compared with shy individuals. Furthermore, we show
   that fish of different personality types differ in their behavioural
   plasticity, with shy fish exhibiting greater absolute plasticity than
   bold fish. Our data suggest that individuals with bold personalities may
   be able to compensate for their risk-prone behavioural type by
   expressing enhanced morphological defences.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Territorial aggression influences fitness and, in monogamous pairs, the
   behavior of both individuals could impact reproductive success.
   Moreover, territorial aggression is particularly important in the
   context of interspecific competition. Tree swallows and eastern
   bluebirds are highly aggressive, secondary cavity-nesting birds that
   compete for limited nesting sites. We studied eastern bluebirds at a
   field site in the southern Appalachian Mountains that has been recently
   colonized (<40 yr) by tree swallows undergoing a natural range
   expansion. The field site is composed of distinct areas where bluebirds
   compete regularly with tree swallows and areas where there is little
   interaction between the two species. Once birds had settled, we measured
   how interspecific competition affects the relationship between
   assortative mating (paired individuals that behave similarly) and
   reproductive success in eastern bluebirds. We found a strong tendency
   toward assortative mating throughout the field site. In areas of high
   interspecific competition, pairs that behaved the most similarly and
   displayed either extremely aggressive or extremely non-aggressive
   phenotypes experienced higher reproductive success. Our data suggest
   that interspecific competition with tree swallows may select for
   bluebirds that express similar behavior to that of their mate.
   Furthermore, animal personality may be an important factor influencing
   the outcome of interactions between native and aggressive, invasive
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Despite that the existence of animal personalities is widely recognized,
   no consensus has been reached on the relative importance of different
   ecological factors behind their expression. Recently, it has been
   suggested that parasites may have a crucial role in shaping animal
   personalities, but only a very few studies have experimentally tested
   the idea. We infected Eurasian minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) with the
   brain-encysted trematode parasite, Diplostomum phoxini, and studied
   whether infection could modify the personality of their hosts. Our
   results show that D. phoxini infection did not affect the mean levels of
   boldness, activity or exploration, but infected minnows showed higher
   repeatability in boldness and activity, and reduced repeatability in
   exploration. We also found that D. phoxini may be able to break the
   associations (behavioral syndromes) between behavioral traits, but that
   this effect may be dependent on parasite intensity. Furthermore, the
   effect of D. phoxini infection on personality of the hosts was found to
   be nonlinearly dependent on infection intensity. Taken together, our
   results suggest that D. phoxini parasites may shape the personality of
   their hosts, but that behavioral consequences of ecologically relevant
   infection levels may be rather subtle and easily remain undetected if
   only the mean trait expressions are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, integration of personality traits into a `pace-of-life
   syndrome' (POLS) context has been advocated. To be able to understand
   how an individual's behavioural, physiological and life history traits
   may coevolve, we need to jointly quantify these traits in order to study
   their covariance. Few studies have established links between personality
   and immunity properties of an individual. We here examined covariation
   of a measure of skeletal size (tarsus length), three behavioural traits
   (activity, handling aggression and breath rate) and two immunological
   traits (IgG level and haematocrit), in 592 wild caught blue tits. Many
   individuals (201) were tested more than once, allowing quantification of
   individual consistency of all traits and partition of the covariances
   between the traits, using a multivariate mixed model, into between
   individual and residual covariances. We find individual consistency of
   all behavioural traits, indicating that these capture aspects of blue
   tit adult personality and also the physiological measures are
   repeatable. Contrary to the POLS expectation, we find no overall
   significant individual level correlation structure between these traits
   and a factor analytical approach confirmed that between individual
   correlations across traits were not due to a common (POLS) factor or
   driven by size (tarsus length). Based on a published power study, we
   conclude that there is no common syndrome of individual level covariance
   between personality and physiological traits in wild blue tits or that
   the effect sizes, such a syndrome generates, are too low (r < 0.3) to
   detect. Future field-based work should be designed to explore low effect
   sizes and strive to measure specific traits whose involvement is
   implicated to have large effect sizes as based on, e.g. laboratory
   findings.}},

Title = {{Worker Personality and Its Association with Spatially Structured
   Division of Labor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Division of labor is a defining characteristic of social insects and
   fundamental to their ecological success. Many of the numerous tasks
   essential for the survival of the colony must be performed at a specific
   location. Consequently, spatial organization is an integral aspect of
   division of labor. The mechanisms organizing the spatial distribution of
   workers, separating inside and outside workers without central control,
   is an essential, but so far neglected aspect of division of labor. In
   this study, we investigate the behavioral mechanisms governing the
   spatial distribution of individual workers and its physiological
   underpinning in the ant Myrmica rubra. By investigating worker
   personalities we uncover position-associated behavioral syndromes. This
   context-independent and temporally stable set of correlated behaviors
   (positive association between movements and attraction towards light)
   could promote the basic separation between inside (brood tenders) and
   outside workers (foragers). These position-associated behavior syndromes
   are coupled with a high probability to perform tasks, located at the
   defined position, and a characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon profile. We
   discuss the potentially physiological causes for the observed behavioral
   syndromes and highlight how the study of animal personalities can
   provide new insights for the study of division of labor and
   self-organized processes in general.}},

Title = {{Individual differences affect honest signalling in a songbird}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1775}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Research in the past decade has established the existence of consistent
   individual differences or `personality' in animals and their important
   role in many aspects of animal behaviour. At the same time, research on
   honest signalling of aggression has revealed that while some of the
   putative aggression signals are reliable, they are only imperfectly so.
   This study asks whether a significant portion of the variance in the
   aggression-signal regression may be explained by individual differences
   in signalling strategies. Using the well-studied aggressive signalling
   system of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), we carried out repeated
   assays to measure both aggressive behaviours and aggressive signalling
   of territorial males. Through these assays, we found that aggressive
   behaviours and aggressive signalling were both highly repeatable, and
   moreover that aggressive behaviours in 2009-2010 predicted whether the
   birds would attack a taxidermic mount over a year later. Most
   significantly, we found that residual variation in signalling
   behaviours, after controlling for aggressive behaviour, was individually
   consistent, suggesting there may be a second personality trait
   determining the level of aggressive signalling. We term this potential
   personality trait `communicativeness' and discuss these results in the
   context of honest signalling theories and recent findings reporting
   prevalence of `under-signalling'.}},

   by Life-History Trade-Offs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{There have been numerous empirical studies on the fitness consequences
   of behavioural syndromes in various animal taxa; however, the ecological
   and evolutionary implications on a population level are still poorly
   understood. To better understand these implications, we develop a
   non-linear age-structured mathematical model to qualitatively examine
   the evolutionary consequences of a heritable boldness personality trait
   within an animal population. We assume that this heritable boldness
   trait is positively correlated with boldness towards predators and
   intraspecific aggressiveness. This assumption leads to a
   growth/reproductive success versus mortality trade-off, which is
   thoroughly investigated and documented in the literature. Another
   life-history trade-off we include in the model is future versus current
   reproduction, which was shown by Wolf et al. {[}1] to be a possible
   mechanism for the evolution of behavioural syndromes within an animal
   population. The stability of the system is analysed, whereby the
   characteristic equation is in the form of a homogeneous Fredholm
   equation of the second kind which depends on both the perturbation and
   equilibrium solution. The system is found to be stable due to the
   competition between individuals of similar boldness acting as a negative
   feedback mechanism. Using numerical simulations we examine the
   qualitative features of the solution to the system. In particular, we
   investigate the interplay between the mutation and competition strength
   between two individuals with different boldness, whereby we find that an
   increasing competition range acts to push individuals to both extremes
   of the shy-bold axis, while an increasing mutation range counteracts
   this effect. This qualitative trait of aggregation of individuals around
   the shy and bold extremes is also found when examining different birth,
   mortality and competition functions.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of `state' has been suggested as an underlying factor
   explaining behavioural stability and animal personality (i.e. variation
   among, and consistency within individuals in behavioural responses), but
   the possibility that stable social relationships represent such states
   remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the influence of social status
   on the expression and consistency of behaviours by experimentally
   changing social status between repeated personality assays. We used male
   domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus), a social species that forms
   relatively stable dominance hierarchies, and showed that behavioural
   responses were strongly affected by social status, but also by
   individual characteristics. The level of vigilance, activity and
   exploration changed with social status, whereas boldness appeared as a
   stable individual property, independent of status. Furthermore,
   variation in vocalization predicted future social status, indicating
   that individual behaviours can both be a predictor and a consequence of
   social status, depending on the aspect in focus. Our results illustrate
   that social states contribute to both variation and stability in
   behavioural responses, and should therefore be taken into account when
   investigating and interpreting variation in personality.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a rapid increase in animal personality research, critical gaps
   remain. We have little knowledge of the long-term (as opposed to
   short-term) consistency of personality and the relationships between
   personality and behavioural flexibility in wild, free-living animals.
   This study investigates personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual
   differences in behaviour) and contextual plasticity (i.e., plasticity in
   behaviour between contexts) of these traits in the Nazca booby (Sula
   granti), a long-lived, free-living seabird. We tested birds for
   personality in the field, during incubation, using a human intruder
   test, two novel object tests, and a social stimulus test (mirror), and
   determined repeatability of behavioural traits both within-season
   (short-term) and between several years (long-term). We found high short-
   and long-term repeatability of aggressive and anxiety-related behaviours
   when confronted with a nest intruder and novel objects, but lower
   repeatability during social stimulation. Contextual plasticity was
   highly repeatable across years for aggressive behaviours, and low for
   anxiety-related behaviours. Plasticity did not correlate across
   behaviours into a `meta-personality' trait. Contextual plasticity in
   behavioural traits was highly correlated with the expression of those
   traits, suggesting that individuals are able to both react strongly and
   modify their behaviour depending on context, perhaps due to consistent
   differences in individual quality. Model selection exercises using
   structural equation models evaluated the relationships between
   personality factors, indicating a behavioural syndrome in which anxiety-
   or agitation-related behaviours covary strongly and positively, and both
   covary weakly and negatively with aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to measure consistent individual differences in behavior (i.e.
   animal personality) fall into two categories, subjective ratings and
   behavioral codings. Ratings are seldom used despite being potentially
   more efficient than codings. One potential limitation for the use of
   ratings is that it is assumed that long-term observers or experts in the
   field are required to score individuals. This can be problematic in many
   cases, especially for long-term ecological studies where there is high
   turnover in personnel. We tested whether raters who were unacquainted
   with subjects could produce reliable and valid personality assessments
   of yellow-bellied marmots Marmota flaviventris. Two raters, previously
   unacquainted with individuals and marmot behavior, scored 130 subjects
   on fifteen different adjectives in both open-field (OF) and mirror image
   stimulation (MIS) trials. Eight OF and nine MIS adjectives were reliable
   as indicated by both a high degree of intra-observer and inter-observer
   reliability. Additionally, some ratings were externally valid,
   correlating with behavioral codings. Our data suggest that
   activity/exploration and sociability can be a reliable and valid
   measurement of personality traits in studies where raters were
   unacquainted with subjects. These traits are observable with the
   personality tests we used; otherwise researchers using unacquainted
   raters should be cautious in the tests they employ}},

Title = {{The effects of 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol on boldness and its
   relationship to decision making in male Siamese fighting fish}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes have received much attention by behavioural
   ecologists in recent years. While the relationship between boldness
   across contexts and between boldness and aggression are frequently
   investigated, little is known about how these relationships might change
   because of environmental disturbances such as exposure to endocrine
   disrupters. 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) is an oestrogen mimic that
   is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide and has severe, negative
   impacts on the behaviour and physiology of exposed organisms. To assess
   how EE2 affects boldness and decision making, male Siamese fighting
   fish, Betta splendens, received repeated trials of three boldness assays
   (novel environment, empty tank and novel object) and one decision-making
   assay (a dummy male and female presented simultaneously) before and
   after exposure to acute, nominal doses of EE2. A control group of males
   received the same number of trials but was not exposed to EE2. When
   subjects were unexposed, a behavioural syndrome was found for boldness
   across contexts. In addition, boldness was positively correlated with
   aggression in the decision-making context. EE2 exposure disrupted this
   behavioural syndrome. In summary, EE2 exposure reduced overall
   behavioural response in all contexts, disrupted the behavioural syndrome
   and reduced behavioural consistency. Thus, even nominal, short-term
   exposure to EE2 can have dramatic effects on multiple levels of
   behaviour and potentially generate severe fitness consequences on
   exposed aquatic species. This study provides the first evidence of a
   boldnesseaggression syndrome in this species and demonstrates that
   pollution may negatively influence consistent individual differences in
   behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{136-141}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There has been growing interest in the causes and consequences of
   different behavioral types within members of the same species. Male
   Siamese fighting fish consistently adopt 1 of 3 behavioral strategies
   (i.e., fighter, lover, or divider) when encountering a male and female
   conspecific simultaneously. These strategies may carry fitness
   consequences if female conspecifics attend to these differences and use
   them when selecting mates. To address this question, female Siamese
   fighting fish were repeatedly presented with video playback images of
   males expressing these strategies in a series of preference tests.
   Subjects were exposed to male stimuli both sequentially and
   simultaneously. The results suggest that females prefer males using the
   lover strategy and actively avoid fighter males. This avoidance is found
   regardless of whether the male stimuli are presented sequentially or
   simultaneously. Although presentation type did not affect expressed
   preference, it did influence strength of preference, with females
   attending more to the divider and lover behavioral types in the
   simultaneous presentations. This study highlights the importance of
   using multiple presentation formats when examining mate preference and
   demonstrates that male behavioral type may influence female choice. In
   addition, it is one of the first examinations of how male behavioral
   type may influence female mate choice and suggests that female choice
   may be a mechanism for generating and/or maintaining differences in
   behavioral type.}},

Title = {{Boldness and Stress Responsiveness as Drivers of Nest-Site Selection in
   a Ground-Nesting Bird}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nest-site selection involves trade-offs between the probability of nest
   discovery by egg predators, danger to the incubating parent from
   predators and provision of an appropriate microclimate for incubation,
   and all three components are potentially influenced by nest concealment
   and distance to habitat edge. Personality traits also affect habitat
   choice, and the trade-off hypothesis suggests that variable
   stress-coping strategies may evolve because individuals prioritize
   either productivity (proactive coping) or survival (reactive coping),
   both of which cannot be simultaneously maximized. Applying this
   hypothesis to understand nest-site selection by female eider ducks
   (Somateria mollissima), we predicted that bold individuals with
   attenuated stress responsiveness should select concealed nests further
   away from the shore, thereby promoting clutch survival at the potential
   expense of reduced escape opportunities for themselves. In testing this
   prediction, we controlled for individual quality (female body condition
   and breeding experience) and verified that individual stress responses
   and nest-site preferences were consistent by analysing their
   repeatability. Finally, we analysed how the viable proportion of the
   clutch was related to nest-site and female characteristics. Our
   prediction was supported: bold females {[}short flight initiation
   distance (FID)] and those with lower handling-induced body temperature
   were found in concealed nests, and bold females and those with lower
   handling-induced corticosterone concentrations occupied nests farther
   from the shore. The viable proportion of the clutch peaked at
   intermediate proportional nest-cover and increased linearly with
   increasing nest distance from the shore. Stress coping styles may thus
   be related to nest-site selection, but their fitness consequences may be
   manifested indirectly through the nest-site characteristics.}},

   Coral Reef Fish}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{The theory of behavioral syndromes focuses on quantifying variation in
   behavior within and among individual organisms and attempts to account
   for the maintenance of differences in behavior that occur in a
   consistent manner among individuals. Behavioral syndromes have
   potentially important ecological consequences (e.g. survivorship
   tradeoffs) and can be shaped by population dynamics through selective
   mortality. Here, we search for any evidence for consistency of behavior
   across situations in juveniles of a common damselfish, Pomacentrus
   amboinensis (Pomacentridae) at the transition between larval habitats in
   the plankton and juvenile habitats on the reef. Naive fish leaving the
   pelagic phase to settle on reefs were caught by light traps and their
   behaviors observed using similar methods across three different
   situations (small aquaria, large aquaria, field setting); all of which
   represent low risk and well-sheltered environments. Seven behavioral
   traits were compared within and among individuals across situations to
   determine if consistent behavioral syndromes existed. No consistency was
   found in any single or combination of behavioral traits for individuals
   across all situations. We suggest that high behavioral flexibility is
   likely beneficial for newly-settled fish at this ontogenetic transition
   and it is possible that consistent behavioral syndromes are unlikely to
   emerge in juveniles until environmental experience is gained or certain
   combinations of behaviors are favored by selective mortality.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural traits that co-vary across contexts or situations often
   reflect fundamental trade-offs which individuals experience in different
   contexts (e. g. fitness trade-offs between exploration and predation
   risk). Since males tend to experience greater variance in reproductive
   success than females, there may be considerable fitness benefits
   associated with ``bolder{''} behavioural types, but only recently have
   researchers begun to consider sex-specific and life-history strategies
   associated with these. Here we test the hypothesis that male
   three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) show high risk but
   potentially high return behaviours compared to females. According to
   this hypothesis we predicted that male fish would show greater
   exploration of their environment in a foraging context, and be caught
   sooner by an experimenter than females. We found that the time fish
   spent out of cover exploring their environment was correlated over two
   days, and males spent significantly more time out of cover than females.
   Also, the order in which fish were net-caught from their holding
   aquarium by an experimenter prior to experiments was negatively
   correlated with the time spent out of cover during tests, and males
   tended to be caught sooner than females. Moreover, we found a positive
   correlation between the catch number prior to our experiments and nine
   months after, pointing towards consistent, long-term individual
   differences in behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Personality traits are important because they can affect individual
   survival as well as how a population may respond to environmental
   change. How these traits arise, whether they are maintained throughout
   ontogeny, and how environmental factors differentially affect them
   throughout life is poorly understood. Understanding these pathways is
   important for determining the function and evolution of animal
   personality. We examined the development of two commonly studied
   personality traits, boldness and docility, in a long-term study of
   yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. Using data collected
   between 2002 and 2011, we quantified the repeatability within three age
   groups (juveniles, yearlings and adults), the correlation between age
   classes, and the behavioural syndromes of these two traits within the
   three life stages. We quantified boldness through flight initiation
   distance (FID) tests, and we quantified docility through marmots'
   response to being trapped. We found that boldness was repeatable only in
   yearlings, but docility was repeatable in all age classes. We also found
   that juvenile docility predicted later docility. We also found no
   behavioural syndrome between boldness and docility in any life stage.
   This suggests an adaptive hypothesis: that these personality traits
   develop independently and at potentially age-appropriate times. Thus,
   the development of personality traits may facilitate animal's coping
   with age-dependent requirements and constraints. (C) 2013 The

Title = {{Personality Variation in Little Brown Bats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality or temperament refers to individual differences in
   behaviour that are repeatable over time and across contexts. Personality
   has been linked to life-history traits, energetic traits and fitness,
   with implications for the evolution of behaviour. Personality has been
   quantified for a range of taxa (e. g., fish, songbirds, small mammals)
   but, so far, there has been little work on personality in bats, despite
   their diversity and potential as a model taxon for comparative studies.
   We used a novel environment test to quantify personality in little brown
   bats (Myotis lucifugus) and assess the short-term repeatability of a
   range of behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that development
   influences values of personality traits and predicted that trait values
   associated with activity would increase between newly volant,
   pre-weaning young-of-the-year (YOY) and more mature, self-sufficient
   YOY. We identified personality dimensions that were consistent with past
   studies of other taxa and found that these traits were repeatable over a
   24-hour period. Consistent with our prediction, older YOY captured at a
   fall swarming site prior to hibernation had higher activity scores than
   younger YOY bats captured at a maternity colony, suggesting that
   personality traits vary as development progresses in YOY bats. Thus, we
   found evidence of short-term consistency of personality within
   individuals but with the potential for temporal flexibility of traits,
   depending on age.}},

Abstract = {{Non-human animal personality is defined as consistent behavioural
   differences across time and situations/contexts. Behaviours are,
   however, often plastic and to explain how plasticity and personality may
   coexist an adaptive framework has been developed. Still, there is little
   information on how personality is impacted by situations and contexts on
   an individual level. We investigated this in the European mink (Mustela
   lutreola) by performing a set of five experiments in two situations
   consisting of non-breeding and breeding season, and by using different
   test contexts. Three personality trait domains were identified;
   boldness, exploration and sociability. The levels of boldness and
   exploration changed between seasons but remained repeatable, which
   implies behavioural reaction norms and supports that the concept of
   personality remained applicable despite plasticity. Whilst males became
   bolder and more explorative in the breeding season females became shyer,
   which reflects European mink breeding behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours
   performed in mirror stimulus tests fell into different domains depending
   on whether, the test was conducted in the own territory or not,
   suggesting plasticity in the response towards conspecifics. To conclude,
   our results highlight the importance of situation and context for the
   expression of personality, and the significance of measuring multiple
   personality trait domains with several methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Personality and predictability in fallow deer fighting behaviour: the

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1041-1047}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Individuals often differ from each other in how they respond to
   environmental events: a feature of behaviour often termed animal
   personality. Furthermore, animals often show unpredictability in how
   much they respond to these events over time leading to the suggestion
   that personality and intraindividual variability (IIV) might have
   important fitness consequences. We investigated this hypothesis by
   focusing on the tendency for individually identifiable male fallow deer,
   Dama dama, to escalate low-level (noncontact) agonistic interactions to
   fighting during the rut. Males differed in their tendency to escalate
   noncontact interactions to fighting; however, repeatability in
   escalation rates was unstable over the rut suggesting that escalation
   rate is a poor measure of personality. There was no difference in the
   level of IIV in escalation rate shown by males. A comparison of IIV
   recorded over two consecutive annual ruts showed that IIV was highly
   correlated between years; therefore, over an extended time period
   individuals were consistent in their willingness to engage in fighting.
   There was a nonlinear relationship between IIV and mating success;
   specifically, individuals that showed either low or high IIV in
   escalation rate had lower mating success than individuals that showed
   intermediate levels of IIV. Aggression and the willingness to commit to
   fighting are important fitness correlates; nevertheless, our
   understanding of how personality and IIV are related to aggression is
   poorly understood. This study shows that although escalation rate
   appears to be a poor measure of personality in the fallow deer, IIV is
   related to increased fitness in individuals that show intermediate
   levels of predictability in their willingness to fight over the rut. (C)

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1320-1326}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in personality or temperament have
   been observed in many animal taxa, and one particular trait, boldness,
   has been studied extensively. Most studies on mate choice and
   personality have focused on female preference and have showed that
   females prefer to mate with bolder males. However, the influence of the
   females personality on this mate preference and on her compatibility
   with a mate with particular traits has been largely neglected. Here,
   using the guppy Poecilia reticulata, we investigated the effect of
   female boldness on mate choice and of the combinations of this trait in
   the male and female of a mating pair on parturition and brood size. Our
   results showed that female boldness did not affect mate choice, and
   brood size was independent of the boldness of the male and female in a
   pair. However, overall, females who mated with males with a dissimilar
   degree of boldness to themselves had a lower parturition success than
   females who mated with males with a similar degree of boldness. This
   work suggests that the combination of boldness characteristics within a
   pair influences reproductive success and that individuals of similar
   personality are more compatible in reproduction. The lower success of
   disassortative matings is consistent with the hypothesis that variation
   in personalities is maintained by disruptive or frequency-dependent
   selection, driven by contrasting physical or social environments that
   favor alternative rather than intermediate behavioral phenotypes.}},

Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{937-947}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A common method to assess behavioral types in personality research
   involves the use of a single emergence test (employed by researchers
   working on fish, avian, mammal, amphibian, and invertebrate taxa),
   whereby a shorter latency to emerge from a holding container into a
   novel environment is inferred to represent greater boldness'. Although
   any behavior might be context specific, studies using this single assay
   type must assume it reflects boldness in other similar contexts,
   otherwise it cannot reflect personality (defined as consistency across
   time and/or contexts). We attempted to validate whether a single assay
   of this type is correlated with other similar assays of boldness under
   more familiar, and less stressful, situations. We compared single
   emergence test scores of two species of damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi;
   P.amboinensis) in a novel environment, with two different behavioral
   assays of the same fish in subsequent repeated trials in home tanks.
   Although behavior was highly repeatable in home tanks, we found no
   correlation between emergence test scores in the novel environment and
   measures of latency to emerge from shelter following disturbance, or
   activity levels, on the first, second, or third observations in home
   tanks; there was also no correlation when we used average home tank
   scores from mixed models that accounted for individual differences
   (i.e., plasticity) in the rate of habituation (latency) and acclimation
   (activity). Our results therefore lead us to question the validity of
   using this single emergence test assay as a predictor of general
   boldness and to question the use of any single assay of behavior in
   personality research.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{970-982}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural phenotypes can be studied from a variety of perspectives.
   Recent developments have focused on the individual, seeking patterns of
   behaviour that are stable over time and/or across different contexts
   (animal personalities). This study applied this method of understanding
   individual behavioural variability to domestic guinea pigs. Two
   behavioural domains were investigated: emotionality and social
   behaviour. Additionally, individual cortisol-stress reactivity and
   dominance status were examined. Adult male domestic guinea pigs living
   in large mixed-sex colonies were subjected to a series of behavioural
   and physiological tests twice with an intertest interval of 8wk.
   Individual consistency over time was found regarding social behaviour,
   cortisol reactivity and dominance status, whereas no stability regarding
   emotional behaviour was detected. Furthermore, no stability over
   contexts was found. Our results suggest that the concept of animal
   personality is applicable to domestic guinea pigs. The ecological
   relevance of these data is underscored by the fact that they were
   obtained in animals from a very rich, socially complex scenario.
   Moreover, our study highlights that behaviour alone is not sufficient to
   describe individual phenotypic consistency. Physiological parameters
   such as stress reactivity should be included in animal personality
   research. Furthermore dominance - a relative measure which is not an
   absolute attribute of individuals - proved to be stable over time and
   thus also shed light on individuality.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Personality on a Group-Level Process: Shy Hermit Crabs
   Make Longer Vacancy Chains}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1014-1023}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality has been investigated in a variety of contexts but
   few studies have investigated the effects of individual-level traits on
   processes that occur at the group or population level. Vacancy chains
   describe sequences of linked vacancy moves in systems where individuals
   use discrete and reuseable resource units. When a new resource unit
   becomes available, this can cause a cascade of moves between resource
   units, beyond the first individual that encounters the new unit. Thus,
   vacancy chains can drive the distribution of resources through a
   population. Here, I investigate the effect of variation in boldness on
   movements between vacant gastropod shells in the hermit crab Pagurus
   bernhardus. Boldness was quantified using the duration of a startle
   response, which varied consistently between individuals. In groups of
   five crabs, introduction of a single new shell led to aggregate
   benefits, in terms of improving shell quality, across all group members.
   Boldness did not influence the extent of these benefits or the extent to
   which they were distributed between crabs of different sizes. Initially,
   vacancy chains were longer, indicating that more individuals moved
   between shells, for bold groups compared with shy groups. After 24h,
   however, the chain length was longer for shy groups. Thus, although
   participation in a vacancy chain may lead to similar benefits, these
   could be more widespread for groups comprising shy individuals that show
   long startle responses, low inquisitiveness and low aggression. Similar
   effects on resource acquisition could be present in other examples of
   animals that utilise reusable resource units and show consistent
   between-individual differences in behaviour.}},

Title = {{Physiological, Behavioral and Maternal Factors That Contribute to Size
   Variation in Larval Amphibian Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a
   pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions
   between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and
   maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have
   been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations,
   teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates
   remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these
   interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also
   requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the
   relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors,
   neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and
   metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel
   experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions,
   hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and
   maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development
   in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within
   experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was
   associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food
   restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage
   among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a
   role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in
   response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings
   suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have
   long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise
   compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic
   factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians.}},

Abstract = {{Studies increasingly explore whether there is variation between
   individuals in how they adjust their behavior to different environmental
   contexts using random regression analysis (RR). RR estimates the
   between-individual variance in elevation (expected behavior in the mean
   environment) and variance in plasticity (individual-specific adjustment
   of behavior to the environment) and the covariance between these
   properties. These (co)variances allow deriving both environment-specific
   repeatability estimates and the individual-level correlation in behavior
   between environmental conditions, both of which are of key interest for
   understanding consistency in behavior over space and time, a core issue
   in animal personality research. However, very few studies use the RR
   estimates to produce this information. In this paper, I outline how to
   extract this information (including example code in R) and apply the
   approach to 16 estimates based on nine published RR studies. Despite the
   fact that the behaviors have a decent repeatability under different
   environmental conditions, I find that in half the cases, the
   cross-environmental correlation is low (< 0.4). This implies that
   individuals differ in their behavioral trait values but that the ranking
   of these individual values tends to change between environmental
   conditions. This level of inconsistency in animal personality traits
   appears not to have been fully appreciated, and future studies on
   plasticity using RR should explicitly include it.}},

Volume = {{280}},
Number = {{1767}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Deciphering the mechanisms involved in shaping social structure is key
   to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes leading to
   sociality. Individual specialization within groups can increase colony
   efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis
   that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness
   and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation
   (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events
   across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of
   developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism.
   Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of
   boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with
   being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey
   capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance
   from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with
   emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey
   capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics.
   Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was
   associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance.
   Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social
   spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that
   personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory
   settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in
   the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual
   behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social
   organization in a diversity of animals.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, consistent behavioural differences among individuals
   are linked to fitness variation. Determining the environmental and
   genetic factors that mould these behavioural types is crucial to
   understanding how behaviours might respond to selection. Male bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, show extensive consistent behavioural
   variation in their levels of courtship, male-directed aggression and
   female-directed aggression, resulting in a range of fitness-related
   behavioural types coexisting within a population. To determine whether
   the behavioural components underlying a male's stable behavioural type
   in the mating context are heritable and genetically correlated, we
   performed paternal half-sib crosses. Using animal models, we found that
   all three of these mating behaviours were moderately heritable (h(2) =
   0.17-0.29) and courtship behaviour was also heritable as a binomial
   trait (court yes/no: h(2) = 0.50). Including effects of dam
   identity/common rearing environment experienced by full sibs decreased
   model fit, suggesting that early social interactions might contribute to
   behavioural types. In addition, we found evidence consistent with the
   possibility that the positive phenotypic correlations among mating
   behaviours are underlain by positive genetic correlations. Thus, it is
   possible that the seemingly maladaptive aggression that males direct
   towards females during social interactions persist due to genetic
   constraints and direct selection on male-directed aggression and
   courtship behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Intragenotypic variability (IGV) occurs when individuals with the same
   genotype, reared in the same environment and then tested under the same
   conditions, express different trait values. Game theoretical and
   bet-hedging models have suggested two ways that a single genotype might
   generate variable behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete
   rather than continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces
   different types of individuals, each of which consistently expresses a
   different type of behaviour) or stochastic variability (a genotype
   produces one type of individual that randomly expresses different types
   of behaviour over time). We first demonstrated significant differences
   across 14 natural genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the
   variability (as measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice in an
   experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four different
   types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about ways that
   within-individual variability might contribute to differences across
   genotypes in the variability of microhabitat choice. There was no
   empirical support for three hypotheses (behavioural polymorphism,
   consistent choice, or time-based choice), nor could our results be
   attributed to genotypic differences in activity levels. The stochastic
   variability hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept
   of the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the individual
   level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our initial version of
   the stochastic model slightly but significantly overestimated the values
   of individual entropy for each genotype, pointing to specific
   assumptions of this model that might need to be adjusted in future
   studies of the IGV of microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of
   recent studies to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and
   the first to explore ways that genotypic differences in
   within-individual variability might contribute to differences among
   genotypes in the predictability of their behaviour. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Behavioral differences among individuals are common and are organized
   into personalities in a wide variety of species. Hypotheses for the
   coexistence of behavioral differences fall into 3 categories: variation
   in selection, frequency-dependent selection, and behavioral plasticity.
   We tested predictions of those hypotheses regarding geographic
   covariation of behavior with ecology, using a recent (40 years)
   biological invasion of common waxbills (Estrilda astrild). Behavior in
   tests for exploration and social interaction covaried among individuals,
   suggesting a behavioral syndrome, although we could only demonstrate
   within-individual repeatability in the test for social interaction.
   These 2 behaviors changed geographically with the ecology of sites
   (degree of climate variation) in an apparently adaptive way, rather than
   with the direction of invasion. We found behavioral plasticity but
   showed that short-term plastic effects do not explain geographic
   divergence. Differential dispersal does not explain geographic
   divergence either, which is orthogonal to the direction of invasion.
   Results are best interpreted either as evolved divergences, although a
   candidate-gene approach could not identify genetic correlates of
   behavior, or as long-term behavioral plasticity (e.g., effects of
   rearing environment). In this recent invasion, geographic differences in
   ecology and behavior equate to repeated and fast changes over time.
   Thus, fluctuations in ecological conditions, which are common in nature,
   may have a widespread role maintaining behavioral and personality
   differences via selection and/or long-term behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling bias is a key issue to consider when designing studies to
   address biological questions and its importance has been widely
   discussed in the literature. However, some forms of bias remain
   underestimated. We investigated the roosting decisions of free-living
   great tits utilizing nest-boxes in response to the installation of a
   novel object (a miniature video camera) inside their nest-boxes. We show
   that birds that score highly on a widely used exploration test (i.e.,
   fast explorers) are more likely to accept and approach novel objects
   used in a seemingly unobtrusive sampling technique; thus, the sample
   collected overrepresents fast explorers. This form of behavior-related
   bias, sensitivity to novel objects, has largely been overlooked in
   sampling design. We demonstrate potential pitfalls of neglecting this
   behavior-related sampling bias in biological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Repeatable behavioural traits ('personality') have been shown to covary
   with fitness, but it remains poorly understood how such
   behaviour-fitness relationships come about. We applied a multivariate
   approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in
   exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in
   reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes
   caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for
   provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and
   reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed
   their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the
   same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased
   female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production.
   Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning
   behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their
   offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus
   increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for
   specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural
   syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between
   behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when
   considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance
   of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to
   the study of behavioural evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, i.e. consistent differences in behavior across
   time and/or context, have received increased attention of behavioral
   biologists over the last years. Recent research shows that personalities
   represent traits on which natural and sexual selection work and which
   can have substantial fitness consequences. The aim of this study is to
   establish the personality structure of crested macaque (Macaca nigra)
   males as foundation for future studies on its adaptive value. We
   collected behavioral data through focal animal sampling and additionally
   conducted two sets of playback experiments. Results of a factor analysis
   on the behavioral data revealed a four factor structure with components
   we labeled Anxiety, Sociability, Connectedness and Aggressiveness.
   Results from the experiments revealed an additional and independent
   Boldness factor but the absence of Neophilia. Overall, this structure
   resembles other macaque and animal species with the exception of
   Connectedness, which might be a consequence of the species' tolerant
   social style. Our results thus not only form the basis for future
   studies on the adaptive value of personality in crested macaques but
   also contribute an important data point for investigating the evolution
   of personality structure from a comparative perspective by refining, for
   example, which personality factors characterized the last common
   ancestor of hominids and macaques.}},

Abstract = {{Research in animal personality has been increasing over the last decade,
   as scientists realize its importance to health outcomes. In particular,
   personality has sometimes been used, in conjunction with other tools,
   for aspects of captive management, including decreasing stress,
   increasing positive health outcomes, successful breeding, and infant
   survival. A few such studies have focused on felids, and have shown that
   there are possible applications for personality in that taxon. This
   study looked at the Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia), a
   critically endangered species, with only an estimated 400 left in the
   wild. Raters assessed 25 Scottish wildcats on 42 traits and on a
   subjective well-being questionnaire. Mean inter-rater reliability on the
   personality items was 0.59 and 0.53 on the subjective well-being items.
   Three personality components were found using principal-components
   analysis: Dominance, Agreeableness, and Self Control. Higher Self
   Control was related to higher subjective well-being (r = 0.67, P <
   0.01). Implications for the results of this and other similar studies
   are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour are present in most
   animal populations. Historically, the fitness consequences of
   behavioural types (e.g. bold and shy) have been investigated in one
   focal species at a time. Studies generally disregard variation in
   heterospecifics that interact with those types. However, intraspecific
   variation in behavioural types of multiple interactors could generate
   dependent effects of behavioural type x behavioural type in species
   interactions and might serve as a mechanism maintaining phenotypic
   variation in wild populations. Here we examined how behavioural types of
   both predators and prey jointly determine the outcome of a predatoreprey
   interaction using the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, and a
   syntopic field cricket, Gryllus integer. We assayed the antipredator
   (boldness) behaviour of individual G. integer and the boldness during
   foraging site selection of individual L. hesperus, as estimated by the
   spiders' tendency to settle in safe versus high-risk foraging
   environments. The best-fit models predicting prey survivorship and
   predator foraging success indicate that the behavioural tendencies of
   both predator and prey, as well as the interaction between them, jointly
   affect the outcome of staged predatoreprey interactions. These models
   boasted R-2 values 3-10 times those of models that considered
   behavioural type variation in either predator or prey alone. Our
   findings highlight the importance of considering the behavioural types
   of multiple interactors when testing the effects of behavioural types on
   species interactions and individual performance. More generally, our
   results strongly suggest that attention should be paid to multiple
   interactors if we are to understand the outcomes of species
   interactions. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Positive reinforcement training (hereafter known as training) has
   increasingly been adopted in zoos, to facilitate complex veterinary
   procedures without sedation or restraint and support husbandry
   requirements. However, empirical studies to establish the efficacy of
   training or investigate its impact on keeper-animal relationships are
   scarce; this was the topic of the current investigation. Study animals
   were classified as formally trained (FT) partially trained (PT) or
   untrained (UT). Eight black rhinoceros (2FT, 2PT \& 4UT), twelve
   Sulawesi crested black macaques (4FT, 4PT \& 4UT) and eleven Chapman
   zebra (4FT, 2PT \& 5UT) were studied in 6 zoos across the UK and USA.
   Subtle cues and commands provided by keepers directed towards the
   animals were identified and the latency between these and the respective
   behavioural responses (cue-response) were recorded. Animal personalities
   were also assessed using trait ratings completed by keepers for each
   animal. Social species (zebra and macaques) responded quicker to cues
   than the solitary species (rhino; F-2 = 13.716, p < 0.001). FT animals
   responded quicker to keeper cues than PT and UT animals (F-2,F-22=
   6.131, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the
   cue-response latencies according to personality traits (Z = -1.576, p >
   0.05). Data suggested that trained group living animals had reduced
   latencies when reacting to keeper's cues, regardless of their
   personality. If we consider short cue-response latencies to be
   indicative of low fear, then we suggest that training can potentially
   reduce animals' fear of humans thus could contribute to positive
   keeper-animal relationships which in turn could lead to improved animal
   welfare. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{When animals are observed on multiple occasions, consistent
   between-individual differences in behaviour, often referred to as animal
   personality, may be observed. However, this does not mean that the
   behaviour of a given individual is readily predictable. While some
   individuals show low levels of variation around their behavioural mean,
   others show high levels of variation, and there may be significant
   between-individual differences in this intraindividual variation ('IIV')
   in behaviour. While it has been suggested that IIV might reduce
   susceptibility to predators, little is known about the functions or
   causation of IIV. We investigated the effects of temperature on the
   startle response duration of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus. For
   poikilothermic animals, temperature has a direct and multiplicative
   influence on metabolic rate, which in turn is expected to influence
   behaviour because of its effect on energy requirements. At the level of
   mean startle response durations, the effect of temperature was dependent
   on treatment order; within treatment orders, individuals showed
   different reaction norms. In contrast, at the level of IIV, while the
   presence of significant between-individual differences was dependent on
   treatment order, there was a clear unidirectional effect in both
   treatment orders for individuals to be less predictable at higher
   temperature. Thus, predictability in behaviour appears to vary with a
   key environmental variable that is known to influence energy
   requirements and potentially the level of risk that individuals are
   willing to accept. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Behaviors are commonly correlated between individuals in so-called
   behavioral syndromes. Between-individual correlations of phenotypic
   traits can change the trajectories of evolutionary responses available
   to populations and even prevent evolutionary change if underpinned by
   genetic correlations. Whether behavioral syndromes also influence the
   course of evolution in this manner remains unknown. Here, we provide the
   first test of the degree to which evolutionary responses might be
   affected by behavioral syndrome structure. This test, based on a
   meta-analysis of additive genetic variancecovariance matrices, shows
   that behavioral syndromes constrain potential evolutionary responses by
   an average of 33\%. For comparison, correlations between life-history or
   between morphological traits suggest constraints of 1318\%. This finding
   demonstrates that behavioral syndromes might substantially constrain the
   evolutionary trajectories available to populations, prompts novel future
   directions for the study of behavioral syndromes, emphasizes the
   importance of viewing syndrome research from an evolutionary
   perspective, and provides a bridge between syndrome research and
   theoretical quantitative genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Animals within a population differ consistently in behavior over time
   and/or across conditions. A general question is how such differences
   referred to as personalities are maintained through evolution. One
   suggested mechanism is a nonrandom mate choice, which has been supported
   in species in which mate choice associates with direct material
   benefits. Much less is known about mating patterns and personality in
   species where males provide only sperm and in which the benefits of
   female choice are based only on good and/or compatible genes. The bridge
   spider Larinioides sclopetarius Clerck (Araneidae) exhibits heritable
   between-individual differences in intrasex aggressiveness. We studied
   mating probabilities by aggressiveness type of both sexes, and success
   in sperm competition of aggressive versus nonaggressive males. We staged
   trials that resemble field conditions: 4 males (2 aggressive and 2
   nonaggressive) had simultaneous choice between an aggressive and a
   nonaggressive female. Although there were no differences in initial
   approaches of male types toward female types, aggressive males mainly
   mated with aggressive females, and nonaggressive males more likely mated
   with nonaggressive females. Female aggressiveness type was not related
   to fecundity, which may be a consequence of equal food supply in the
   laboratory. However, in double-mating trials using the sterile-male
   technique to measure paternity of aggressive versus nonaggressive males,
   we found that sons of aggressive parents fathered relatively more
   offspring. We conclude that assortative mating by aggressiveness type
   might maintain between-individual differences in aggressiveness in L.
   sclopetarius.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, animal personality researchers have called for
   integrative approaches to study behavioral, immunological, and
   life-historical traits. This is because life history and personality
   have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes.
   Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to
   associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because
   behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we
   quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and
   genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of
   behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from
   disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function
   (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and
   maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus
   integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range:
   encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas
   behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and
   encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass
   were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was
   positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack
   of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that
   the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there
   were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between
   behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and
   encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these
   associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results
   support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an
   evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that
   behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{Although our understanding of how animal personality affects fitness is
   incomplete, one general hypothesis is that personality traits (e.g.
   boldness and aggressiveness) contribute to competitive ability. If so,
   then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate
   variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here,
   we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of
   sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was
   evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest
   behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were
   also detected. A single vector explains 80 \% of the among-individual
   variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness.
   We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable
   tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster
   post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a
   dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there
   was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often
   predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may
   sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather
   than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as
   aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through
   impacts on resource acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour of animals, that is,
   personalities, are both widespread and widely studied, but very few
   studies also include cognitive traits in this context. Animal
   personality has recently been integrated into the pace-of-life-syndrome
   hypothesis, relating individual behavioural traits to life history.
   Variation in cognitive traits could be explained well by this
   theoretical framework. A risk-reward trade-off might lead to different
   cognitive types: Active birds that learn fast, take risks and probably
   have a fast lifestyle and less active, slow learning birds that are risk
   averse but thereby perform better in reversal learning as they probably
   pay more attention to external cues. We investigated the performance of
   zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in a cognitively challenging
   reversal learning task and linked this to two personality traits:
   activity and fearfulness. Male birds were better in reversal learning
   than females. While no personality-related differences occurred in the
   initial learning of our task, more active and fearful birds relearned
   the cue-reward association faster. While birds of different sex might
   have revealed different risk-taking strategies in the training, our
   findings do not reveal the expected direction of a risk-reward trade-off
   in the reversal learning. It seems likely that a more general and
   personality-related cognitive ability might improve performance across
   different tasks. The linkage between personality and cognition
   documented here could hence suggest that cognitive traits are indeed
   part of an overall pace-of-life syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Activity budgets of animals often show consistent differences between
   individuals across time, which qualifies them as personality traits. In
   the case of captive birds, locomotor activity can be divided into two
   major components - frequency of hopping and flapping flight bouts, which
   may conceive different information about individual condition. This idea
   was tested in a 2{*}2 factorial experiment in wild-caught captive
   greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), injected with bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or temporarily exposed to an image of a
   predator. We predicted that LPS injection would reduce both types of
   activity via induction of sickness syndrome and that predator image
   treatment would either increase or decrease different components of
   activity. Both behavioural traits were similarly consistent in time over
   a 10-d period but the correlations between them depended on measurement
   context. LPS treatment reduced flapping and hopping frequencies and
   total locomotor activity. Exposure to the predator image had no effect
   on flapping frequency, but it decreased hopping frequency and total
   locomotor activity among the birds that were initially most active. The
   effects of both treatments on behaviour were relatively long-lasting,
   that is, detectable at least 87h after LPS injection and 44h after
   exposure to the predator image. Our findings demonstrate the existence
   of two components of locomotor activity that responded similarly to the
   physiological but differently to the psychological stressor. The
   distinction between such components thus increases the information
   content of activity recordings of caged birds, which is likely to reveal
   novel aspects of covariation between different aspects of stress
   responsiveness and other performance parameters.}},

Title = {{Weevil x Insecticide: Does `Personality' Matter?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{An insect's behavior is the expression of its integrated physiology in
   response to external and internal stimuli, turning insect behavior into
   a potential determinant of insecticide exposure. Behavioral traits may
   therefore influence insecticide efficacy against insects, compromising
   the validity of standard bioassays of insecticide activity, which are
   fundamentally based on lethality alone. By extension, insect
   `personality' (i.e., an individual's integrated set of behavioral
   tendencies that is inferred from multiple empirical measures) may also
   be an important determinant of insecticide exposure and activity. This
   has yet to be considered because the behavioral studies involving
   insects and insecticides focus on populations rather than on
   individuals. Even among studies of animal `personality', the relative
   contributions of individual and population variation are usually
   neglected. Here, we assessed behavioral traits (within the categories:
   activity, boldness/shyness, and exploration/avoidance) of individuals
   from 15 populations of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), an
   important stored-grain pest with serious problems of insecticide
   resistance, and correlated the behavioral responses with the activity of
   the insecticide deltamethrin. This analysis was performed at both the
   population and individual levels. There was significant variation in
   weevil `personality' among individuals and populations, but variation
   among individuals within populations accounted for most of the observed
   variation (92.57\%). This result emphasizes the importance of individual
   variation in behavioral and `personality' studies. When the behavioral
   traits assessed were correlated with median lethal time (LT50) at the
   population level and with the survival time under insecticide exposure,
   activity traits, particularly the distance walked, significantly
   increased survival time. Therefore, behavioral traits are important
   components of insecticide efficacy, and individual variation should be

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{According to theory in life-history and animal personality, individuals
   with high fitness expectations should be risk-averse, while individuals
   with low fitness expectations should be more bold. In female house mice,
   a selfish genetic element, the t haplotype, is associated with increased
   longevity under natural conditions, representing an appropriate case
   study to investigate this recent theory empirically. Following theory,
   females heterozygous for the t haplotype (+/t) are hypothesised to
   express more reactive personality traits and be more shy, less
   explorative and less active compared to the shorter-lived homozygous
   wildtype females (+/+). As males of different haplotype do not differ in
   survival, no similar pattern is expected. We tested these predictions by
   quantifying boldness, exploration, activity, and energetic intake in
   both +/t and +/+ mice. +/t females, unlike +/+ ones, expressed some
   reactive-like personality traits: +/t females were less active, less
   prone to form an exploratory routine and tended to ingest less food.
   Taken together these results suggest that differences in animal
   personality may contribute to the survival advantage observed in +/t
   females but fail to provide full empirical support for recent theory.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness is a personality trait that defines how individuals respond to
   risky situations and has clear fitness consequences. Since the adaptive
   value of boldness is context dependent, the benefit of a distinct
   personality is less clear when the environment is unpredictable. An
   ability to modulate behaviour can be beneficial, although as behavioural
   plasticity itself may be costly this depends on the levels of
   environmental stability. Both boldness and its plasticity are linked
   with physiological stress coping mechanisms, whereby animals with
   reduced glucocorticoid responses to stress are bolder and less flexible
   in behaviour. We investigated the behavioural changes made by bold and
   shy rainbow trout, and the magnitude of those changes, in response to
   predation risk and exposure to two environmental challenges. Behavioural
   and physiological responses under biotic (either no, predictable or
   unpredictable predation risk) and abiotic (temperature increase or
   hypoxia) factors were measured. Boldness was determined using a standard
   novel object paradigm. In general, after exposure to the treatments,
   fish exhibited less extreme bold or shy behaviour; the greatest change
   was observed in fish exposed to hypoxia, or those exposed to high risk
   particularly in shy fish held at a lower temperature. Higher risk also
   resulted in increased stress, suggesting that extreme bold or shy
   behaviour might have been maladaptive under a potential predator threat.
   These results represent novel evidence that boldness is flexible
   depending upon particular environmental challenges, with important
   implications for populations facing environmental extremes caused by
   anthropogenic activity and climate change. (C) 2013 The Association for

Title = {{Harnessing the power of personality assessment: subjective assessment
   predicts behaviour in horses}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{47-52}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective assessment of animal personality is typically time consuming,
   requiring the repeated measure of behavioural responses. By contrast,
   subjective assessment of personality allows information to be collected
   quickly by experienced caregivers. However, subjective assessment must
   predict behaviour to be valid. Comparisons of subjective assessments and
   behaviour have been made but often with methodological weaknesses and
   thus, limited success. Here we test the validity of a subjective
   assessment against a battery of behaviour tests in 146 horses (Equus
   caballus). Our first aim was to determine if subjective personality
   assessment could predict behaviour during behaviour testing. We made
   specific a priori predictions for how subjectively measured personality
   should relate to behaviour testing. We found that Extroversion predicted
   time to complete a handling test and refusal behaviour during this test.
   It also predicted minimum distance to a novel object. Neuroticism
   predicted how reactive an individual was to a sudden visual stimulus but
   not how quickly it recovered from this. Agreeableness did not predict
   any behaviour during testing. There were several unpredicted
   correlations between subjective measures and behaviour tests which we
   explore further. Our second aim was to combine data from the subjective
   assessment and behaviour tests to gain a more comprehensive
   understanding of personality. We found that the combination of methods
   provides new insights into horse behaviour. Furthermore, our data are
   consistent with the idea of horses showing different coping styles, a
   novel finding for this species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Sociobiol 66: 1543-1548, 2012; Garamszegi and Herczeg Behav Ecol
   Socibiol 66:1651-1658, 2012) deals with a core issue in animal
   personality research: Can animal personality research quantify
   correlated behaviors on the between-individual level, or is this too
   demanding in terms of design and analysis of the data, and should
   behavioral ecologists therefore take the ``individual gambit{''} and
   work on the phenotypic level only. Taking this gambit implies accepting
   that the between-individual correlation in behavioral traits (which is
   the correlation of interest) may be masked by a residual correlation of
   different magnitude or sign. Understanding (co)variances on different
   levels is the main thrust of quantitative genetics, and animal
   personality research can make good use of the plethora of ideas and
   analytical approaches developed in this field. I, here, outline reasons
   why the ``individual gambit{''} may or may not work out and its
   relationship to the quantitative genetic ``phenotypic gambit{''}. I
   especially emphasize the meaning of residuals and phenotypic plasticity
   which has not been fully appreciated in the debate thus far. I conclude
   that instead of a priori assuming that between-individual correlations
   are captured sufficiently well by the phenotypic correlation, animal
   personality researchers should set up more ambitious data collection and
   analysis designs to critically test this conjectured equality.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic noise can have serious implications for animals,
   especially when they communicate acoustically. Yet, the impacts of noise
   may depend not only on noise characteristics but also on an individual's
   coping style or personality. We tested whether noise is more disturbing
   if it masks communication signals, and whether characteristics of both
   the noise and the individual affect its impact. Using a unique
   population of personality-typed great tits, Parus major, we tested
   whether the kind of noise and parental personality affect parental
   nestbox visits and nestling begging. Nestboxes were exposed to automated
   noise playbacks, differing in spectral composition (noise masking
   begging calls, nonmasking noise or no noise). Parental nestbox visits
   were recorded using RFID transponders. Video and audio recordings were
   used to quantify nestling begging. Nestlings mainly begged in silence
   and in the presence of parents. Parents reduced nestbox visits during
   noise treatments regardless of the kind of noise and initially reacted
   more strongly to nonmasking noise. Moreover, slower explorers took
   longer to enter the nestbox during noise than faster explorers. Total
   visit rates during noise depended on parental sex and personality. In
   females, bolder individuals, but in males shyer individuals, reduced
   total visits during noise. These results extend previous findings in
   showing experimentally that the disturbance effects of noise do not
   depend on whether or not the noise directly interferes with information
   exchange by masking signals. Moreover, personality- and sex-specific
   responses to noise indicate that anthropogenic disturbance can
   differentially affect individuals within populations, which will
   influence mitigation strategies. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits are characterized by their labile expression:
   behavioural responses can, in principle, be up- and down-regulated in
   response to moment-to-moment changes in environmental conditions.
   Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population
   differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity.
   We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural
   plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic
   make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions
   natural selection might favour this form of between-individual
   variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the
   environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can
   promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how
   differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures
   induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual
   differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and
   evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We
   outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have
   knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can
   enhance the stability and persistence of populations. (c) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Behavioral type-environment correlations occur when specific behavioral
   types of individuals are more common in certain environments. Behavioral
   type-environment correlations can be generated by several different
   mechanisms that are probably very common such as niche construction and
   phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, behavioral type-environment
   correlations have important ecological and evolutionary implications.
   However, few studies have examined behavioral type-environment
   correlations in natural populations. In this study, we asked whether
   some behavioral types of three-spined stickleback were more likely to
   occur in certain social environments (alone or in a shoal with other
   stickleback) or in certain microhabitats in a river (in the open or
   under cover). We found that individuals that were in shoals with other
   stickleback at the time of collection from the field emerged from a
   refuge more quickly compared to individuals that were found alone. In
   addition, fish that were alone in an open microhabitat explored more of
   a pool compared to fish that were alone in cover, but this difference
   did not occur among fish that were in shoals at the time of collection.
   Subsequent analyses of gut contents suggested that differences in
   microhabitat use were consistent over time. Our study provides some of
   the first evidence for behavioral type-environment correlations in a
   natural population of non-human animals.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is much interest in behavioral syndromes, very little is
   known about how syndromes are generated in wild populations. Here, we
   assess the roles of correlated selection and divergent rearing
   environments in generating a syndrome between foraging aggressiveness
   and boldness in the spider Agelenopsis pennsylvanica. We first tested
   for and confirmed the presence of a behavioral syndrome between boldness
   and foraging aggressiveness in wild penultimate A.pennsylvanica
   (r=0.24). Then, to assess the effects of rearing environment on the
   boldnessaggressiveness syndrome, we compared the behavioral tendencies
   of field- vs. laboratory-reared spiders over the course of their
   development. The presence of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome
   differed based on spiders' developmental stage and rearing environment:
   field-reared juveniles did not exhibit a syndrome between boldness and
   foraging aggressiveness, but field-reared penultimates did. In contrast,
   laboratory-reared spiders never exhibited a behavioral syndrome,
   regardless of their developmental stage. Thus, the
   boldnessaggressiveness syndrome in A.pennsylvanica manifests only when
   individuals are reared in the field. Selection data from a markrecapture
   study failed to indicate any signature of correlated selection, despite
   our finding that at least one element of the syndrome (foraging
   aggressiveness) can respond to selection (Heritability h2=0.27, from
   mid-parent breeding study). Thus, contemporary correlated selection does
   not appear to be a major driver of the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome
   of A.pennsylvanica. Taken together, our data are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the boldnessaggressiveness syndrome exhibited by wild
   A.pennsylvanica develops as a result of environmentally induced
   phenotypic plasticity, and not correlated selection.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{650-658}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality is defined as behavior that is consistent across time
   and context. We here applied a reaction-norm perspective implemented as
   a random regression phenotypic model (RRPM) to behaviors measured on
   blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. During 3 consecutive breeding and winter
   seasons (2007-2009), a total of 508 wild-caught blue tits were assayed
   in a standard, artificial setup (a bird cage) for 1) activity, 2) time
   to escape, and 3) neophobia-related behavior. Activity was found to be
   repeatable both within and across seasonal contexts, but escape time and
   neophobia-related behavior were repeatable only in winter. Our RRPM
   confirmed that this latter finding was due to crossing of the
   individual-specific reaction norms between the 2 seasonal contexts. Our
   work illustrates how a behavior measured in a standardized manner may or
   may not be repeatable across time within a context but not between
   contexts, depending on the interindividual variation in reaction-norm
   properties. Our findings suggest that research on animal behavior
   plasticity can benefit from taking onboard context-specific analyses in
   a more explicit manner than what is typically done.}},

Title = {{Can We Predict Personality in Fish? Searching for Consistency over Time
   and across Contexts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The interest in animal personality, broadly defined as consistency of
   individual behavioural traits over time and across contexts, has
   increased dramatically over the last years. Individual differences in
   behaviour are no longer recognised as noise around a mean but rather as
   adaptive variation and thus, essentially, raw material for evolution.
   Animal personality has been considered evolutionary conserved and has
   been shown to be present in all vertebrates including fish. Despite the
   importance of evolutionary and comparative aspects in this field, few
   studies have actually documented consistency across situations in fish.
   In addition, most studies are done with individually housed fish which
   may pose additional challenges when interpreting data from social
   species. Here, we investigate, for the first time in fish, whether
   individual differences in behavioural responses to a variety of
   challenges are consistent over time and across contexts using both
   individual and grouped-based tests. Twenty-four juveniles of Gilthead
   seabream Sparus aurata were subjected to three individual-based tests:
   feed intake recovery in a novel environment, novel object and
   restraining and to two group-based tests: risk-taking and hypoxia. Each
   test was repeated twice to assess consistency of behavioural responses
   over time. Risk taking and escape behaviours during restraining were
   shown to be significantly consistent over time. In addition, consistency
   across contexts was also observed: individuals that took longer to
   recover feed intake after transfer into a novel environment exhibited
   higher escape attempts during a restraining test and escaped faster from
   hypoxia conditions. These results highlight the possibility to predict
   behaviour in groups from individual personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality has been widely documented across a range of species.
   The concept of personality is composed of individual behavioural
   consistency across time and between situations, and also behavioural
   trait correlations known as behavioural syndromes. Whilst many studies
   have now investigated the stability of individual personality traits,
   few have analysed the stability over time of entire behavioural
   syndromes. Here we present data from a behavioural study of rock pool
   prawns. We show that prawns are temporally consistent in a range of
   behaviours, including activity, exploration and boldness, and also that
   a behavioural syndrome is evident in this population. We find
   correlations between many behavioural traits (activity, boldness,
   shoaling and exploration). In addition, behavioural syndrome structure
   was consistent over time. Finally, few studies have explicitly studied
   the role of sex differences in personality traits, behavioural
   consistency and syndrome structure. We report behavioural differences
   between male and female prawns but no differences in patterns of
   consistency. Our study adds to the growing literature on animal
   personality, and provides evidence showing that syndromes themselves can
   exhibit temporal consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has accumulated within the last decade that
   individuals of different animal species show consistent behavior both
   across various contexts and through time, that is, they do have
   personality. However, little is known in how far the environment an
   individual is facing may influence the personality of insects, whereas
   it is well established that the environment can have profound influences
   on performance parameters. The development of personality may be closely
   linked to different expectations in future fitness leading to
   contrasting life-history strategies. We investigated in how far the
   environmental food conditions experienced during lifetime influence the
   life-history and shape the personality of the mustard leaf beetle,
   Phaedon cochleariae, a pest of crucifers. Beetles reared on low-quality
   food developed slower and gained lower body masses than insects reared
   on high-quality food. By performing behavioral tests analogous to
   vertebrate assays repeatedly during adult life, we identified 3
   personality dimensions, boldness, activity, and nontargeted
   explorativeness. Comparing food-dependent differences of the personality
   dimensions with state-dependent differences of the expected future
   prospects, we found that beetles feeding low-quality food were bolder,
   thereby potentially increasing their capabilities to succeed in
   foraging. In contrast, animals feeding high-quality food were more
   active. Changes in boldness may be highly adaptive to increase future
   reproductive output, whereas activity is likely constrained by the
   energy uptake. Our results demonstrate that the environment does not
   only affect life-history traits but has also a consistent impact on an
   individual's behavior, which is likely highly adaptive.}},

Abstract = {{Although there has been an increase in fend personality research, much
   more work is needed, with only 20 published studies, 17 of which focused
   on the domestic cat. Most studies show important implications for this
   type of research, but there is no consensus on terminology, method, or
   conclusions for felids, even at the species level. Felid personality
   research comes from various fields, and is often carried out with
   different methods, with diverse goals. This review evaluates the
   published research on felid personality, and addresses its reliability
   and validity. Only 60\% of the studies reported reliability estimates,
   and these varied greatly across personality dimensions. The sample
   weighted mean correlation of the reliability estimates was 0.68 (based
   on three studies). Fifty-five percent of the studies assessed validity.
   The personality dimensions with the highest validity for all species
   were Sociable, Dominant, and Curious, with a mean correlation of 0.82.
   Recommendations for future research and implications for aiding in
   conservation and captive animal management efforts and improving health

Abstract = {{How different levels of biological organization interact to shape each
   other's function is a central question in biology. One particularly
   important topic in this context is how individuals' variation in
   behaviour shapes group-level characteristics. We investigated how fish
   that express different locomotory behaviour in an asocial context move
   collectively when in groups. First, we established that individual fish
   have characteristic, repeatable locomotion behaviours (i.e. median
   speeds, variance in speeds and median turning speeds) when tested on
   their own. When tested in groups of two, four or eight fish, we found
   individuals partly maintained their asocial median speed and median
   turning speed preferences, while their variance in speed preference was
   lost. The strength of this individuality decreased as group size
   increased, with individuals conforming to the speed of the group, while
   also decreasing the variability in their own speed. Further, individuals
   adopted movement characteristics that were dependent on what group size
   they were in. This study therefore shows the influence of social context
   on individual behaviour. If the results found here can be generalized
   across species and contexts, then although individuality is not entirely
   lost in groups, social conformity and group-size-dependent effects drive
   how individuals will adjust their behaviour in groups.}},

Abstract = {{One aspect of animal personality that has been well described in
   captivity, but received only little attention in studies in the wild, is
   that personality types may vary in their behavioural flexibility towards
   environmental changes. A fundamental factor underlying such differences
   is believed to be the degree to which individual behavior is guided by
   environmental stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in the wild using
   free-ranging great tits. Personality variation was quantified using
   exploratory behaviour in a novel environment, which has previously been
   shown to be repeatable and correlated with other behaviours in this and
   other populations of the same species. By temporarily removing food at
   feeding stations we examined whether birds with different personality
   differed in returning to visit empty feeders as this may provide
   information on how birds continue to sample their environment after a
   sudden change in conditions. In two summer experiments, we found that
   fast-exploring juveniles visited empty feeders less often compared to
   slow-exploring juveniles. In winter, sampling behaviour was sex
   dependent but not related to personality. In both seasons, we found that
   birds who sampled empty feeders more often were more likely to
   rediscover food after we again re-baited the feeding stations, but there
   was no effect of personality. Our results show that personality types
   may indeed differ in ways of collecting environmental information, which
   is consistent with the view of personalities as different styles of
   coping with environmental changes. The adaptive value of these
   alternative behavioural tactics, however, needs to be further explored.}},

Volume = {{150}},

Abstract = {{Sexual cannibalism is often hypothesized to be an extreme manifestation
   of sexual conflict, yet we still lack a good understanding of the
   underlying motivation in most species. Hypotheses for the ultimate
   causes of sexual cannibalism either invoke the behavior as adaptive
   ormal-adaptive. Adaptive hypotheses consider foraging decisions, mate
   choice or genetic bet-hedging. Mal-adaptive hypotheses propose that
   sexual cannibalism is the result of mistaken species identity or the by
   product of an aggression syndrome. Here, we test the latter hypothesis,
   that sexual cannibalism is the result of an aggression syndrome. This
   hypothesis states that aggressive behavior is favored in the foraging
   context because females benefit from achieving a large size quickly
   through an increase in fecundity, and it predicts that individuals that
   are aggressive foragers are more likely to attack a male and hence are
   at risk of receiving no or insufficient quantities of sperm. Few tests
   of this hypothesis are available to date, and only one involved a
   species with sexual cannibalism occurring after at least some sperm
   transfer. We test the hypothesis in Argiope aurantia, a species in which
   females frequently attack males during copulation. We estimated
   aggressiveness in the foraging context in penultimate and adults females
   and staged matings using the same females to evaluate whether
   aggressiveness during the foraging context predicts the likelihood of
   sexual cannibalism. Indeed, we find that aggressive foragers are more
   likely to attack their mates, but we conclude that other, possibly
   adaptive reasons for cannibalism exist as much of the uncertainty in
   cannibalism occurrence remained unexplained.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic plasticity of labile traits in the wild}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{485-505}},
Abstract = {{Individual-based studies allow quantification of phenotypic plasticity
   in behavioural, life-history and other labile traits. The study of
   phenotypic plasticity in the wild can shed new light on the ultimate
   objectives (1) whether plasticity itself can evolve or is constrained by
   its genetic architecture, and (2) whether plasticity is associated to
   other traits, including fitness (selection). I describe the main
   statistical approach for how repeated records of individuals and a
   description of the environment (E) allow quantification of variation in
   plasticity across individuals (IxE) and genotypes (GxE) in wild
   populations. Based on a literature review of life-history and
   behavioural studies on plasticity in the wild, I discuss the present
   state of the two objectives listed above. Few studies have quantified
   GxE of labile traits in wild populations, and it is likely that power to
   detect statistically significant GxE is lacking. Apart from the issue of
   whether it is heritable, plasticity tends to correlate with average
   trait expression (not fully supported by the few genetic estimates
   available) and may thus be evolutionary constrained in this way.
   Individual-specific estimates of plasticity tend to be related to other
   traits of the individual (including fitness), but these analyses may be
   anti-conservative because they predominantly concern stats-on-stats.
   Despite the increased interest in plasticity in wild populations, the
   putative lack of power to detect GxE in such populations hinders
   achieving general insights. I discuss possible steps to invigorate the
   field by moving away from simply testing for presence of GxE to analyses
   that `scale up' to population level processes and by the development of
   new behavioural theory to identify quantitative genetic parameters which
   can be estimated.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{799-811}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that repeated assays of behaviour, conducted
   both within and across situations, could reveal important insights into
   two traditionally distinct areas of study: animal personality and
   individual differences in behavioural plasticity. However, at present
   relatively few studies present such data, and few consider how changing
   abiotic conditions affect behavioural plasticity. Individual differences
   in metabolic rate have been suggested as a proximate mechanism promoting
   personality, leading one to speculate that individual differences in
   metabolic sensitivity to temperature may affect behavioural responses in
   ectotherms. At present, only one study (out of two) has tested for and
   shown individual differences in behavioural responses to temperature.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed the behaviour of a marine crab across a
   narrow range of temperatures to test for individual differences in
   responses to temperature. We observed large inter-individual differences
   in behaviour that were consistent over time at a given temperature
   (evidence for personality), and individual differences in responses to
   temperature (evidence for plasticity). This study adds to the very scant
   literature on ectotherm behavioural sensitivity to temperature, and
   suggests the phenomenon might be widespread. We speculate about the role
   of metabolism as a proximate mechanism that might explain these
   individual differences in plasticity and make suggestions for future
   research to test this hypothesis.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest among behavioral ecologists in behavioral
   syndromes and animal personality. Studies of behavioral syndromes
   repeatedly measure the same individuals to quantify within-individual
   consistency and between-individual variation in behavior. Often these
   studies measure behavior in different contexts or in different
   behavioral assays to determine whether individual differences in
   behavior in one context are related to behavior in other contexts, that
   is, if there is a behavioral syndrome. For studies of behavioral
   syndromes, there is not universal agreement about whether it is
   preferable to randomize the order of different assays or to administer
   them in a fixed order. Here, I articulate the advantages and
   disadvantages of testing in a randomized or fixed order and offer some
   recommendations according to the goals and power of the experiment. In
   general, studies using within-subjects designs that are primarily
   interested in mean-level differences between treatments should randomize
   the order that individuals experience different treatments. Under
   certain conditions, studies of behavioral syndromes should also
   administer the assays in a randomized order, but only if the study is
   sufficiently powerful to statistically account for carryover and period
   effects. If the experimenter is interested in behavioral syndromes that
   are caused by carryovers, it is often preferable to test in a fixed
   order. If the experimenter wants to guard against carryovers, but the
   experiment is not sufficiently powerful to account for carryover and
   period effects, then a compromise is to test in a fixed order, but to
   test individuals in the context that is most likely to affect subsequent
   behavior last.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in behavioral responses to environmental conditions and
   biological interactions are a key determinant of individual performance.
   This study investigated how the availability and predictability of food
   resources modulates the growth of animals that adopt different
   behavioral strategies. Results show that, irrespective of the feeding
   regime, the growth of juvenile brown trout increased with the expression
   of active foraging behavior and, similarly, with increasing use of
   shelter. Conversely, territorial aggressive behavior only promoted
   growth when food resources Were spatially and temporally predictable,
   and only for individuals that had high metabolic rates (when compared
   with their low metabolic rate siblings). Thus, this study shows that
   only certain behaviors are associated with variation in the physiology
   of individuals. Moreover, only certain behaviors associate differently
   with growth under different environmental conditions. These results are
   partially consistent with the hypothesis that environmental variability
   promotes the coexistence of alternative behavioral phenotypes. However,
   some behaviors enhanced growth irrespective of feeding regime, and we
   did not identify a set of conditions where fish with low resting
   metabolic rate (RMR) outperformed their high RMR siblings. Hence,
   additional layers of environmental variation are likely to be required
   for individuals with low RMR to show maximal growth performance.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting species range expansions is an important
   challenge in modern ecology because of rapidly changing environments.
   Recent studies have revealed that consistent within-species variation in
   behavior (i.e., animal personality) can be imperative for dispersal
   success, a key process in range expansion. Here we investigate how
   habitat isolation can mediate differentiation of personality traits
   between recently founded island populations and the main population. We
   performed laboratory studies of boldness and exploration across life
   stages (tadpoles and froglets) using four isolated island populations
   and four mainland populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria). Both
   tadpoles and froglets from isolated populations were bolder and more
   exploratory than conspecifics from the mainland. Although the pattern
   can be influenced by possible differences in predation pressure, we
   suggest that this behavioral differentiation might be the result of a
   disperser-dependent founder effect brought on by an isolation-driven
   environmental filtering of animal personalities. These findings can have
   important implications for both species persistence in the face of
   climate change (i.e., range expansions) and ecological invasions as well
   as for explaining rapid speciation in isolated patches.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of the same species differ consistently in risky actions.
   Such `animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural
   flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that
   between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve
   if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with
   high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should
   behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower
   expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness
   expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky
   behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested
   this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed
   adjust their `exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour,
   to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus
   major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival
   probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking
   behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability.
   We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic
   effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive
   personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key
   prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history
   trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution
   of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future
   fitness expectations.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Exploration on the Use of Producer-Scrounger Tactics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Individuals foraging in groups can use two different tactics for
   obtaining food resources. Individuals can either search for food sources
   themselves (producing) or they can join food discoveries of others
   (scrounging). In this study we use a genetic algorithm in a spatially
   explicit producer-scrounger game to explore how individuals compromise
   between exploration (an important axis of animal personality) and
   scrounging and how characteristics of the environment affect this
   compromise. Agents varied in exploration and scrounging and a genetic
   algorithm searched for the optimal combination of exploration and
   scrounging. The foraging environments featured different levels of patch
   richness, predation and patch density. Our simulations show that under
   conditions of low patch densities slow exploring scroungers were favored
   whereas high patch density favored fast exploring individuals that
   either produced (at low patch richness) or scrounged (at high patch
   richness). In high predation environments fast exploring individuals
   were selected for but only at low to intermediate patch densities.
   Predation did not affect scrounging behavior. We did not find a
   divergence of exploration `types' within a given environment, but there
   was a general association between exploration and scrounging across
   different environments: high rates of scrounging were observed over
   nearly the full spectrum of exploration values, whereas high rates of
   producing were only observed at high exploration values, suggesting that
   cases in which slow explorers start producing should be rare. Our
   results indicate that the spatial arrangement of food resources can
   affect the optimal social attraction rules between agents, the
   optimality of foraging tactic and the interaction between both.}},

   Performance Correlates to Proactive-Reactive Behavioural Types}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behaviour, indicative of
   behavioural types or personalities, have been shown in taxa ranging from
   Cnidaria to Mammalia. However, despite numerous theoretical explanations
   there remains limited empirical evidence for selective mechanisms that
   maintain such variation within natural populations. We examined
   behavioural types and fitness proxies in wild female grey seals at the
   North Rona breeding colony. Experiments in 2009 and 2010 employed a
   remotely-controlled vehicle to deliver a novel auditory stimulus to
   females to elicit changes in pup-checking behaviour. Mothers tested
   twice during lactation exhibited highly repeatable individual
   pup-checking rates within and across breeding seasons. Observations of
   undisturbed mothers (i.e. experiencing no disturbance from conspecifics
   or experimental test) also revealed CIDs in pup-checking behaviour.
   However, there was no correlation between an individuals' pup-checking
   rate during undisturbed observations with the rate in response to the
   auditory test, indicating plasticity across situations. The extent to
   which individuals changed rates of pup-checking from undisturbed to
   disturbed conditions revealed a continuum of behavioural types from
   proactive females, who maintained a similar rate throughout, to reactive
   females, who increased pup-checking markedly in response to the test.
   Variation in maternal expenditure (daily mass loss rate) was greater
   among more reactive mothers than proactive mothers. Consequently pups of
   more reactive mothers had more varied growth rates centred around the
   long-term population mean. These patterns could not be accounted for by
   other measured covariates as behavioural type was unrelated to a
   mother's prior experience, degree of inter-annual site fidelity,
   physical characteristics of their pupping habitat, pup sex or pup
   activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that
   variation in behavioural types is maintained by spatial and temporal
   environmental variation combined with limits to phenotype-environment
   matching.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{There is a surging interest in the evolution, ecology and physiology of
   personality differences. However, most of the studies in this research
   area have been performed in adult animals. Trait variations expressed
   early in development and how they are related to the ontogeny of an
   animal's personality are far less studied. Genetic differences as well
   as environmental factors causing functional variability of the central
   serotonergic system have been related to personality differences in
   vertebrates, including humans. Such gene-environment interplay suggests
   that the central serotonergic system plays an important role in the
   ontogeny of personality traits. In salmonid fishes, the timing of
   emergence from spawning nests is related to energy reserves, aggression,
   and social dominance. However, it is currently unknown how the size of
   the yolk reserve is reflected on aggression and dominance, or if these
   traits are linked to differences in serotonergic transmission in newly
   emerged larvae. In this study we investigated the relationship between
   yolk reserves, social dominance, and serotonergic transmission in newly
   emerged rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae. This was conducted
   by allowing larvae with the same emergence time, but with different yolk
   sizes, to interact in pairs for 24 h. The results show that individuals
   with larger yolks performed more aggressive acts, resulting in a
   suppression of aggression in individuals with smaller yolks. A higher
   brain serotonergic activity confirmed subordination in larvae with small
   yolks. The relationship between social dominance and yolk size was
   present in siblings, demonstrating a link between interfamily variation
   in energy reserves and aggression, and suggests that larger yolk
   reserves fuel a more aggressive personality during the initial
   territorial establishment in salmonid fishes. Furthermore, socially
   naive larvae with big yolks had lower serotonin levels, suggesting that
   other factors than the social environment causes variation in
   serotonergic transmission, underlying individual variation in aggressive
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the manner by which individual differences in personality
   arise and are maintained in animal populations is currently a topic of
   considerable research interest. This is particularly the case when it
   comes to developmental processes and understanding how behaviors change
   over ontogeny. Such developmental perspectives are essential given that
   the vast majority of animal species possess complex life cycles or
   undergo some form of metamorphosis. Yet, in spite of the broad taxonomic
   relevance and the obvious potential importance of metamorphosis for
   understanding the basis of consistency in personality over ontogeny,
   almost no research has been done on this topic. Using the lake frog
   (Rana ridibunda) as a study organism, we tested whether individual-level
   differences in personality (activity, exploration and boldness) were
   consistent within both larval and juvenile frog life-history stages and
   across metamorphosis. We found that most behaviors of interest were
   highly consistent within a given life-history stage and at least some
   traits were consistent across metamorphosis (e. g., activity and
   exploration). Generally, more active, exploratory individuals in novel
   experimental arenas were also bolder and more likely to spend time in
   more risky open areas of a familiar environment. To our knowledge, our
   study is the first to both characterize personality traits across anuran

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in the environment favours foragers that are flexible
   (phenotypically plastic). However, consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (personality), such as in risk-taking, might affect an
   individual's ability to find food, avoid predators and adjust to new
   conditions. It is now well known that personalities exist in many taxa,
   but much less is known about individual variation in plasticity. We
   measured the tendency to begin foraging across different levels of risk
   in house sparrows (Passer domesticus), using a behavioural reaction norm
   framework to simultaneously assess personality and plasticity. We asked
   whether individuals were consistently different across risk levels, and
   whether they differed in habituation and neophobia, both of which were
   treated as cases of plasticity. We found that males habituated more than
   females by beginning to feed sooner after repeated instances of a human
   disturbance in the presence of an initially unfamiliar object.
   Individuals of both sexes also exhibited consistent differences across
   trials, but did not differ in the rate of habituation beyond the
   difference between the sexes. When a novel object was placed in the
   foraging area, both sexes exhibited similar degrees of neophobia by
   delaying feeding. The magnitude of this change varied among birds,
   indicating individual differences in neophobia. Our results indicate
   that both personality and individual variation in plasticity exist but
   should be treated as independent phenomena. The presence of variation in
   plasticity implies that the raw material necessary for selection on
   neophobia exists, and that if heritable, plasticity in risk-taking
   across contexts could evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the
   life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to
   travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in
   dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g.
   specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar
   reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive
   abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl
   is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many
   physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress
   response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is
   also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site
   to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one
   breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set.
   Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during
   natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering
   experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents
   had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by
   parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and
   breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating
   that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled
   in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might
   be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to
   explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration
   and natal dispersal. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Animal personalities have become an established concept in animal
   behaviour. Despite this, the potential influence of early life
   experiences on adult personality is often overlooked. Juvenile exposure
   to environmental cues such as conspecific signalling or predator cues
   may provide relevant information regarding the make-up of the
   forthcoming environment. Individuals might be able to use these cues to
   adjust developmental trajectory and adult personality to prevent a
   personality-environment mismatch. Using the field cricket Gryllus
   integer, we show that individuals reared in the presence of conspecific
   acoustic sexual signals alter both growth rate and an adult personality
   trait. Males reared in the presence of acoustic sexual signals were less
   aggressive and less likely to become dominant relative to those reared
   in the absence of acoustic signals. Additionally, acoustic treatment
   interacted with juvenile body mass: large juveniles reared in the
   presence of acoustic signals were larger than small juveniles reared in
   the presence of acoustic signals and larger than all juveniles reared in
   silence. We discuss the potential adaptive significance of the observed
   developmental and personality differences. (C) 2012 The Association for

Abstract = {{Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that
   may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually
   an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially
   generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may
   be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates
   or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been
   studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive
   propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in
   the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an
   established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four
   fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we
   analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible
   mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates)
   according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression
   levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural
   idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant
   position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social
   interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected
   by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this
   experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating
   effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types
   and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies
   this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social
   contexts, especially in highly social species. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{There is much interest in studying animal personalities but considerable
   debate as to how to define and evaluate them. We assessed the utility of
   one proposed framework while studying personality in terrestrial hermit
   crabs (Coenobita clypeatus). We recorded the latency of individuals to
   emerge from their shells over multiple trials in four unique
   manipulations. We used the specific testing situations within these
   manipulations to define two temperament categories (shyness-boldness and
   exploration-avoidance). Our results identified individual behavioral
   consistency (i.e., personality) across repeated trials of the same
   situations, within both categories. Additionally, we found correlations
   between behaviors across contexts (traits) that suggested that the crabs
   had behavioral syndromes. While we found some correlations between
   behaviors that are supposed to measure the same temperament trait, these
   correlations were not inevitable. Furthermore, a principal component
   analysis (PCA) of our data revealed new relationships between behaviors
   and provided the foundation for an alternate interpretation: measured
   behaviors may be situation-specific, and may not reflect general
   personality traits at all. These results suggest that more attention
   must be placed on how we infer personalities from standardized methods,
   and that we must be careful to not force our data to fit our frameworks.

Abstract = {{Assessing behavioural consistency is crucial to understand the evolution
   of personality traits. In the present study, we examined the short- and
   long-term repeatability and stability of two unrelated personality
   traits exploratory tendencies and struggling rate using captive female
   zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata). We performed two experimental
   sessions of behavioural tests with a 7-mo interval, which represents up
   to one quarter of a zebra finch's life expectancy. We showed that,
   overall, exploratory tendencies and struggling rate were significantly
   repeatable in the short term. However, only exploratory tendencies were
   repeatable in the long term. We found interindividual differences in
   short-term stability of exploratory tendencies, but not struggling rate,
   providing evidence for differences in intraindividual variability. In
   the long term, struggling rate significantly decreased between the two
   experimental sessions, whereas exploratory tendencies remained stable.
   Finally, the amount of interindividual variation measured at both
   sessions did not differ. Our results suggest that short- and long-term
   repeatability and stability of personality may vary between individuals,
   depending on the behavioural trait under scrutiny. As a consequence,
   deducing personality from measures realized earlier in a subject's life
   should be performed with caution. We discuss the implications of inter-
   and intraindividual variation in personality consistency on individual
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Colour polymorphism is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrates and has
   often been linked with differences in behaviour such as aggression or
   boldness, behaviours that are often part of personality traits in
   monomorphic species. However, up to now, very few studies have looked
   whether colour morphs just differ in average behaviour or whether
   specific combinations of behaviours are favoured in relation to a
   particular morph therefore signalling personality traits. This was
   tested in the highly social and polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura
   gouldiae). Tests were performed in pairs of a red-headed and a
   black-headed individual of same sex and size but different age. Capture
   rank in the aviary as well as latency to feed beside a novel object
   (neophobia) and to approach and touch a novel object on a perch
   (neophilia) were measured. For neophobia and neophilia, ranks of
   latencies calculated across all individuals were used and general and
   within-pair comparisons were made. Neophobia and approach neophilia were
   consistent over time (2 similar to mo), and approach neophilia was
   positively correlated with capture rank and neophobia indicating that
   the behaviours are part of personality traits. Moreover, black-headed
   birds generally approached the novel object earlier than red-headed
   birds. Similarly, within pairs, black-headed birds were first to
   approach the novel object and were also captured first. Relative age
   (younger or older than the partner) was related to neophobia and tactile
   neophilia ranks; older birds reacted faster. The results indicate that
   colour morphs not only differ in average behaviour but that specific
   combinations of behaviours are related to colour morphs suggesting that
   head colours signal personality traits. Furthermore, depending on age
   individuals may have different roles in a social network.}},

Abstract = {{Boldness in animal personality studies is measured using a range of
   different behavioural assays, including responses to novel objects,
   novel environments and threatening stimuli. These assays should be
   correlated if they all reflect boldness, but this assumption has rarely
   been tested. We investigated experimentally whether presentation of
   threatening stimuli (a taxidermic puff adder, Bitis arietans arietans)
   and novel object (an unfamiliar food item) both assayed the same
   personality trait in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We recorded
   individual responses to both the snake model and novel foods for 57
   baboons encompassing all age-sex classes in two study troops over 3
   years. Surprisingly, those individuals that showed the greatest alarm
   responses to the model snake, that is, the least bold responses, also
   inspected it for longer. Furthermore, individuals' threat responses did
   not correlate with their response to the novel food. Thus, boldness
   according to one definition was not related to boldness using another
   definition. We suggest that threat-directed behaviours did not reflect
   individual boldness, but instead were indicative of another personality
   dimension: anxiety. These findings highlight that current boldness
   assays may not be interchangeable, and in some cases may not measure
   boldness at all. We stress the value of using multiple assays to measure
   the personality trait of interest. (C) 2012 The Association for the

   speed with which colonies retrieved food and removed debris. Colonies
   differed consistently, across foraging and disturbance situations, in
   both responsiveness and speed. Increased activity in response to food
   was associated with a smaller decrease in response to alarm. Speed of
   retrieving food was correlated with speed of removing debris. In all
   colonies, speed was greater in dry conditions, reducing the amount of
   time ants spent outside the nest. While a colony occupied a certain nest
   site, its responsiveness was consistent in both foraging and disturbance
   situations, suggesting that nest structure influences colony

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits are often plastic and can allow animals important
   flexibility when environmental conditions vary. However, studies of
   animal personality suggest that behaviour can be `constrained' to
   certain behavioural types, leading to consistent differences between
   individuals. Few studies have investigated the interaction between
   personality traits and the need for flexibility in individuals over
   different, naturally occurring situations in the wild. We investigated
   whether free-living Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, were
   constrained by personality types or showed behavioural plasticity when
   their environmental conditions changed dramatically between the dry and
   rainy seasons. We examined three key behaviours: risk taking as measured
   by flight initiation distance, time budgets focusing on time spent
   conspicuous and rates of signalling directed at conspecifics.
   Risk-taking behaviour of males showed stable between-individual
   differences, but no between-individual differences in plasticity,
   supporting previous evidence that antipredator behaviour is determined
   by personality in this species. Time spent conspicuous showed a response
   to season, and an interaction between the individual and season,
   suggesting that behavioural plasticity itself may be a personality
   trait. In contrast, signalling behaviour changed in response to season
   but did not vary consistently between individuals. We suggest that where
   there are reliable environmental cues, individual plasticity will be
   favoured over consistency in the relevant behaviours. (C) 2012 The

   Behavioural Response across Species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Animal personality, repeatable behaviour through time and across
   contexts, is ecologically and evolutionarily important as it can account
   for the exhibition of sub-optimal behaviours. Interspecific comparisons
   have been suggested as important for understanding the evolution of
   animal personality; however, these are seldom accomplished due, in part,
   to the lack of statistical tools for quantifying differences and
   similarities in behaviour between groups of individuals. We used nine
   species of closely-related coral reef fishes to investigate the
   usefulness of ecological community analyses for the analysis of
   between-species behavioural differences and behavioural heterogeneity.
   We first documented behavioural carryover across species by observing
   the fishes' behaviour and measuring their response to a threatening
   stimulus to quantify boldness. Bold fish spent more time away from the
   reef and fed more than shy fish. We then used ecological community
   analysis tools (canonical variate analysis, multi-response permutation
   procedure, and permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion) and
   identified four `clusters' of behaviourally similar fishes, and found
   that the species differ in the behavioural variation expressed; some
   species are more behaviourally heterogeneous than others. We found that
   ecological community analysis tools are easily and fruitfully applied to
   comparative studies of personality and encourage their use by future
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling
   phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain
   intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour,
   which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations.
   Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main
   life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual
   differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals
   of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using
   open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity,
   exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found
   systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different
   residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high
   expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high
   current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age.
   Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body
   condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal
   variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction might maintain personality
   variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this
   life-history trade-off hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals in most animal groups exhibit consistent behavioural
   differences across situations or over time known as behavioural
   syndromes. We conducted a study with a herd of young rangeland-raised
   cows to determine whether animals exhibited consistent differences in
   foraging behaviours across contexts (confinement vs. rangeland pasture)
   and could be clustered into behavioural type groups on the basis of a
   suite of correlated behaviours. We also investigated whether cows with
   different behavioural types performed differently in this environment.
   Supplement consumption rate (SCR) in confinement was used to select two
   groups of cows (fast eaters vs. slow eaters). This classification was
   validated by measuring the persistence of SCR differences through time,
   conducting cluster analysis to classify individuals into two behavioural
   types (BT1 and BT2) on the basis of a suite of 14 behavioural,
   physiological, and performance predictors, and comparing serum cortisol
   concentrations of cows in either group. Discriminant and linear
   correlation analyses were used to assess the influence of behavioural
   and performance responses on the classification of cows, and to study
   the relationships between behaviour and animal performance. Thirty-three
   young cows were tracked with GPS collars for approximately 45 days
   during the calving seasons 01 2006 and 2007 and several performance
   responses were measured on each individual. Cows classified as
   exhibiting BT1 had significantly higher (P <= 0.05) SCR (mean +/- SE
   2006: 1.90 +/- 0.1; 2007: 2.54 +/- 0.1 g/s) and serum cortisol (SC)
   concentrations (8.8 +/- 0.88 ng/mL) than BT2 counterparts (SCR 2006:
   0.32 +/- 0.03 g/s; SCR 2007: 1.59 +/- 0.1 g/s; SC: 5.5 +/- 0.5 ng/mL).
   Compared to BT2 cows, BT1 individuals tended to spend less time at water
   (BT1 : 73 +/- 10; BT2: 172 +/- 16 min/day), cover larger areas (BT1, :
   21 +/- 0.3; BT2: 17 +/- 2 ha/day), and exhibit less concentrated search
   patterns (BT1: 264 +/- 8.9; BT2: 314 +/- 2 Gm travelled/(ha
   covered/day)). BT1 individuals tended to be heavier (BT1 : 434 +/- 7;
   BT2: 394 +/- 10 kg) and began gaining weight sooner after calving (BT1 :
   44 +/- 3; BT2: 69 +/- 6 days). Cows exhibiting BT1 were more abundant in
   the herd and appeared to perform better in the rangeland environment
   where we conducted the study. Further research is needed to determine
   the constraints imposed by this behavioural syndrome on animal
   performance in other feeding environments. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Exploration of the environment is a key behaviour in animals. The
   exploratory behaviour of species or populations depends on different
   aspects of their ecology. New evidence suggests that differences in
   exploratory behaviour might also be related to life history strategies,
   with fast-lived animals (high metabolic rate, short life span) being
   faster explorers than slow-lived ones. We tested this assumption in
   shrews. Shrews are divided into two phylogenetic groups, which differ
   tremendously in life history. We compared the exploratory behaviour of
   three species, covering both phylogenetic groups. Shrews of the
   fast-lived genus Sorex were quicker to start exploration and to locate
   the first food patch. They also moved faster than the slow-lived genus
   Crocidura. Unlike many studies on exploratory behaviour that analyse
   only a short period of time (i.e. a single exploration bout with a fixed
   duration), we analysed the species-specific allocation of prolonged
   total exploration time into exploration bouts. Using this method, we
   could show that Sorex performed more, but shorter exploration bouts than
   Crocidura. Our results support the hypothesis of exploratory behaviour
   being related to life history. While the species we tested occur
   sympatrically, the two genera differ strongly in the climatic zones they
   inhabit. It is likely that also during evolution they faced different
   types of habitat and thus different selection pressures. These
   differences in evolutionary histories possibly favoured the evolution of
   their diversified life histories and exploration strategies. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Consistent behavioural differences have long been recognized in animals
   but it still remains unclear how these traits change over ontogeny. As
   individuals can face different situations over their lives, and their
   life history expectation may not be the same in different life stages,
   one can expect that using different strategies in different life stages
   would be advantageous. Characteristics of animal personality across
   ontogeny could be measured at group and individual levels. Since
   personality alteration across time can be studied from various aspects
   one should use the following indexes: mean-level, differential,
   structural and individual consistency. We investigated whether common
   firebugs behave in the same way through a major life stage transition,
   namely final ecdysis. We measured activity, boldness and exploration
   twice in the larval stage and also twice when bugs reached the adult
   stage. We found that the relative value of behavioural traits was stable
   across ontogeny and the correlation structure among behavioural traits
   remained constant over time. Nevertheless, larvae differed from adults
   in general in that they were bolder, explored their environment more
   thoroughly and seemed to be more active before final ecdysis. These
   results indicate that personality could change differently across major
   life stage transitions; therefore this important factor needs to be
   considered in further research. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{In recent years, using a personality approach for studies of animal
   behaviour has increased our ability to predict an individual's or
   population's behavioural responses to external stimuli. At a population
   level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and
   the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across
   different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a
   predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced
   changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural
   type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether
   exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural
   syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness.
   We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally
   different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or
   contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural
   antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing
   (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types
   expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e.
   shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However,
   an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in
   either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses
   were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that
   individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased
   predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and
   that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{Flight initiation distances (FIDs) of animals approached by a potential
   predator provide information about the risk that individuals are willing
   to take given their state and the environment. Species differ in mean
   and variance in FID, suggesting that species with a large variance in
   FID have individuals that take either small or great risks, whereas
   species with a small variance are composed of individuals that are
   homogeneous in their risk-taking behavior. Here, we investigate the
   correlations between interspecific variance in risk-taking behavior and
   habitat selection, breeding range and population size, dispersal, and
   life history. Greater between individual variation in risk-taking
   behavior for a given average level of risk taking would imply that more
   different habitats could be exploited, resulting in larger local and
   global population sizes and larger ranges. There should be a link
   between dispersal distances and FID because individuals of risk-averse
   species should encounter greater difficulties of finding suitable
   breeding habitats. High local and global population sizes should select
   for fast life histories with early age at first reproduction, high
   annual fecundity, low juvenile survival, and fast rates of senescence in
   species with variable FIDs. Finally, a greater diversity of habitat use
   should select for a longer reproductive season in species with more
   variable FIDs. Analyses of FIDs for 133 species of birds revealed
   results largely consistent with these predictions. Because risk taking
   correlates with other kinds of behavior that constitute a syndrome
   behavioral syndromes can play an important role in producing ecological
   syndromes (i.e., correlations between ecological traits).}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour has been termed `animal
   personality' and has been identified across a range of behavioural
   contexts including aggression, boldness in response to a threatening
   stimulus and exploration. When behaviours are correlated across multiple
   functional behavioural categories or `contexts', `behavioural syndromes'
   are said to be present. It is possible, however, that behavioural
   syndromes may also show consistencies. Here we investigated the presence
   of behavioural syndromes linking startle responses, exploration and
   aggression in hermit crabs and assessed their stability across two
   situations (low versus high predation risk). Correlation analyses
   detected behavioural syndromes between startle responses, a measure of
   `boldness', and the latency to investigate a novel object, as well as
   the latency to attack an opponent in an aggressive context. The startle
   response-investigation and startle response-aggression syndromes were
   stable between situations, whilst there was a lack of relationship
   between investigation and aggression in each situation. Here we propose
   that these consistent individual differences in the expression of
   behavioural syndromes reveal the presence of animal personality,
   manifesting in not just one, but a suite of interacting traits.}},

Abstract = {{The fitness consequences of animal personalities (also known as
   behavioural syndromes) have recently been studied in several solitary
   species. However, the adaptive significance of collective personalities
   in social insects and especially of behavioural variation among group
   members remains largely unexplored. Although intracolonial behavioural
   variation is an important component of division of labour, and as such a
   key feature for the success of societies, empirical links between
   behavioural variation and fitness are scarce. We investigated
   aggression, exploration and brood care behaviour in Temnothorax
   longispinosus ant colonies. We focused on two distinct aspects:
   intercolonial variability and its consistency across time and contexts,
   and intracolonial variability and its influence on productivity.
   Aggressiveness was consistent over four to five months with a new
   generation of workers emerging in between trial series. Other behaviours
   were not consistent over time. Exploration of novel environments
   responded to the sequence of assays: colonies were faster in discovering
   when workers previously encountered opponents in aggression experiments.
   Suites of correlated behaviours (e. g. aggression-exploration syndrome)
   present in the first series did not persist over time. Finally, colonies
   with more intracolonial behavioural variation in brood care and
   exploration of novel objects were more productive under standardized
   conditions than colonies with less variation.}},

Abstract = {{Ratings of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and orang-utan, Pongo pygmaeus
   and Pongo abelii, personality reveal dimensions resembling those found
   in humans. Critics have argued that this similarity derives from
   anthropomorphic projection or other rater-based effects. We developed
   two forms of data reduction analyses to determine whether these
   dimensions can best be explained by the inherent tendencies of the
   animals (e.g. orang-utans that are curious are playful) or
   anthropomorphic projections of raters (e.g. believing that orang-utans
   that are curious should be playful). We found that personality
   dimensions derived after differences between rater means and
   rater{*}item interactions had been removed from ratings replicated the
   previously discovered dimensions. Conversely, we found a different set
   of dimensions when analysing items from which differences between animal
   means and animal{*}item interactions had been removed. Finally, we used
   multilevel factor analysis to examine whether the published structure
   was replicated when we extracted factors based on the within-level
   animal differences in item scores effects while allowing between-rater
   differences to covary freely. Again, the personality dimensions were
   similar to those described in previous studies. These analyses can be
   used in combination with interrater reliability, temporal stability, and
   correlations between personality and other external variables to
   validate animal personality ratings. These analyses confirmed that
   personality similarities between humans and great apes are best
   explained by genetic and phylogenetic affinity and not by
   anthropomorphic artefacts. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Individuals are regularly documented to consistently differ in their
   behavioural types (BTs). For example, some individuals are bold whereas
   others are shy. Within the human personality literature, the big five
   personality dimensions are commonly documented to be sex-specific with
   testosterone suggested to underpin traits such as aggressiveness. In
   non-human animals recent research suggests sex-specific BT expression
   may be influenced by ecology, mating system and sexual selection. While
   most research on sex-specific personality has focused on dioecious
   species, we explore sex differences in BT expression in a sequential
   hermaphrodite the mangrove killifish. We replicate within 7 isogenic
   genotypes and investigate sex differences (hermaphrodite and secondary
   male) in three BTs (exploration, boldness and aggresion). This approach
   allows us to investigate sex differences in BT expression whilst
   controlling for genetic variation. In this study we find that both
   secondary males and hermaphrodites are repeatable at the individual
   level yet there was no difference between the sexes in average BT
   scores. Furthermore. aggression scores differed between genotypes, and
   were repeatable at the genotype level, suggesting strong genetic
   control. Finally, male boldness was significantly more repeatable than
   hermaphrodites potentially supporting recent proposals relating to
   sexual selection. We document a behavioural syndrome in male fish with
   bolder individuals being more aggressive, this behavioural syndrome was
   not observed however in hermaphrodites. In contrast to a previous
   developmental study in this species exploration did not correlate with
   either aggression or boldness in either males or hermaphrodites. (c)

Abstract = {{Contest theory predicts the evolution of a stable mixture of different
   strategies for fighting. Here, we investigate the possibility that
   stable between-individual differences in startle-response durations
   influence fighting ability or `resource-holding potential' (RHP) in the
   beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina. Both winners and losers showed
   significant repeatability of pre-fight startle-response durations but
   mean pre-fight startle-response durations were greater for eventual
   losers than for eventual winners, indicating that RHP varies with
   boldness. In particular, individuals with short startle responses
   inflicted more attacks on their opponent. Both repeatability and
   mean-level responses were changed by the experience of fighting, and
   these changes varied with outcome. In losers, repeatability was
   disrupted to a greater extent and the mean startle-response durations
   were subject to a greater increase than in winners. Thus, following a
   fight, this behavioural correlate of RHP behaves in a way similar to
   post-fight changes in physiological status, which can also vary between
   winners and losers. Understanding the links between aggression and
   boldness therefore has the potential to enhance our understanding of
   both the evolution of animal personality and the `winner and loser
   effects' of post-fight changes in RHP.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that individual personality is tightly linked to
   individual life histories and to environmental variation. The
   reactive-proactive axis, for example, is thought to reflect whether
   individuals prioritize productivity or survival, mutually exclusive
   options that can be caused by conflicts between foraging and
   anti-predation behaviour. Evidence for this trade-off hypothesis,
   however, is limited. Here, we tested experimentally whether exploration
   behaviour (EB), an assay of proactivity, could explain how great tits
   (Parus major) respond to changes in starvation and predation risk.
   Individuals were presented with two feeders, holding good or poor
   quality food, which interchanged between safe and dangerous positions 10
   m apart, across two 24 h treatments. Starvation risk was assumed to be
   highest in the morning and lowest in the afternoon. The proportion of
   time spent feeding on good quality food (PTG) rather than poor quality
   food was repeatable within treatments, but individuals varied in how PTG
   changed with respect to predation-and starvation-risk across treatments.
   This individual plasticity variation in foraging behaviour was linked to
   EB, as predicted by the reactive-proactive axis, but only among
   individuals in dominant social classes. Our results support the
   trade-off hypothesis at the level of individuals in a wild population,
   and suggest that fine-scale temporal and spatial variation may play
   important roles in the evolution of personality.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization creates novel environments for wild animals where selection
   pressures may differ drastically from those in natural habitats.
   Adaptation to urban life involves changes in various traits, including
   behavior. Behavioral traits often vary consistently among individuals,
   and these so-called personality traits can be correlated with each
   other, forming behavioral syndromes. Despite their adaptive significance
   and potential to act as constraints, little is known about the role of
   animal personality and behavioral syndromes in animals' adaptation to
   urban habitats. In this study we tested whether differently urbanized
   habitats select for different personalities and behavioral syndromes by
   altering the population mean, inter-individual variability, and
   correlations of personality traits. We captured house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus) from four different populations along the gradient of
   urbanization and assessed their behavior in standardized test
   situations. We found individual consistency in neophobia, risk taking,
   and activity, constituting three personality axes. On the one hand,
   urbanization did not consistently affect the mean and variance of these
   traits, although there were significant differences between some of the
   populations in food neophobia and risk taking (both in means and
   variances). On the other hand, both urban and rural birds exhibited a
   behavioral syndrome including object neophobia, risk taking and
   activity, whereas food neophobia was part of the syndrome only in rural
   birds. These results indicate that there are population differences in
   certain aspects of personality in house sparrows, some of which may be
   related to habitat urbanization. Our findings suggest that urbanization
   and/or other population-level habitat differences may not only influence
   the expression of personality traits but also alter their
   inter-individual variability and the relationships among them, changing
   the structure of behavioral syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{The arms race between predators and prey has led to morphological and
   behavioral adaptations. Different antipredator strategies can coexist
   within a population if each strategy is the result of a trade-off with
   competing demands. Antipredator behavior can be associated with
   morphological traits, like color patterns, either because in the context
   of sexual selection, coloration signals the ability to avoid predators
   or because coloration is a naturally selected trait useful in avoiding
   predators. Because in the barn owl (Tyto alba), heritable eumelanic
   plumage coloration is associated with the glucocorticoid-dependent
   response to stress, we tested whether antipredator behavior is also
   related to this trait. Compared with small-spotted nestlings,
   individuals displaying larger black spots hissed more intensely in the
   presence of humans, feigned death longer, had a lower breathing rate
   under stress, and were more docile when handled. Cross-fostering
   experiments showed that the covariation between the spot size and the
   duration of feigning death was inherited from the biological mother,
   whereas covariation between spot size and docility was inherited from
   the biological father. Our results confirm that melanin-based coloration
   is associated with suites of behavioral traits, which are under both
   genetic and environmental influence. Coloration can thus evolve as a
   direct or indirect response to predation, but it can also be a signal of
   antipredator strategies to potential mates.}},

Abstract = {{Animals attacked by predators often enter a state of tonic immobility
   (TI) in which individuals appear to simulate death. Despite the fact
   that TI is often used as a proxy of fear in domesticated animals,
   quantitative data on individual variation is very scarce for wild
   vertebrates. As a consequence, we lack ecological interpretations for
   the variability in TI that may exist in wild populations. Here, we
   tested whether there are consistent differences among individuals in 2
   components of TI within wild populations of 2 avian species, the
   Yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer) and the Tree sparrow (Passer
   montanus). We next tested whether this variation reflects variation in
   boldness toward predators (measured as the response to 2 predator
   models) or is simply related to variation in general
   activity/restlessness (measured as baseline activity) in the bishop. We
   analyzed our data by means of Bayesian structural equation modeling
   (SEM), which has several general advantages and, moreover, allowed us to
   analyze censored (truncated) data. We found good support for relatively
   high repeatability within individuals of both components of TI. Measures
   of TI appeared to be uncorrelated with baseline activity. In contrast,
   our results suggest that individual variation in TI in a wild vertebrate
   can be interpreted in a context of boldness toward predators, making TI
   a meaningful and practical behavioral trait for studies involving
   personality and antipredation behavior in wild populations. In addition,
   we show that the Bayesian structural equation modeling approach to
   analyze censored data had greater statistical power than other
   approaches. Hence, this rarely implemented technique deserves to be more
   widely used.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural consistency or predictability through time and/or different
   contexts ('syndromes' or `personality types') is likely to have
   substantial influence on animal life histories and fitness.
   Consequently, there is much interest in the forces driving and
   maintaining various syndromes. Individual host behaviours have been
   associated with susceptibility to parasitism, yet the role of
   pre-existing personality types in acquiring infections has not been
   investigated experimentally. Using a larval amphibian-trematode parasite
   model system, we report that tadpoles generally showed consistency in
   their activity level in response to both novel food and parasite
   exposure. Not only were individual activity level and exploration in the
   novel food context correlated with each other and with anti-parasite
   behaviour, all three were significant predictors of host parasite load.
   This is the first empirical demonstration that host behaviours in other
   contexts are related to behaviours mitigating infection risk and,
   ultimately, host parasite load. We suggest that this system illustrates
   how reliably high levels of activity and exploratory behaviour in
   different contexts might maximize both energy acquisition and resistance
   to trematode parasites. Such benefits could drive selection for the
   behavioural syndrome seen here owing to the life histories and
   ecological circumstances typical of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus)
   larvae.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{A surging interest in the evolution of consistent trait correlations has
   inspired research on pigment patterns as a correlate of behavioural
   syndromes, or ``animal personalities{''}. Associations between
   pigmentation, physiology and health status are less investigated as
   potentially conserved trait clusters. In the current study, lice counts
   performed on farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar naturally infected with
   ectoparasitic sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis showed that individual
   fish with high incidence of black melanin-based skin spots harboured
   fewer female sea lice carrying egg sacs, compared to less pigmented
   fish. There was no significant association between pigmentation and lice
   at other developmental stages, suggesting that host factors associated
   with melanin-based pigmentation may modify ectoparasite development to a
   larger degree than settlement. In a subsequent laboratory experiment a
   strong negative correlation between skin spots and post-stress cortisol
   levels was revealed, with less pigmented individuals showing a more
   pronounced cortisol response to acute stress. The observation that lice
   prevalence was strongly increased on a fraction of sexually mature male
   salmon which occurred among the farmed fish further supports a role for
   steroid hormones as mediators of reduced parasite resistance. The data
   presented here propose steroid hormones as a proximate cause for the
   association between melanin-based pigmentation and parasites. Possible
   fundamental and applied implications are discussed.}},
