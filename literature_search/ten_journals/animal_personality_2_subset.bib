Title = {{Repeated Recent Aggressive Encounters Do Not Affect Behavioral
   Consistency in Male Siamese Fighting Fish}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behavior suggest that individuals
   respond in a predictable and repeatable manner in a specific situation
   while differing from other individuals. Male Siamese fighting fish
   exhibit consistent individual differences in decision-making strategies
   when they encounter a receptive female and a rival male simultaneously.
   However, whether these differences are altered by recent experience is
   unknown. We examined the influence of repeated aggressive encounters on
   behavioral consistency and decision-making. Males were presented with
   paired femalemale dummies prior to any aggressive experiences to obtain
   a baseline measure. Next, males either won or lost three consecutive
   contests against rivals and then received the paired femalemale dummies
   after each of these encounters. Overall levels of highly aggressive
   behaviors were affected by contest outcome, while levels of
   female-directed were not. Not surprisingly, winning a fight led to an
   increase in male-directed bites, an overtly aggressive behavior that
   only occurs after fights have escalated. Fighting a male before
   encountering the dummies caused males to perform more tail beats to the
   dummy male, perhaps as a result of increased motivation. Males exhibited
   similar levels of repeatability and used the same strategies when faced
   with conflicting stimuli regardless of fighting experience. Thus, while
   winning or losing a fight impacts overall aggression, it does not
   influence behavioral consistency. This study demonstrates that
   consistent individual differences and decision-making strategies may be
   resistant to recent aggressive experiences, even over a period of days.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of animal personality are completed in the laboratory with
   animals collected from the wild. However, there is some concern that
   studies that trap individuals to perform assessments of personality may
   not collect a representative sample of personality types, as some
   individuals may be trap-shy. We investigated the relationship between
   boldness and trappability using males of a species of lizard, the
   Namibian rock agama, Agama planiceps, whose boldness could be assessed
   in the wild prior to trapping. We observed known individuals between
   nine and 15 times each over several weeks, which revealed that boldness
   consistently differed across individuals and was not influenced by
   factors such as body size or environmental variables. Lizards habituated
   to the behavioural assay, but there was no evidence of plasticity
   (individual differences) in the rate of habituation. As predicted, bold
   individuals entered the trap sooner than shy individuals and we had
   higher success at trapping bold individuals. Using a simple simulation
   model, we show that such bias leads to underestimates of effect size and
   reduces the power to detect correlations between behavioural traits
   (i.e. behavioural syndromes). We suggest that studies that trap animals
   for laboratory assessments of personality may consistently
   underrepresent the extent of personality trait variation in the
   populations that they sample, and recommend that future studies either
   develop methods for testing personality in the field that control for
   obvious confounding variables or make every effort to ensure minimum
   bias when sampling animals for use in a laboratory setting. (C) 2012 The

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Although the occurrence of individuals' behavioral differences in a
   ``shyness-boldness{''} continuum (i.e., animals' propensity to take
   risks) is well established from experimental studies, little is known
   about how this personality trait might influence individual predation
   risk management decisions in natural systems. We recorded the risk
   management strategies (RMS) of a natural population of redshanks by
   observing the daily behavioral decisions made by foraging individuals.
   These included proximity to neighbors, flock size, position with respect
   to predator concealing cover, and vigilance. Using hierarchical mixed
   effects models, we found that although variation in most of these RMS
   had a significant individual component, only vigilance was moderately
   repeatable and therefore a personality trait. There was no evidence for
   a behavioral risk management syndrome: there were no significant
   correlations of vigilance with aggressiveness or exploratory behavior.
   Vigilance levels were highly flexible, were adjusted to the riskiness of
   the situation, and individuals varied in the degree of this plasticity,
   suggesting that a redshank's boldness (personality) may only contribute
   a small amount to natural risk management and that it is situation
   dependent. This emphasizes that although variable risk and profitability
   in the environment may select for different personalities (e.g., that
   determine baseline levels of vigilance all things being equal), these
   baseline levels can be modified greatly through behavioral flexibility
   when individuals are confronted by a change in environmental context,
   potentially removing these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Animals constantly need to cope with changes in their environment.
   Coping with changes in cues that are associated with the location and
   abundance of food is essential for being able to adjust behaviourally to
   a variable environment. The use of cues in decision making requires
   appropriate levels of attention and learning ability, which may be
   affected by the personality of an individual. The relationship between
   personality, attention and learning as essential mechanisms for
   behavioural adaptation, however, is not well understood. We studied the
   relationship between attention to environmental cues, behavioural
   flexibility in learning and exploratory behaviour, a proxy for
   personality, in great tits, Parus major. We used a dimensional shift
   learning paradigm; a learning task involving several stages differing in
   complexity and requiring attention to changes in relevant cues. The
   results show personality differences in performance in learning
   flexibility in only the apparently most difficult stage, yet in opposite
   directions for males and females. Fast-exploring males showed more
   flexible learning abilities than slow males, whereas in females slow
   explorers outperformed fast explorers. These context-dependent and
   sex-specific personality effects reveal behavioural and cognitive
   mechanisms that may underlie observed sex-and personality-dependent
   fitness differences in natural populations. (C) 2011 The Association for

Abstract = {{It has been established that various species exhibit personality,

   in behavioural phenotypes. For example, certain individuals may
   demonstrate consistently greater behavioural reactions and elevated

   analyses on male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in captivity to
   investigate the patterns and proximate mediators of individual
   variations in behavioural reactions. We found intra-individual
   consistency and inter-individual variation in behavioural reactions
   (intensive vigilance towards the direction of speakers) to vocalisations
   by unfamiliar chimpanzees. This behavioural reaction was positively
   correlated with changes in salivary cortisol concentration, suggesting
   that stress is a proximate factor mediating the variation in behavioural
   reactions. The males who were highly responsive to the conspecific
   vocalisation also exhibited high behavioural reactions towards the
   neutral broadcast stimulus (the jungle crows Corvus macrorhynchos ka
   vocalisation). This observation is consistent with the notion that male
   chimpanzees vary in intrinsic behavioural tendency to different stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in boldness have been identified in
   many species and can have important effects on fitness. In most animals,
   juveniles face different costs and benefits of risk-taking behavior than
   do adults. Furthermore, profound changes in hormones, morphology and
   environment often occur when juveniles become adults. Therefore, the
   boldness of individuals might change with ontogeny. In field crickets,
   adult males call to attract sexually receptive females, and male calling
   increases predation risk. We measured the repeatability of boldness
   (latency to emerge from a safe refuge) in both male and female crickets.
   Each cricket was tested once as a small nymph and once as an adult. We
   found that boldness was repeatable across metamorphosis in females, but
   not in males. Males became less bold with maturation, a result that we
   predicted because of the risk associated with calling for mates. We also
   found that in general, nymphs were bolder than adults and that
   individuals spent more time immobile in response to a predator cue when
   they were nymphs, versus when they were adults.}},

   examined the influence of neonatal immune status on the development of
   adult personality. We examined how non-pathogenic immune challenges,
   administered at different stages of development, affected two common
   measures of personality, activity and exploratory behaviour, as well as
   colour-dependent novel object exploration in adult male mallard ducks
   (Anas platyrhynchos). We found that individuals that were
   immune-challenged during the middle (immediately following the
   completion of somatic growth) and late (during the acquisition of
   nuptial plumage) stages of development were more active in novel
   environments as adults relative to developmentally unchallenged birds or
   those challenged at an earlier developmental time point. Additionally,
   individuals challenged during the middle stage of development preferred
   orange and avoided red objects more than those that were not
   immune-challenged during development. Our results demonstrate that, in
   accordance with our predictions, early-life immune system perturbations
   alter the expression of personality traits later in life, emphasizing
   the role that developmental plasticity plays in shaping adult
   personality, and lending support to recent theoretical models that
   suggest that parasite pressure may play an important role in animal
   personality development.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species exhibit behavioural syndromes, groups of two or more
   behaviours that are linked together across different environments or
   time points. Behavioural syndromes give rise to stable behavioural
   profiles and have been likened to personality in humans. However, the
   proximate causes (or mechanisms) that underlie the clustering of
   behaviour are not well understood. In this review, we examine the
   proximate causes of the aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, which
   constitutes a positive correlation between aggression, boldness and
   exploratory activity. In particular, we will focus on novel insights
   that have been gained from zebrafish, a genetically tractable
   behavioural model which can be used to study the mechanistic basis of
   behaviour. Studies of the proximate causes of behavioural syndromes
   provide us with the opportunity to understand the clustering of
   behaviours - and perhaps even the basis of personality - at the
   molecular level. Thus, this exciting field not only promises to bring
   novel insights into animal behaviour, but also forces us to rethink our
   own personalities as well.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their key role as model organisms in many behavioral studies,
   crustacean decapods have been only slightly touched upon by the recent
   surge of scientific interest in animal personality. Only seven articles
   investigated the issue in a handful of species among hermit crabs,
   crabs, and crayfish. Obviously, a limited number of publications does
   not mean that personality is rare in decapods. On the contrary, few
   studies might be the result of a form of reluctance by behavioral
   ecologists to deal with such a phenomenon in these and other
   invertebrates. This reluctance contrasts with the enthusiasm shown in
   tackling the behavioral plasticity issue. Here we discuss the possible
   theoretical and methodological difficulties raised by applying the
   animal personality perspective to decapods and analyze implications of
   personality studies for their ecology, conservation, and welfare. By
   highlighting gaps in knowledge and directions of future research, our
   intention is to increase scientific emphasis on the issue {[}Current

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{580-588}},
Abstract = {{Social insect colonies and the workers comprising them, each exhibit
   consistent individual differences in behavior, also known as
   `personalities'. Because the behavior of social insect colonies emerges
   from the actions of their workers, individual variation among workers'
   personality may be important in determining the variation we observe
   among colonies. The reproductive unit of social insects, on which
   natural selection acts, is the colony, not individual workers.
   Therefore, it is important to understand what mechanisms govern the
   observed variation among colonies. Here I propose three hypotheses that
   address how consistent individual differences in the behavior of workers
   may lead to consistent individual differences in the behavior of
   colonies: 1. Colonies differ consistently in their average of worker
   personality; 2. The distribution but not the average of worker
   personalities varies consistently among colonies; and 3. Colony
   personality does not emerge from its worker personality composition but
   from consistent external constraints. I review evidence supporting each
   of these hypotheses and suggest methods to further investigate them. The
   study of how colony personality emerges from the personalities of the
   workers comprising them may shed light on the mechanisms underlying
   consistent individual differences in the behavior of other animals

   three general themes within the behavioral syndromes literature for
   which spiders have served as front running model systems: (1) how trait
   correlations beget performance trade-offs, (2) the influence that
   behavioral trait variants have on interspecific interactions and (3)
   mechanisms that aid in maintaining behavioral variation within- and

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{601-622}},
Abstract = {{It is becoming clear that individual animals exhibit behaviours that are
   repeatable, consistent and predictable across various contexts and time,
   and that may be correlated to form behavioural syndromes. The influence
   of parasitism on host behaviour, although well-documented, is only now
   being examined in a multi-trait context, and behavioural syndromes
   provide a framework for such investigations. We test the hypothesis that
   parasites modify host behavioural syndromes by quantifying the
   relationship between infection by four trematode species and the
   correlations, repeatability and consistency of three host behaviours
   (activity, aggression and boldness) in a freshwater fish, Gobiomorphus
   cotidianus, in the presence and absence of a predator odour. There was a
   significant correlation between activity and aggression, and both these
   behaviour showed higher values in the presence of a chemical predator
   cue. Of the behaviours tested, only aggression responses were
   significantly related to infection with one of the parasites, Apatemon
   sp. Activity, aggression and boldness scores were repeatable across test
   sessions, but much less so in the presence of a predator cue.
   Interestingly, individual-level consistency in activity and aggression
   was significantly associated with infection by Telogaster opisthorchis,
   Deretrema philippae and/or Apatemon sp., with the direction of the
   association depending on the behaviour tested. These findings suggest
   that behavioural syndromes may not only be targets for adaptive host
   manipulation by parasites, but also that, even if through mere
   pathology, parasites could act as external agents generating variation
   in behavioural syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behavioural traits may play a role in
   reproductive behaviour and it is likely that different personality types
   have different reproductive success across specific social environments.
   This suggests a role for sexual selection for personality types,
   including a link between behavioural traits and alternative reproductive
   tactics. While research on morphological differences between guarders
   (bourgeois males defending resources) and sneakers (males parasitizing
   the territories of bourgeois males) is well characterized, the role of
   personality in the adoption of alternative mating tactics has hitherto
   been largely ignored. We investigated individual behavioural differences
   in a sneaker-guarder mating system using size/age-matched males of a
   small freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). We
   predicted distinct behavioural responses by guarder and sneaker males
   that were consistent in different contexts, indicating the existence of
   behavioural syndromes associated with male mating tactic. No behavioural
   syndromes were detected in male R. amarus, despite ability of individual
   male bitterling to establish dominance, boldness and investment in sperm
   competition being relatively repeatable across three consecutive trials.
   Male aggression, though not repeatable, was negatively correlated with
   the number of ejaculations, indicating a trade-off between aggression
   and sperm loading. No association between the tendency of males to guard
   a territory and behavioural traits was found, despite a significant
   association between the tendency to guard and morphological and
   physiological traits, with higher relative testis size and more breeding
   tubercles in guarder males. Our data suggest male bitterling mating
   tactics are largely unconstrained by innate factors and likely to be the
   product of prevailing environmental and social conditions.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{149}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-231}},
Abstract = {{Individual differences in exploratory behaviour have been shown to be
   consistent across contexts and suggested to be part of behavioural
   syndromes in a diversity of species, including fish. Exploration has
   also been shown to be a key factor in understanding complex ecological
   processes such as sexual selection and cooperation. Another important
   question in ecology is why animals breed in colonies. Exploration
   syndromes, by affecting prospecting behaviour, dispersal and public
   information use may also contribute to our understanding of coloniality.
   This study aims at investigating whether an exploration syndrome exists
   in a colonial fish species, Neolamprologus caudopunctatus. Individuals
   of this species were subjected to two consecutive tests, a novel
   environment and a novel object test. Results show that more explorative
   individuals in a novel environment are also less neophobic in the
   presence of a novel object, suggesting that the tendency to engage with
   novelty per se is a consistent trait and part of an exploration
   syndrome. These results are discussed in light of the contribution of an
   exploration syndrome to explain colony formation in animals.}},

Abstract = {{The animal personality literature uses three approaches to assess
   personality. However, two of these methods, personality ratings and
   experimentation, have been little compared in captivity and never
   compared in the wild. We assessed the boldness of wild chacma baboons
   Papio ursinus using both ratings and experimental methods. Boldness was
   experimentally assessed when individuals were presented with a novel
   food item during natural foraging. The boldness of the same individuals
   was rated on a five-point scale by experienced observers. The ratings
   and experimental assessments of boldness were found to correlate
   positively and in a linear fashion. When considered categorically the
   two approaches showed variable agreement depending on the number of
   categories assigned and the cutoff criteria adopted. We suggest that the
   variation between approaches arises because each method captures
   different aspects of personality; ratings consider personality in
   absolute terms (using predefined criteria) and multiple contexts, while
   experimental assessments consider personality in relative terms (using
   experimental scores relative to the population average) and in limited
   contexts. We encourage animal personality researchers to consider
   adopting both methodologies in future studies. We also propose that
   future studies restrict their analyses to continuous data, since the
   greatest comparability between methods was found with these data.
   However, if individuals must be categorised, we suggest that researchers
   either (a) analyse only those individuals categorised as bold or shy by
   both ratings and experimental approaches or, if these methods cannot be
   employed simultaneously, (b) do not use approach-specific criteria but
   choose a cut-off that can be compared by both approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Both personality and plasticity can influence fitness, but few studies
   have investigated these two sources of individual variation
   simultaneously for the same behaviour. The individual quality hypothesis
   proposes that individuals with high personality scores will also be
   better able to respond to the changes in the environment (i.e. have a
   high degree of plasticity). Alternatively, the `compensatory' hypothesis
   proposes that personality and plasticity are negatively correlated,
   because only individuals with low personality scores need to be able to
   rapidly adjust to environmental conditions. To examine these two
   hypotheses, we investigated the overall level of aggressiveness
   (personality) in nest defence, the ability of individuals to adjust this
   behaviour to respond to changes in temperature (plasticity), and their
   consequences for reproductive success in male and female tree swallows,
   Tachycineta bicolor. Using linear mixed effect models with individual as
   a random effect, we found that consistent differences between
   individuals explained approximately 55\% of variation in aggressiveness
   and that more aggressive individuals were better able to adjust to
   variation in temperature, providing support for the individual quality
   hypothesis. However, although more aggressive males tended to fledge a
   higher number of young, the degree of plasticity only conferred a
   reproductive advantage for nonaggressive males, providing support for
   the compensatory hypothesis. For females, neither personality, nor
   plasticity was a good predictor of reproductive success. Our results
   suggest that personality and plasticity in aggressiveness are important
   components of individual variation but that the fitness advantages of
   each are context dependent. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Individual behavioural differences, consistent over time and/or across
   situations, have been included under the term of personality. These
   behavioural differences have been shown to affect a variety of major
   ecological traits, all of which have a strong effect on the fitness of
   the individual. However, the personality of an individual could also
   have a strong influence on the decisions of other individuals, in
   situations such as selecting or avoiding a social companion or a mate.
   Under this scenario, indicators of different personalities would have
   evolved, but the possible signalling of personality has received little
   consideration to date. We hypothesized that birds can signal their
   personality through feather coloration and tested this hypothesis in
   siskins relating different colour patches to their exploration score. To
   measure exploration, we presented the siskins with a novel object and
   calculated how long they took to approach it. We found that siskins with
   larger black bibs showed shorter approach latencies. This finding
   supports the idea that plumage coloration traits can provide information
   about personality traits of the bearer. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies report the presence of consistent
   individual differences in behavior and/or physiology over time and
   context, known as animal personality. A pivotal question in animal
   personality research concerns the mechanism(s) responsible for its
   evolution and maintenance. Negative frequency-dependent selection is
   considered to be one of these important mechanisms, although evidence
   for this is largely absent. Here, we studied whether the feeding
   performance of barnacle geese was negative frequency-dependent in a
   producer-scrounger game. We studied the feeding time of one bold or one
   shy individual in groups consisting of only bold or shy companions to
   study if the rare type in the group performs best. A previous study with
   this species showed that scrounging increased with shyness. Hence, we
   expected shy individuals to do better in the presence of bold companions
   due to the increased scrounging opportunity and bold individuals to do
   better in the presence of shy companions as there were ample
   opportunities to produce food. We found no evidence for negative
   frequency-dependent feeding success; rather, we found that, independent
   of their boldness score, all individuals enjoyed higher feeding success
   when foraging with bold than with shy companions. The higher foraging
   success of individuals foraging with bold companions is explained by a
   higher joining proportion in the presence of bold companions. Our
   results provide no evidence for negative frequency-dependent feeding
   success in barnacle geese but indicate that both bold and shy
   individuals can increase their foraging returns by associating with bold
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{One of the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models
   is that the errors have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedastic). When
   this assumption is violated, standard errors from a regression can be
   biased and inconsistent, meaning that the associated p values and 95\%
   confidence intervals cannot be trusted. The assumption of
   homoscedasticity is made for statistical reasons rather than biological
   reasons; in most real datasets, some form of heteroscedasticity is
   likely to exist. However, a survey of the behavioural ecology literature
   showed that only about 5\% of articles explicitly mentioned
   heteroscedasticity, leaving 95\% of articles in which heteroscedasticity
   was apparently absent. These results strongly indicate that the
   prevalence of heteroscedasticity is widely under-reported within
   behavioural ecology. The aim of this article is to raise awareness of
   heteroscedasticity amongst behavioural ecologists. Using topical
   examples from fields in behavioural ecology such as sexual dimorphism
   and animal personality, we highlight the biological importance of
   considering heteroscedasticity. We also emphasize that researchers
   should pay closer attention to the variance in their data and consider
   what factors could cause heteroscedasticity. In addition, we introduce
   some simple methods of dealing with heteroscedasticity. The two methods
   we focus on are: (1) incorporating variance functions within a
   generalised least squares (GLS) framework to model the functional form
   of heteroscedasticity and; (2) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard
   error (HCSE) estimators, which can be used when the functional form of
   heteroscedasticity is unknown. Using case studies, we show how both
   methods can influence the output from linear regression models. Finally,
   we hope that more researchers will consider heteroscedasticity as an
   important source of additional information about the particular
   biological process being studied, rather than an impediment to
   statistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in cognitive appraisal and emotional
   reactivity, including fearfulness, are important personality traits in
   humans, non-human mammals, and birds. Comparative studies on teleost
   fishes support the existence of coping styles and behavioral syndromes
   also in poikilothermic animals. The functionalist approach to emotions
   hold that emotions have evolved to ensure appropriate behavioral
   responses to dangerous or rewarding stimuli. Little information is
   however available on how evolutionary widespread these putative links
   between personality and the expression of emotional or affective states
   such as fear are. Here we disclose that individual variation in coping
   style predicts fear responses in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus,
   using the principle of avoidance learning. Fish previously screened for
   coping style were given the possibility to escape a signalled aversive
   stimulus. Fearful individuals showed a range of typically reactive
   traits such as slow recovery of feed intake in a novel environment,
   neophobia, and high post-stress cortisol levels. Hence, emotional
   reactivity and appraisal would appear to be an essential component of
   animal personality in species distributed throughout the vertebrate
   subphylum.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral syndromes or animal personalities may emerge due to
   covariation with different life-history strategies individual animals
   pursue, like risk-associated feeding rates translating in different
   growth trajectories. However, less clear is how this might affect
   individuals in cooperatively breeding species, where subordinates assist
   dominants in raising offspring, and growth has profound life-history and
   social consequences. Here, we examined the effects of behavioral type on
   growth rates and feeding in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher, comparing growth rates of individuals settled
   inside a group (dominant or subordinate) or unsettled fish (aggregation)
   of different behavioral types (bold-shy continuum) under a feeding
   regime where food could not be monopolized. Controlling for other
   factors, we found no effect of the behavioral type on the growth rates
   of dominants and subordinates in either sex. In contrast, bold female
   aggregation fish were significantly growing faster in length compared
   with shy female aggregation fish, whereas no such effect was detected in
   male aggregation fish. These growth rate differences were largely
   matched by differences in feeding rates, but locomotion appeared more
   important in determining growth than feeding rate. Our results show that
   differences in social status may need to be taken into account when
   testing for correlations between behavioral type and growth in
   vertebrates, and cautions that growth adjustments may get obscured due
   to correlated changes in other costly behaviors, like locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{Animals of many species show consistency in behaviour across time and
   contexts that differs from other individuals' behaviour in the same
   population. Such `personality' affects fitness and has therefore become
   an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent
   variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living
   species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social
   interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This
   study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive
   chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen
   behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0.21-0.93) in
   at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable
   long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the
   short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed
   with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of
   which consisted of social traits and were labelled `sociability',
   `positive affect' and `equitability'. The two non-social behaviour
   factors were labelled `anxiety' and `activity'. The factor scores were
   analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor
   scores in all traits except `sociability'. The factor scores differed
   also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait
   expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a
   broad range of social and non-social behaviours. The study highlights
   the importance of assessing personality in the social behaviour,
   especially in cohesive social species, as only then can we understand
   the consequences of personality in socially living species.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{In biparental systems, members of the same pair can vary substantially
   in the amount of parental care they provide to offspring. The extent of
   this asymmetry should depend on the relative costs and benefits of care.
   Individual variation in personality is likely to influence this
   trade-off, and hence is a promising candidate to explain differences in
   care. In addition, plasticity in parental care may also be associated
   with personality differences. Using exploration behaviour (EB) as a
   measure of personality, we investigated these possibilities using both
   natural and experimental data from a wild population of great tits
   (Parus major). Contrary to predictions, we found no association between
   EB and natural variation in provisioning behaviour. Nor was EB linked to
   responsiveness to experimentally increased brood demand. These results
   are initially surprising given substantial data from other studies
   suggesting personality should influence investment in parental care.
   However, they are consistent with a recent study showing selection on EB
   is weak and highly context-specific in the focal population. This
   emphasises the difficulty faced by personality studies attempting to
   make predictions based on previous work, given that personalities often
   vary among populations of the same species.}},

Abstract = {{Animals show consistent individual variation in behaviour over time and
   across different situations, a phenomenon commonly termed personality.
   Personality studies are important because, if personality traits extend
   their influence across a wide range of situations, they may help to
   explain the paradoxical occurrence of nonoptimal behaviours. A
   paradigmatic example of nonoptimal behaviour is the striking lack of
   behavioural defences of some hosts of obligate avian brood parasites
   despite the evident costs they incur. Here we propose that the interplay
   between personality features expressed by hosts outside the nest and the
   specialized behaviours expressed by hosts in/or near the nests to deter
   avian brood parasites (i.e. nest defence, egg and nestling recognition
   and ejection) may affect the average level of host behavioural defences
   exhibited at the population level as well as the evolutionary dynamics
   of brood parasiteehost interactions. Differences in personality between
   hosts may relate to the observed variation in susceptibility to brood
   parasitism in a given population, as well as to the set of host
   defensive behaviours expressed in/or near the nests to prevent the costs
   of brood parasites. In addition, differences in parasite density might
   have different consequences for the fitness of different personality
   traits and might potentially explain intermediate tolerance to
   parasitism and even acceptance of parasitic eggs by hosts in populations
   exposed to low selection pressures by brood parasites. Future research
   should thus aim to identify how the different personality traits may
   relate to specialized host defences to explain the occurrence of
   apparent maladaptive host behaviours. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Consistent differences in behaviour, termed behavioural types (BTs) are
   well documented in the animal kingdom. Relatively little is known,
   however, about how and why consistency is maintained within populations.
   In recent years, theoretical work suggests that life history trade-offs
   may be an important mechanism driving the maintenance of interindividual
   variation in BTs. We used a laboratory population of a clonal
   vertebrate, the mangrove killifish, as a model organism. This fish is an
   internally self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodite that exhibits
   within-genotype homozygosity. We utilized 20 genotypes to examine BT
   plasticity (boldness and exploration), the development of behavioural
   correlations, and relationships between life history strategy and BTs at
   five age points during ontogeny. We found that BT scores increased
   during early ontogeny and reached an asymptote near sexual maturity. We
   also found considerable variation in BT developmental plasticity at the
   genotype level. Moreover, although genotypes exhibited high levels of
   plasticity in BTs, strong, significant positive correlations between
   exploration and boldness emerged from day 61 onwards. Furthermore, we
   observed no difference between genotypes in growth rate and growth was
   unrelated to BTs. Contrary to our predictions, we found that while
   genotypes differed in their age at first reproduction and reproductive
   output, these differences were unrelated to BT expression prior to and
   following sexual maturity. We discuss these results in relation to
   mechanisms proposed to drive interindividual variation in BTs and we
   highlight the potential of the mangrove killifish as a model organism
   for animal personality studies. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {{The measurement of female mating preferences is central to the study of
   the evolution of male ornaments. Although several different methods have
   been developed to assess sexual preference in some standardized way, the
   most commonly used procedure consists of recording female spatial
   association with different males presented simultaneously. Sexual
   preference is then inferred from time spent in front of each male.
   However, the extent to which the measurement of female mate-choice is
   related to exploration tendencies has not been addressed so far. In the
   present study we assessed the influence of variation in exploration
   tendencies, a trait closely associated to global personality, on the
   measurement of female mating preference in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia
   guttata) using the widely used four-chamber choice-apparatus. The number
   of movements performed within both exploration and mate-choice apparatus
   was consistent within and across the two contexts. In addition,
   personality explained variation in selectivity, preference strength and
   consistency. High-exploratory females showed lower selectivity, lower
   preference scores and displayed more consistent preference scores. Our
   results suggest that variation in personality may affect the measurement
   of female mating preference and may contribute to explain existing
   inconsistencies across studies.}},

   conducted 2 standardized behavioral tests shortly before the animals
   matured. In small enclosures, we experimentally tested their behavioral
   responses 1) in this novel environment and 2) to the confrontation with
   predator odor. Animals, which were more exploratory during the novel
   environment test, showed lower behavioral signs of anxiety during the
   predator test. Both responses were correlated with individual pup body
   mass, with subjects with higher body mass being more exploratory in the
   first test and showing lower levels of anxiety in the second. The
   animals' current body mass or age when being tested were not correlated
   with any of their responses. First, the correlated responses of the
   animals during the different contexts of the applied tests strongly
   suggest the existence of behavioral phenotypes in European rabbits.
   Second, and most importantly, our study provides evidence that an
   animal's early development can exert long-term effects on its
   personality type, although it is not clear whether body mass per se or
   some correlated physiological features drive the observed relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The main aims of this study were to investigate (1) the occurrence and
   strength of the shyness-boldness behavioural syndrome in brown trout
   fry, (2) whether this syndrome is associated with paternal migratory
   life history, (3) whether fry survival and growth in the wild is
   associated with paternal life history and/or boldness and (4) whether
   offspring performance showed maternal effects. Nine female migratory
   trout were each crossed with one migratory and one resident male and the
   offspring were raised in hatchery tanks until first feeding. The
   behavioural studies showed that fry that responded bold towards a novel
   object also accepted a novel food item earlier and responded more
   aggressively towards their own mirror image. Principal component
   analysis showed that this shyness-boldness syndrome (PC1) explained 34\%
   of the behavioural variation. Offspring boldness was not affected by
   paternal migratory life history, but significant effects of the female
   parent suggested maternal and/or genetic effects. Deviations from this
   pattern (PC2), where some individuals behaved less aggressively and
   performed more approaches to food, explained an additional 17\% of the
   variation in behaviour, and was significantly influenced by length and
   paternal migratory life history. Fry growth and survival in nature was
   not associated with boldness (PC1) or PC2, suggesting that alternative
   behavioural strategies can be successful in nature. However, female
   parent effects on variation in fry size persisted over the first growth
   period in the wild, suggesting that these effects may influence
   offspring fitness during early life when major selection occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The Norway rat is an indispensable model organism. Behavioral studies on
   rats usually concentrate on a single trait without considering how
   different behaviors are linked to each other and whether there are
   differences in this respect between rat strains or sexes. This study
   aims to describe the personality structure of the Norway rat, and
   investigate if the structure of personality varies between sexes or
   populations, using owner assessments of pet rats. Rat owners from three
   countries filled out a questionnaire which was analyzed using structural
   equation modeling. The data were divided between the sexes and
   populations, resulting in six groups. Preliminary exploratory factor
   analysis was first conducted on the most numerous group to form a
   hypothesis about the personality structure, after which confirmatory
   factor analysis was used to discover differences between groups. A three
   factor model consisting of the components activity, tameness and
   anxiousness fit all groups. Both quantitative and qualitative
   differences were found between sexes, especially with respect to the
   trait activity. If neglected, the sex differences compromise the
   generality and reliability of behavioral research on rats. Population
   differences were negligible. The results underline the importance of
   considering the sex of the animal as well as its individual
   characteristics when assessing its wellbeing, behavioral requirements or
   suitability for a certain task or research experiment. Using a method
   adopted from human personality research produced meaningful results
   consistent with previous reports on rodent personality. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{`Animal personality' means that individuals differ from one another in
   either single behaviours or suites of related behaviours in a way that
   is consistent over time. It is usually assumed that such consistent
   individual differences in behaviour are driven by variation in how
   individuals respond to information about their environment, rather than
   by differences in external factors such as variation in microhabitat.
   Since behavioural variation is ubiquitous in nature we might expect
   `animal personality' to be present in diverse taxa, including animals
   with relatively simple nervous systems. We investigated in situ startle
   responses in a sea anemone, Actinia equina, to determine whether
   personalities might be present in this example of an animal with a
   simple nervous system. We found very high levels of repeatability among
   individuals that were re-identified in the same locations over a three
   week sampling period. In a subset of the data, where we used tide-pool
   temperature measurements to control for a key element of variation in
   microhabitat, these high levels of repeatability remained. Although a
   range of other consistent differences in micro-habitat features could
   have contributed to consistent differences between the behaviour of
   individuals, these data suggest the presence of animal personality in A.
   equina. Rather than being restricted to certain groups, personality may
   be a general feature of animals and may be particularly pronounced in
   species with simple nervous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions during development can have long-lasting
   effects on morphology, physiology and behaviour. In contrast to human
   personality, our understanding of how the early environment influences
   the development of animal personality is limited. In bluefin killifish,
   Lucania goodei, a male's mating behaviour is highly repeatable through
   time and across interactions. To examine whether these stable
   behavioural types are influenced by early nutritional and social
   conditions, we reared individuals on either high-or low-food levels in
   combination with either one adult male, one adult female or no adult.
   Individuals reared on high food were larger at the earliest measurements
   and remained so as adults. The high-food treatment also had the highest
   mortality, particularly if individuals were reared with an adult male.
   Despite these growth and survival consequences, the food and social
   treatments did not affect whether males were preferred by females or
   became dominant as adults. While the outcome of social interactions was
   not influenced by the early food and social environment, particular
   mating behaviours were; males reared on low food were more aggressive to
   females and showed more courtship, and males reared without an adult
   were more aggressive to females than those reared with either an adult
   female or male. Our results suggest that some of the behaviours that
   contribute to a male's behavioural type within the mating context and
   that influence mating success in this species are sensitive to aspects
   of the early environment. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Understanding/predicting ecological invasions is an important challenge
   in modern ecology because of their immense economical and ecological
   costs. Recent studies have revealed that within-species variation in
   behaviour (i.e. animal personality) can shed light on the invasion
   process. The general hypothesis is that individuals' personality type
   may affect their colonization success, suggesting that some individuals
   might be better invaders than others. We have recently shown that, in
   the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), social personality trait
   was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial
   individuals dispersing further. Here, we tested how mean personality
   within a population, in addition to individual personality type, affect
   dispersal and settlement decisions in the mosquitofish. We found that
   individual dispersal tendencies were influenced by the population's mean
   boldness and sociability score. For example, individuals from
   populations with more asocial individuals or with more bold individuals
   are more likely to disperse regardless of their own personality type. We
   suggest that identifying behavioural traits facilitating invasions, even
   at the group level, can thus have direct applications in pest
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals store food in small, widely dispersed scatter hoards or in
   large larder hoards in burrows or other centralized locations. Kangaroo
   rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in
   food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used
   laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding
   by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys
   merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in
   arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and
   individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their
   behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some
   subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both
   species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding
   propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between
   males as well as greater variation between trials for individual
   females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace
   lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's
   kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding
   behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating
   strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache
   pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with
   differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This
   study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural
   plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and
   females. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Personality traits are becoming increasingly important in explaining
   adaptive individual differences in animal behaviour and probably
   represent a leading edge of the evolutionary process. Despite the
   new-found interest in animal personality among behavioural ecologists,
   few studies have investigated the link between personality traits and
   fitness measures. We examined this link using male rainbowfish,
   Melanotaenia duboulayi, as a model species and found that a range of
   personality traits (aggression, activity and boldness) covaried with a
   male's position in a hierarchy, which is directly related to
   reproductive success in this and many other species. Dominant fish were
   more aggressive, active, bold and also significantly larger than
   subordinate fish. Moreover, we found strong correlations between
   activity levels and boldness suggesting that selection may act on a
   suite of traits in concert (sensu behavioural syndromes). When taken
   together with previous research, our results suggest that the
   activity-boldness syndrome is likely to be domain specific. We suggest
   that multiple trait correlations may be generated by high levels of
   competition (e. g. sexual selection) in addition to predation pressure
   as identified by previous studies. (C) 2011 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional
   stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory
   growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the
   level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet,
   compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in
   life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we
   tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory
   behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their
   exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2
   consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated
   with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural
   consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect
   exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory
   growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies
   from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on
   whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in
   elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with
   potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative
   strategies in different environmental conditions. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Despite an expanding interest in animal personalities, the influence of
   social interactions and sex differences on individual differences in
   behaviour remains poorly understood. Using the social zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata), we tested for behavioural differences in
   exploration of a novel environment and objects, between individuals of
   both sexes in relation to a social context; the presence of three male
   companions, three female companions or no companion birds. We predicted
   that the presence of conspecific companions should result in focal birds
   reacting to novelty by exploring more extensively because the companion
   birds contribute to anti-predator vigilance behaviour and because social
   isolation often causes behavioural inhibition in social species. We
   found that exploratory behaviour of focal individuals was significantly
   reduced in the presence of conspecific companions, irrespective of the
   companion's sex. Moreover, we found a weak trend towards females being
   more exploratory than males, irrespective of the social context. These
   results demonstrate the importance of considering the social context in
   animal personality studies and of exploring sex differences in
   personalities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals within species differ in their behavioural reactions to the
   environment. Consistent individual differences in these behaviours
   (personality traits) are often correlated and known to be under natural
   selection. These differences are frequently associated with variation in
   physiological traits, such as endocrine profiles. For example, variation
   in circulating testosterone levels is associated with variation in
   several personality traits and has been hypothesized to be a marker for
   personality in humans and rodents. The importance of testosterone in
   controlling both behavioural strategies and individual physiological
   differences suggests that direct selection on personality traits might
   cause pleiotropic selection on the physiological mechanisms underlying
   these traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified levels of plasma
   testosterone levels and measured phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced
   immune responses of male great tits, Parus major, in lines artificially
   selected for diverging levels of avian personality ('fast' and `slow'
   exploratory behaviour). We found that testosterone levels were highly
   repeatable within individuals and fluctuated predictably over the
   season. Contrary to our expectations, `slow' explorers had consistently
   higher levels of baseline testosterone and higher immune responses than
   `fast' explorers. These results show that phenotypic selection for
   variation in personality traits corresponds to consistent differences in
   hormone profile and immune function, but that higher aggression levels
   do not need to be associated with higher baseline testosterone levels.
   Our results confirm that personality traits have evolved as a result of
   selection on both the underlying controlling physiological mechanisms
   and the phenotypic traits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{How task specialization, individual task performance and within-group
   behavioural variation affects fitness is a longstanding and unresolved
   problem in our understanding of animal societies. In the temperate
   social spider, Anelosimus studiosus, colony members exhibit a
   behavioural polymorphism; females either exhibit an aggressive `asocial'
   or docile `social' phenotype. We assessed individual prey-capture
   success for both phenotypes, and the role of phenotypic composition on
   group-level prey-capture success for three prey size classes. We then
   estimated the effect of group phenotypic composition on fitness in a
   common garden, as inferred from individual egg-case masses. On average,
   asocial females were more successful than social females at capturing
   large prey, and colony-level prey-capture success was positively
   associated with the frequency of the asocial phenotype. Asocial colony
   members were also more likely to engage in prey-capture behaviour in
   group-foraging situations. Interestingly, our fitness estimates indicate
   females of both phenotypes experience increased fitness when occupying
   colonies containing unlike individuals. These results imply a reciprocal
   fitness benefit of within-colony behavioural variation, and perhaps
   division of labour in a spider society.}},

Abstract = {{When engaged in behavioural games, animals can adjust their use of
   alternative tactics until groups reach stable equilibria. Recent theory
   on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should
   differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree
   of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be
   consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts.
   These predictions have yet to be tested empirically and so we examine
   the behavioural adjustment of individual nutmeg mannikins (Lonchura
   punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two
   different social foraging games: producer-scrounger (PS) and
   patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual
   differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two
   games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent
   over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month
   period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling
   behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The
   rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively
   associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC
   trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of
   pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an
   important component of this plasticity is group-and/or context-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Despite rapidly accumulating evidence for the existence of consistent
   individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours (i.e. `animal
   personalities'), little is known about proximate mechanisms causing such
   variation. Individual variation in circulating levels of testosterone
   (T) is often hypothesized to underpin personality traits such as
   aggressiveness and exploratory behaviour. Here we provide a
   comprehensive test of this hypothesis. We quantified variation in
   exploratory behaviour of a novel environment in a captive population of
   wild-caught male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We then investigated
   the relationship between the observed behaviours and circulating levels
   of T, using two approaches. First, we tested whether measures of
   exploratory behaviour correlated with (1) point-sampled plasma T levels
   and (2) T-dependent ornamentation (bill coloration) in 114 males.
   Neither direct nor indirect estimates of individual variation in T
   levels were correlated with the assayed behaviours. Second, we
   experimentally increased plasma T levels of 21 males with T implants,
   using 21 placebo-implanted males as a control group. Experimentally
   induced between-individual variation in T levels did not increase the
   amount of between-individual variation in exploratory behaviour. Our
   results thus strongly suggest that, in house sparrows,
   between-individual variation in circulating levels of T cannot serve as
   a causal explanation for the existence of individual variation in
   exploratory behaviour. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Although in recent years behavioral syndromes have received a wealth of
   attention, how traits within syndromes respond to changing environments
   is not well resolved. Here, we test the effects of temperature on a
   suite of behavioral traits in the spider Anelosimus studiosus to
   determine (1) whether there are shifts in individuals' social tendency,
   activity level, and foraging behavior in response to temperature, (2) if
   these traits shift are in the direction predicted by within-population
   axes of trait covariance, and (3) whether the effects of temperature
   differ among individuals. In previous work, we documented a behavioral
   syndrome in A. studiosus where increased tolerance of conspecifics is
   correlated with decreased activity level and aggressiveness toward prey.
   Furthermore, there are distinct among-population differences in
   behavior, where individuals from warm sites tend to be more aggressive
   and active than individuals from cold sites. Our data here reveal that
   at warmer temperatures A. studiosus exhibit diminished tolerance of
   conspecifics, increased activity levels, shorter latencies of attack,
   and increased tendencies to attack multiple prey items. Furthermore, we
   found that individual differences in behavior were consistent across
   temperature regimes for the majority of behavioral traits considered
   here: social tendency, activity level, and latency of attack. These
   findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these behaviors are
   linked together by shared genetic underpinnings (e.g., metabolic
   differences) and shift non-independently in response to contemporary
   abiotic environment (i.e., temperature). Furthermore, our data suggest
   that temperature itself could be responsible for the among-population
   variation in social structure in A. studiosus.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality, defined as consistent individual differences across
   context and time, has attracted much recent research interest in the
   study of animal behaviour. More recently, this field has begun to
   examine how such variation arose and is maintained within populations.
   The habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, which posits that animals
   with differing personality types may fare better (i.e. have a fitness
   advantage) in different habitats, suggests one possible mechanism. In
   the current experiment, we tested whether slow-and fast-exploring
   black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), determined by
   performance in a novel environment exploration task, perform
   differentially when the demands of an acoustic operant discrimination
   (cognitive) task were altered following successful task acquisition. We
   found that slow-exploring birds learn to reverse previously learned
   natural category rules more quickly than faster exploring conspecifics.
   In accordance with the habitat-dependent selection hypothesis, and
   previous work with great tits (Parus major), a close relative of the
   black-capped chickadee, our results suggest that fast-exploring birds
   may perform better in stable, predictable environments where forming a
   routine is advantageous, while slow-exploring birds are favoured in
   unstable, unpredictable environments, where task demands often change.
   Our results also support a hypothesis derived from previous work with
   great tits; slow-exploring birds may be generally more flexible (i.e.
   able to modify their behaviour in accordance with changes in
   environmental stimuli) in some learning tasks.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the hypotheses that a bold-shy personality axis exists
   in the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) and that dietary
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation has a significant effect on
   budgerigar personality and immune responses. DHA is an integral
   component of the brain known to impact cognitive function, and its
   impact on budgerigar behaviour is previously unstudied. Adult
   budgerigars (14 females, 9 males) were housed in two home pens and
   received either a control diet or a diet supplemented with DHA. The
   birds were tested in seven experimental situations designed to gauge
   boldness. Behavioural responses within the categories of fear, feeding
   and activity were recorded as well as immune status. Our results suggest
   that dietary DHA supplementation had no effects on the behavioural and
   immune variables measured in this study. The results do suggest that
   budgerigars have bold-shy personality traits for their activity and
   feeding behaviours, as indicated by significant correlations between
   percent of locations in the central area of the open field with activity
   in the presence of the familiar flock in the tendency to flock test
   (r(s) = 0.754, N=9, P<0.05), net distance travelled in the open field
   with activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock in the tendency to
   flock test (r(s) = -0.812, N=8, P<0.05), activity in the presence of the
   familiar flock and activity in the presence of the unfamiliar flock
   (r(s) = 0.838, N=10, P<0.05) and the number of seeds eaten alone and the
   number of seeds eaten in competition, both in the foraging and
   competition test (r(s) = 0.770, N = 11, P<0.05). Additionally,
   significant correlations between open field activity variables and fear
   variables measuring latencies may indicate that activity and fear
   variables are related. Finally, although there were several significant
   correlations between immune parameters and behavioural variables, the
   results were inconsistent with the hypothesis that immune status and
   personality are related in the budgerigar. In summary, our results
   indicate that DHA at the levels used had no effects on budgerigar
   personality or immune status. However, the results do provide evidence
   to support the hypothesis that budgerigar personality occurs as a
   bold-shy axis since budgerigars behaved consistently with regard to
   activity levels and, for males, feeding behaviour. Females showed a
   higher innate immunity as measured by the bactericidal activity of whole
   blood, while in males, this parameter was related to feeding behaviour.

Abstract = {{Studies on metabolism usually rely on measurements of oxygen consumption
   obtained in respirometry chambers. Despite rigorous standardization
   there is still considerable inter-individual variation in metabolic
   rates which is often ignored. Furthermore, housing in respirometry
   chambers implies handling and exposure to a new environment, conditions
   known to be a source of stress in animals. The extent of stress response
   is known to be dependent on an individual's coping style. Therefore, the
   extent of individual variation in respirometry data may be related to
   the expression of coping styles. The goal of this study is to determine
   whether the variation in oxygen consumption after a stressor is the
   resultant of an individual's coping style. Our approach was to determine
   oxygen consumption in fish immediately after transfer to respiratory
   chambers and during the subsequent 22 h. In addition, the same
   individuals were subjected to 3 respirometry runs (22 h each) to address
   the question whether habituation occurs when fish are used in multiple
   runs and whether habituation potential is linked to coping styles. The
   same individuals were then subjected to an acute stressor and the escape
   behaviour and plasma cortisol were determined to assess coping style.
   Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that individual
   variation in oxygen consumption in respirometry chambers are related to
   the expression of coping styles: individuals with higher oxygen
   consumption at the start and throughout the measurement period were
   shown to react passively (longer latency to escape) in a confinement
   stress. In addition, successive respirometry runs should not be assumed
   to result in habituation, as depending on an individual's coping style
   either habituation (in the case of passive copers) or sensitization (in
   the case of active copers) can occur. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Personality differences (i.e. consistent between-individual differences
   in behaviour) play an important role in the lives of humans and other
   animals, influencing both their day-to-day actions and their long-term
   reproductive success. For organisms living in highly structured groups
   of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects,
   personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while
   numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality,
   the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received
   little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective
   personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the
   presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of
   collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level
   personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed
   consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response,
   foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were
   correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these
   traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival.
   Our results show that the concept of collective personality is
   applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality
   differences among colonies can have important consequences for their
   long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality
   to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the
   structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role
   that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the
   evolution of behaviour. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Although behavioural plasticity should be an advantage in a varying
   world, there is increasing evidence for widespread stable individual
   differences in the behaviour of animals: that is, `personality'. Here we
   provide evidence suggesting that sexual selection is an important factor
   in the evolution of personality in species with biparental care. We
   carried out a cross-fostering breeding experiment on zebra finches,
   Taeniopygia guttata, and found that parental personality traits and the
   combination of personalities within breeding pairs had positive effects
   on correlates of (foster) offspring fitness (body mass and condition).
   Furthermore, these nongenetic parental effects were pervasive and
   carried over into the next generation. Our results suggest that
   similarity in behavioural traits of biparental species can have
   important, long-lasting effects on reproductive success, probably
   because of reduced sexual conflict over the provision of parental
   investment. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The concept of animal personalities has recently become of major
   interest as researchers began to wonder why animals within a given
   population show consistent behaviour across situations and contexts,
   what led to the evolution of such behavioural inflexibility and what
   mechanisms might underlie the phenomenon. A recent model explains
   individual differences in a population as the result of trade-off
   between present and future reproduction. We tested this model on the two
   wing morphs, i.e. short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged
   (macropterous) specimens of the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus). Since it
   has been already demonstrated that the two wing morphs differ in their
   life-history strategies, this species is an ideal subject to test
   whether the specimens with different life-history strategies have
   different personalities as well. The results show that individuals
   behave consistently over time and across contexts, meaning observed bugs
   do have personalities. We also have found that in females, the two wing
   morphs have different personalities supporting the theoretical
   predictions, i.e. winged ones, which are supposed to have lower future
   reproductive value, are braver and more exploratory. We found no
   difference between the morphs in males. Differences in reproductive
   investment might explain this discrepancy between the sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research focuses on animal personalities, that is individual
   differences in behaviour that are consistent across contexts and over
   time. From an adaptive perspective, such limited behavioural plasticity
   is surprising, since a more flexible structure of behaviour should
   provide a selective advantage. Here, we argue that consistency can be
   advantageous because it makes individuals predictable. Predictability,
   however, can only be advantageous if at least some individuals in the
   population respond to individual differences. Consequently, the
   evolution of consistency and responsiveness are mutually dependent. We
   present a general analysis of this coevolutionary feedback for scenarios
   that can be represented as matrix games with two pure strategies (e. g.
   hawk-dove game, snowdrift game). We first show that responsive
   strategies are favoured whenever some individual differences are present
   in the population (e. g. due to mutation and drift). We then show that
   the presence of responsive individuals can trigger a coevolutionary
   process between responsiveness and consistency that gives rise to
   populations in which responsive individuals coexist with unresponsive
   individuals who show high levels of adaptive consistency in their
   behaviour. Next to providing an adaptive explanation for consistency,
   our results also link two key features associated with personalities,
   individual differences in responsiveness and behavioural consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioural syndromes have experienced rapid
   increase in interest in the last few years because of their possible
   role in the evolution of life histories. However, there is still a
   scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in
   behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In
   this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on
   the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the
   identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus
   arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of
   family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family)
   on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in
   two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm
   maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The
   study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was
   consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE
   corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed
   behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by
   the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and
   maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family.
   It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here
   is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further
   studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole
   personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the
   opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in
   more natural circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the factors causing variation in behavioural
   plasticity and the interplay between personality and plasticity.
   Habituation to predators is a special case of behavioural plasticity. We
   investigated the direct and indirect effects of boldness, exploration
   and sociability traits on the habituation ability of Iberian wall
   lizards, considering exposure and sex effects. Individual boldness was
   consistent across several non-habituation contexts, but it did not
   significantly affect habituation. Exploration had a strong direct effect
   on habituation, with more exploratory individuals being able to
   habituate faster than less exploratory ones, probably because of their
   ability to assess risk better. Individual variation in habituation was
   also affected by sociability, but this was an indirect effect mediated
   by exposure to the predator. Less social individuals avoided refuges
   with conspecific cues, increasing exposure to the predator and
   eventually habituation. Finally, the direct effects of sex (females
   habituated faster than males) were opposite to its indirect effects
   through exposure. We conclude that risk assessment, instead of the
   proactivity-reactivity gradient usually considered in the literature,
   can affect behavioural plasticity through complex interactions between
   direct and indirect effects, including exploratory behaviour, degree of
   exposure to the predator and sex, which represent novel mechanisms
   generating inter-individual variation in plasticity.}},

Pages = {{1473-1489}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences, often referred to as behavioral
   syndromes, are characterized by individuals behaving in a consistent,
   predictable manner while differing from others. This phenomenon appears
   to conflict with the need to alter behavior based on experience or
   changes in the environment. It is possible that individuals will even
   exhibit `consistent flexibility' responding in the same manner each time
   they encounter a particular type of change or experience. However, few
   studies have examined how recent experiences might affect patterns of
   consistency and flexibility. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta
   splendens, exhibit consistent individual differences when presented with
   a male and female simultaneously as well as flexibility as these
   responses vary as a function of reproductive status. This study examined
   how recent experience with a female affects behavior in the presence of
   conflicting stimuli in the form of dummy male and female conspecifics.
   Males received multiple trials before exposure to a female as well as
   after they interacted with a live female conspecific. Overall rate of
   behavior was unaffected by exposure to a female. Males did not alter
   their relative level of responses to either dummy after experience with
   the female, as indicated by positive correlations before and after
   exposure. Consistent individual differences for all female-directed
   behaviors increased after exposure to the female, as shown by higher
   repeatability scores. Consistency for male-directed behaviors was more
   resistant to experience. Finally, some males changed their behavioral
   strategy, suggesting males differ in their levels of behavioral
   flexibility. This has implications for our understanding of how
   experience affects levels of behavioral consistency and flexibility in
   both courtship and aggressive situations.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have examined the ecological and evolutionary bases for
   variation in animal personality. However, only a few such studies have
   examined how foraging parameters are influenced by different personality
   domains. In wild ungulates, the trade-off between the time spent on food
   intake and antipredator behaviour differs between individuals, but the
   underlying reason for this is not yet well understood. One possibility
   is that this trade-off reflects personality dimensions such as boldness.
   To relate foraging decisions to personality we measured personality and
   performed feeding experiments with familiar and novel food in familiar
   and novel situations. We measured personality traits in 15 tame fallow
   deer, using novel object tests (NO), behavioural observations (BO) and
   personality ratings (PR). Boldness dimensions were found using PR and
   NO, dominance dimensions were found using BO and PR, and a flexibility
   dimension was found using BO. Multitrait-multimethod analysis showed
   that similar dimensions were significantly correlated across different
   methods and that different dimensions were not significantly correlated,
   even if measured using the same method. We also found that novel food
   eaten in familiar situations and familiar food eaten in novel situations
   were strongly related to boldness but not dominance, flexibility or age.
   Thus the trade-off between the benefits of gaining more food and the
   costs of reduced vigilance or increased toxin ingestion reflect
   boldness. These findings highlight the nature of personality dimensions
   in ungulates and how boldness impacts foraging behaviour. (c) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Although personality has been defined as a suite of correlated
   behaviours, most studies of animal personality actually consider
   correlations between a few traits. We examined the repeatability and
   correlational structure of five potential personality traits (activity,
   neophobia, exploratory tendencies, risk-taking behaviour and obstinacy),
   in female zebra finches. In addition, we assessed to what extent
   personality influenced social dominance in a feeding context in this
   gregarious species. All personality traits were found to be highly
   repeatable within individuals. In addition, except for obstinacy, all of
   them were related to each other, thus defining a behavioural syndrome.
   Social dominance was predicted by personality, with proactive
   individuals being more likely to be dominant. Our results suggest that
   personality can be considered as a new static factor influencing
   within-group hierarchies. We finally discuss these results in terms of
   the consequences for the evolution of personalities and the need to take
   several traits into account to provide full descriptions of individual
   personality. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Consistent between-individual differences in context-general behavioral
   traits (often called personality traits) are particularly interesting
   for behavioral ecologists because they might show unexpected
   cross-context correlations and explain maladaptive behavior. In order to
   understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the
   heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive
   success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain
   variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to
   novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment.
   Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic
   variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair
   paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and
   nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well
   as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects
   had little influence on these components of reproductive success.
   However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational
   sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel
   object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the
   sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual
   selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We
   conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive
   success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, individual differences in behavior show remarkable
   consistency across situations and contexts (i.e., animal personality and
   behavioral syndromes). Studies on the association between personality
   traits and fitness-related measures in nature are, however, important to
   clarify the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. Here, we tested
   for correlations between 3 behavioral axes in brown trout ( Salmo
   trutta) parr: exploration tendency, behavioral flexibility, and
   aggressiveness. Next, we tested how these individual behaviors relate to
   social dominance and performance under natural conditions ( growth,
   survival, and movement). We found support for behavioral syndromes in
   brown trout with less explorative individuals being less aggressive and
   showing more flexible behavior. In addition, these low-explorative
   personality types grew faster than bolder conspecifics in the wild.
   Standardized aggression in the laboratory was a poor indicator of social
   dominance, and neither of these 2 traits affected performance in the
   wild. These results challenge the view that personality traits can be
   predicted by constant associations with life-history trade-offs (e.g.,
   boldness is linked with rapid growth). Moreover, our findings suggest
   that fitness predictions from laboratory measures of behavior should be
   made with caution and ideally tested in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression often shows large inter-individual variation, but high
   intra-individual consistency. Although the physiological basis and
   direct costs of aggression are generally well known, less is known about
   the physiological costs such as increased oxidative stress (OS). This
   can occur via increased leakage of oxidants during high metabolic
   demands such as physical activity, or by hormones regulating both
   metabolism and aggression. Here we address this within a natural
   population of White's skinks, Egernia whitii; a species in which both
   sexes exhibit consistent aggressive phenotypes, and sex-specific
   associations between testosterone and aggression. The results reveal
   that males' aggressive phenotype, independent of testosterone, was
   positively associated with antioxidant capacity (OXY), while there was
   no significant association in females. Oxidative damage (ROM) and
   oxidative stress index (OI), were not influenced by aggressive phenotype
   or testosterone, but showed borderline positive associations with body
   size (i.e., age). The results failed to show that high testosterone
   increases OS. Instead, OS may be related to sex-specific behavioural
   patterns associated with aggressive phenotype such as territory and mate
   acquisition. Although experimental work is needed to identify the causal
   links for these patterns, the results highlight the need to consider
   proximate mechanisms to understand constraints on phenotypic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The study of animal personality has attracted considerable attention, as
   it has revealed a number of similarities in personality between humans
   and several nonhuman species. At the same time the adaptive value and
   evolutionary maintenance of different personalities are the subject of
   debate. Since Pavlov's work on dogs, students of comparative cognition
   have been aware that animals display vast individual differences on
   cognitive tasks, and that these differences may not be entirely
   accounted for differences in cognitive abilities. Here, we argue that
   personality is an important source of variation that may affect
   cognitive performance and we hypothesise mutual influences between
   personality and cognition across an individual's lifespan. In
   particular, we suggest that: 1) personality profiles may be markers of
   different cognitive styles; 2) success or failure in cognitive tasks
   could affect different personalities differently; 3) ontogenetic changes
   of personality profiles could be reflected in changes in cognitive
   performance. The study of such interplay has implications in animal
   welfare as well as in neuroscience and in translational medicine

Abstract = {{Individuals often differ consistently in behaviour across time and
   contexts, and such consistent behavioural differences are commonly
   described as personality. Personality can play a central role in social
   behaviour both in dyadic interactions and in social networks. We
   investigated whether explorative behaviour, as proxy of personality of
   territorial male great tits (Parus major), predicts their own and their
   neighbours' territorial responses towards simulated intruders. Several
   weeks prior to playback, subjects were taken from the wild to test their
   exploratory behaviour in a standard context in the laboratory.
   Exploratory behaviour provides a proxy of personality along a slow-fast
   explorer continuum. Upon release, males were radio-tracked and
   subsequently exposed to interactive playback simulating a more or a less
   aggressive territorial intruder (by either overlapping or alternating
   broadcast songs with the subjects' songs). At the same time, we
   radio-tracked a neighbour of the playback subject. Male vocal responses
   during playback and spatial movements after playback varied according to
   male explorative behaviour and playback treatment. Males with lower
   exploration scores approached the loudspeaker less, and sang more songs,
   shorter songs and songs with slower element rates than did males with
   higher exploration scores. Moreover, neighbour responses were related to
   the explorative behaviour of the subject receiving the playback but not
   to their own explorative behaviour. Our overall findings reveal for the
   first time how personality traits affect resource defence within a
   communication network providing new insights on the cause of variation
   in resource defence behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that many vertebrates and a few invertebrates show
   individual-specific consistency in their behaviour across time and
   context, sometimes in ways that can be paralleled with human
   personality. Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a
   social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a
   behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response
   of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a
   foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower
   colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As
   for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel
   stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to
   known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model,
   we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response
   to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour
   over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used
   here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal
   personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural
   response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day
   basis. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{905-912}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The open-field test, which measures animal activity or distance covered
   by individuals subjected to a novel arena, is used frequently in
   behaviour studies. Studies generally report consistent individual
   differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested
   whether individuals change their activity level differently within a
   single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability
   of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the
   duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction
   norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in
   temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual
   temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias
   striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the
   total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time
   intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5
   min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain
   differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first
   time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated
   with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests
   yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend
   analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity
   measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity
   patterns. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are interindividual behavioral differences that are
   consistent across time or contexts. Increasing research is revealing the
   adaptive significance of personalities, although the mechanisms driving
   this variation remain largely unknown. A possible source of variation in
   personality traits is interpopulational differences in the strength of
   selection acting upon them. The response to selection can be measured
   indirectly via the behavior's repeatability, as repeatability generally
   sets an upper limit to trait heritability. However, no information
   currently exists on geographic variation in personality repeatability.
   We therefore quantified repeatability in exploratory behavior, a common
   personality trait, over multiple trials for 3 populations of
   rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), focusing on 3 specific
   measures (exploration speed, diversity of perches visited, and number of
   hops). We also asked how differences in repeatability of these 3
   measures affect other aspects of exploration, such as the temporal
   consistency of intercorrelations between the measures. Exploration speed
   was highly repeatable across all populations, whereas diversity was only
   repeatable in 2 of 3 populations and hopping behavior not at all. These
   differences in repeatability lead to temporal variation in the
   correlation matrices of the 3 exploration measures. Finally, only trial
   number influenced interindividual variability in exploration, whereas
   population identity, experimental conditions (i.e., conducting the novel
   environment assay under laboratory or field conditions), and time since
   capture all had no effect. Our findings highlight the complexity of
   using measures of behavioral consistency as a definition of
   personalities and emphasize the value of quantifying interpopulational
   patterns of trait repeatability.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in exploration behavior can affect fitness, can be
   individually consistent and heritable, and is increasingly measured as
   an animal personality trait in novel environment tests. Exploration
   speed in novel environment tests is generally found to be positively
   correlated with movement distances in wild animals, but such studies
   tend to be limited to single measures of exploration and rarely
   investigate the role of other correlates of movement behavior in the
   wild. We show that scores of the speed of exploration of wild juvenile
   starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in novel environment tests are not
   correlated with either the maximum extent of, or the size of the most
   frequently used part of, their home range. By contrast, scores that
   reflect what parts of the novel environment were explored are correlated
   with the size of the most frequently used area and tend to be correlated
   with the maximum home range size. The latter relationship was stronger
   for individuals that were on average found in larger flocks and for
   individuals with less suitable foraging habitat in their range. We
   conclude that aspects of exploration other than its speed may be better
   predictors of exploration in the wild for some species. Moreover, our
   findings further illustrate that the association between animal
   personality traits such as exploration behavior and the behavioral
   ecology of wild animals may depend on the environmental or social
   context. These findings are discussed in the context of individual
   variation in the response to environmental variability.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural syndromes describe consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioural traits. Quantifying individual differences
   often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity
   while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared
   behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short-and
   long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological
   contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was
   similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the
   presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap,
   respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel
   object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of
   annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home
   territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across
   ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a
   behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and
   exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in
   risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a
   familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate
   measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term
   responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in
   related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated
   ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context
   specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome
   sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide
   opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types,
   including trap-shy individuals. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{757-767}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes is little studied in
   cooperative breeding systems where it is assumed that the behavioural
   type might influence individual decisions on helping and dispersal (e.g.
   shy, nonaggressive and nonexplorative individuals remain philopatric and
   helpful, whereas bold, aggressive, explorative individuals compete for
   vacancies outside their group and disperse). We measured the behavioural
   type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish
   Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six
   behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different
   contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or
   nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context
   repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal
   individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or
   the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the
   tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits
   per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the
   across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except
   for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the
   context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could
   be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction
   towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies
   in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not
   included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are
   needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration
   propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and
   dispersal). (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Consistent inter-individual variation in behaviour over time and across
   contexts has been reported for a wide variety of animals, a phenomenon
   commonly referred to as personality. As behavioural patterns develop
   inside families, rearing conditions could have lasting effects on the
   expression of adult personality. In species with parental care,
   conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and
   offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the
   interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness,
   exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside
   the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside
   families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to
   offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences.
   Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically
   observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and
   dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which
   may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings.
   However, there has been little research on how personality relates to
   parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on
   how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and
   offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life.}},

Abstract = {{In animal communication, sexually selected signals have been shown to
   often signal individual attributes such as motivation or quality.
   Birdsong is among the best studied signalling systems, and song traits
   vary substantially among individuals. The question remains if variation
   in signalling also reflects more general and consistent individual
   characteristics. Such consistent individual differences in behaviour
   that are relatively stable over time and contexts are referred to as
   personality or behavioural syndromes. Here, we studied the relation
   between singing and explorative behaviour, a well-studied personality
   trait, using great tits (Parus major) under standardized aviary
   conditions. The results show that singing activity measured as the
   number of songs sung in spring prior to breeding correlated with male
   but not with female explorative behaviour. In contrast, song repertoire
   was not related to explorative behaviour but varied over the day. The
   link between explorative and singing behaviour suggests that sexually
   selected signals are more than signals of quality but can also reflect
   other intrinsic behavioural characteristics such as personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{According to basic evoludonary theory, individuals within a population
   should adapt their behavior in response to their current physical and
   social environment. However, there is now evidence from a diverse range
   of taxa that behavior is instead constrained by individuals' broad
   behavioral syndromes or personalities. Bold individuals are generally
   shown to take greater risks than shy individuals. Theory suggests that
   there should be fitness trade-offs associated with personalities. We
   aimed to answer the following 3 questions using the Namibian rock agama
   (Agama planiceps) as a study species: 1) Is the boldness of individual
   male agamas repeatable? 2) Do male agamas show a behavioral syndrome?
   and 3) Are there any possible fitness trade-offs associated with
   individual behavioral syndromes. We measured boldness of 30 male agamas
   by quantifying flight initiation distance. We found that individual
   agama behavior was significantly consistent through time. Also, bolder
   males were found to spend significantly more time basking and moving
   throughout their home ranges in sight of predators, indicating a
   behavioral syndrome in this species. Bolder males also had larger home
   ranges and fed more than shyer males but suffered higher levels of tail
   loss, possibly clue to predation. The rates of visual signaling in the
   form of assertion displays of bolder and shyer males did not differ. We
   suggest that males of this species show a significant behavioral
   syndrome that may lead to fitness trade-offs. Key words: Agama
   planiceps, behavioral syndrome, boldness, individual variation,
   personality. {[}Behav Ecol 21:655-661 (2010)]}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms by which group-living animals collectively exploit
   resources, and the role of individuals in group decisions, are central
   issues for understanding animal distribution patterns. We investigated
   the extent to which boldness and shyness affect the distribution of
   social herbivores across vegetation patches, using sheep as a model
   species. Using an experimental and a theoretical approach, we show that
   collective choices emerge through the nonlinear dynamics of interactions
   between individuals, at both short and long distances. Within a range of
   parameter values derived from the observation of homogeneous groups of
   each behavioural type, we propose a simple mechanism whereby the same
   interaction rules can result in different patterns of distribution
   across patches for bold and shy individuals. We present a mathematical
   model based on behavioural rules derived from experiments, in which
   crowding and con-specific attraction affect the probability of entering
   or leaving patches. Variation in the strength of social attraction is
   sufficient to account for differences in spatial distribution across
   patches. The model predicts that resource fragmentation more strongly
   affects the distribution patterns of shy groups, and suggests that the
   presence of both bold and shy individuals within groups would result in
   more flexible behaviour at the population level.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the ecological significance of personality, researchers
   generally measure behavioural traits in captivity. Whether behaviour in
   captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom
   tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild
   in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were
   briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and
   neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then
   released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an
   electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of
   feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery
   of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild.
   At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia
   in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was
   independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or
   weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual
   exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in
   captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all
   constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and
   neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or
   the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in
   contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia
   measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured
   in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities,
   personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in
   foraging behaviour between individuals. (C) 2009 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Most studies of animal personality attribute personality to genetic
   traits. But a recent study by Magnhagen and Staffan (Behav Ecol
   Sociobiol 57:295-303, 2005) on young perch in small groups showed that
   boldness, a central personality trait, is also shaped by social
   interactions and by previous experience. The authors measured boldness
   by recording the duration that an individual spent near a predator and
   the speed with which it fed there. They found that duration near the
   predator increased over time and was higher the higher the average
   boldness of other group members. In addition, the feeding rate of shy
   individuals was reduced if other members of the same group were bold.
   The authors supposed that these behavioral dynamics were caused by
   genetic differences, social interactions, and habituation to the
   predator. However, they did not quantify exactly how this could happen.
   In the present study, we therefore use an agent-based model to
   investigate whether these three factors may explain the empirical
   findings. We choose an agent-based model because this type of model is
   especially suited to study the relation between behavior at an
   individual level and behavioral dynamics at a group level. In our model,
   individuals were either hiding in vegetation or feeding near a predator,
   whereby their behavior was affected by habituation and by two social
   mechanisms: social facilitation to approach the predator and competition
   over food. We show that even if we start the model with identical
   individuals, these three mechanisms were sufficient to reproduce the
   behavioral dynamics of the empirical study, including the consistent
   differences among individuals. Moreover, if we start the model with
   individuals that already differ in boldness, the behavioral dynamics
   produced remained the same. Our results indicate the importance of
   previous experience and social interactions when studying animal
   personality empirically.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that differences in life history may lead to
   consistent inter-individual variation in behavioural traits, so-called
   behavioural syndromes, animal personalities or temperaments.
   Consistencies of behaviours and behavioural syndromes have mainly been
   studied in non-cooperative species. Insights on the evolution of
   cooperation could be gained from studying individual differences in life
   histories and behavioural traits. Kin selection theory predicts that if
   an individual's reproductive ability is low, it had to aim at gaining
   inclusive fitness benefits by helping others. We tested this prediction
   in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, by
   assessing reproductive parameters of adults that had been tested earlier
   for aggressiveness and for their propensity to assist breeders when they
   had been young ('juveniles'). We found that juvenile aggression levels
   predicted the acceptance of a subordinate in the group when adult. Males
   which were aggressive as juveniles were significantly more likely to
   tolerate a subordinate in the group when compared with males which were
   peaceful as juveniles, whereas females which were more aggressive as
   juveniles tended to expel subordinates more often. Females produced
   significantly smaller clutches when paired to males which had helped
   more as a juvenile, despite the fact that adult males hardly provided
   direct brood care. There was no evidence that females with a high
   propensity to help when young, produced smaller clutches or eggs when
   adult, but they took longer to lay their first clutch when compared with
   females with a low propensity to help when young. These results suggest
   that variation in behavioural types might explain variation in
   cooperation, the extent of group-living and reproductive decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Animals foraging in groups can either search for food themselves
   (producing) or search for the food discoveries of other individuals

   but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different
   conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use
   in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and
   scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis),
   where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time
   in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate
   based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food
   patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the
   outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and
   their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining
   than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality
   is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold
   individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our
   results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural
   variation in models of producer-scrounger games.}},

Abstract = {{Research on behavioural syndromes (consistent individual differences in
   suites of correlated behaviours) requires formal statistical methods to
   describe and compare syndrome structures. We detail the shortcomings of
   current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes,
   such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis
   (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework
   involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation
   matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific
   hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural
   syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances
   across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their
   unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these
   methods using an already published data set for two groups of
   populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living
   in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a
   lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the
   absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of
   how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that
   the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance
   patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered
   environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and
   activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on
   conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline
   here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of
   behavioural syndromes within and between populations. (C) 2009 The

Abstract = {{While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in
   recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the
   outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In
   particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality
   differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of
   male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual
   differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank,
   which partially determines mating success in this species. The
   expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female
   courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number
   of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of
   courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65,
   respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating
   context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of
   mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males
   showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in
   the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither
   behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or
   body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in
   the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural
   phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than
   short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food
   or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or
   genetic basis. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in behaviour, termed personality, are
   common in animal populations and can constrain their responses to
   ecological and environmental variation, such as temperature. Here, we
   show for the first time that normal within-daytime fluctuations in
   temperature of less than 3 degrees C have large effects on personality
   for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and
   manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three
   personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness,
   increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However,
   whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across
   temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the
   individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality.
   In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature
   contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended
   to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the
   importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying
   behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that
   individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal
   personality, given that temperature has large direct effects on
   metabolic rates in ectotherms.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent locomotion, characterized by moves interspersed with
   pauses, is a common pattern of locomotion in animals, but its ecological
   and evolutionary significance relative to continuous locomotion remains
   poorly understood. Although many studies have examined individual
   differences in both intermittent locomotion and boldness separately, to
   our knowledge, no study to date has investigated the relationship
   between these 2 traits. Characterizing and understanding this
   relationship is important, as both locomotion and boldness are
   associated with several ecologically relevant behaviors such as
   foraging, mating, predator evasion, exploration, and dispersal. Here, we
   report on individual differences in boldness (risk-taking behavior) and
   intermittent locomotion in a novel laboratory environment in
   field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Our
   results show that juvenile bluegill sunfish exhibited individual-level
   variation in 2 modes of intermittent locomotion (undulatory and
   labriform swimming) and that this variation was correlated with
   differences in their boldness behavior. Generally, bolder individuals
   spent more time moving fast for longer durations and with shorter pauses
   than more timid individuals. Neither boldness nor locomotion was
   correlated with body size or body condition. This study provides the
   first empirical evidence for a link between an animal ``personality{''}
   trait and intermittent locomotion.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{367-382}},
Abstract = {{The lifecycles of parasites are often complex, with multiple successive
   hosts. Many parasites have evolved the ability to modify the behaviour
   of their present host to increase the chance of transmission to the next
   host. Few studies to date have considered how a suite of related
   behavioural traits in the host can be affected by parasitic
   manipulations. The present study investigated the effect of two
   trematode parasites, Coitocaecum parvum and Microphallus sp., on the
   behaviour of their amphipod host (Paracalliope fluviatilis) in a
   behavioural syndrome framework. This framework focused on the
   correlations between, and repeatabilities within suites of behavioural
   traits. Three activity-related behavioural tests were conducted:
   phototaxis (response to light), horizontal activity, and vertical
   distribution. Infection by C. parvum did not have any significant effect
   on any of the behavioural traits investigated. However, amphipods
   infected by Microphallus sp. spent less time in the light. Surprisingly,
   amphipods harbouring Microphallus sp. also showed stronger behavioural
   correlations in general, compared to those of uninfected hosts.
   Furthermore, the repeatability of the phototaxis test for infected
   amphipods was lower than that of uninfected amphipods. Given these
   results, we encourage future studies to use this behavioural syndrome
   framework.}},

   their adaptive value and evolutionary maintenance are the subject of

Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour (often referred to as
   `temperament' or `personality') has increasingly been shown to be
   relevant to understanding patterns of behaviour that may influence
   survival and reproductive success. Although observer ratings on
   expert-nominated behavioural descriptors have been successfully used to
   identify and measure temperament traits in non-human primates and other
   species, some researchers argue that these measurements may be
   contaminated by observer bias both in the nomination of descriptors and
   in ratings of individual animals by the observers. Instead, it has been
   suggested that a better means of measuring temperament relies on a
   bottom-up approach based on direct, quantitative measurements of a
   species' behavioural repertoire. In this study, we compare the utility
   of a trait-nomination-and-ratings approach and an approach using direct
   behavioural observation for identifying and describing the patterning of
   temperament traits a captive population of cockatiels (Nymphicus
   hollandicus). Our data show that the nomination-based and the
   behavioural repertoire-based approaches yield very similar pictures of
   the patterning of temperament traits in cockatiels, although trait
   scales generated using the nomination-and-ratings approach have higher
   internal consistency. Additionally, trait scores on both the behavioural
   repertoire-based trait scales and the nomination/ratings-based trait
   scales show reasonable power to predict observed behaviour, consistent
   with findings in both humans and non-human animals. The
   nomination/ratings approach seems to be more powerful in predicting
   birds' behaviour towards novel objects. While further validation is
   certainly needed, the present results suggest that both methods may have
   some utility for describing temperament in cockatiels.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are known to exhibit `personality'; that is, individual
   differences in behaviour that are consistent across time and/or
   situations. One axis of personality of particular importance for
   behavioural ecology is boldness, which can be defined as the tendency of
   an individual to take risks. The relationship between individual
   personality and fitness correlates, particularly those involved in
   reproduction, remains largely unexplored. In the current study, we used
   female Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to ascertain whether
   certain reproductive traits (e.g. stage of pregnancy, fecundity) are
   correlated with individual personality in two wild populations in New
   South Wales, Australia. To quantitatively assess this relationship, we
   tested individual fish for their level of boldness, as measured by their
   latency to exit a refuge and tendency to shoal in a novel environment.
   We also quantified individual differences in general activity and
   tendency to swim near the water surface and substratum. For both
   populations taken together, bolder individuals tended to be smaller,
   relatively less fecund (when taking body size into account), and spent
   more time near the water surface than near the substratum compared with
   timid individuals. Individual boldness was not correlated with either
   general activity or stage of pregnancy. To our knowledge, our study
   characterizes for the first time a relationship between an individual
   personality trait (boldness) and a reproductive fitness correlate
   (fecundity) in fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variation in exploratory behaviour has been demonstrated in a
   diverse array of animal species. Understanding the evolutionary
   antecedents and ecological consequences of this variation is an active
   research area within animal behaviour. Here we investigate whether
   different exploration styles exhibited by black-capped chickadees
   (Poecile atticapillus) in a novel environment are related to how quickly
   these birds learn an acoustic discrimination task. We found that birds
   that readily enter a novel environment learn an acoustic discrimination
   task faster than birds that do not readily enter a novel environment.
   This result contrasts with previous work suggesting no correlation
   between exploration style and learning a spatial or associative task in
   great tits (Parus major), a close relative of the black-capped

Abstract = {{Recently emerged brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) foraging in
   still-water pools along the sides of streams tend to be sedentary,
   feeding from the lower portion of the water column (sitting and
   waiting), or active, feeding from the upper portion of the water column
   (active search). Individuals exhibiting intermediate behavior are
   observed less frequently. We assessed the perceptual, energetic, and
   locomotor bases of the individual differences in foraging tactics by
   testing whether an individual's activity while searching for prey in the
   field was linked to its willingness to take risks, resting metabolic
   rate (RMR), and swimming capacity. Proportion of time an individual
   spent moving during prey search was quantified in the field, the
   individual was captured, and willingness to take risks (field), resting
   oxygen consumption (lab), and locomotor ability (lab) were measured.
   Individuals that spent a lesser proportion of time moving in the field
   took longer to exit from a dark tube into an unfamiliar field
   environment, and delayed their exit times more in response to a novel
   object, than did individuals that spent a greater proportion of time
   moving in the field. Proportion of time spent moving in the field was
   unrelated to resting oxygen consumption and swimming capacity measured
   in the laboratory. Dispositions in foraging behavior and risk taking
   early in life could influence encounter rates with novel prey and
   habitats, which are important steps in the initial stages of resource
   polymorphisms.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Personality in animal behaviour describes the observation that
   behavioural differences between individuals are consistent over time and
   context. Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among
   individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that
   some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship
   between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured
   several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese,
   Branta leucopsis. We measured body size and scored the dominance of
   individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to
   an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a
   leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in
   pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability
   for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly
   correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity
   or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that
   leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality.
   Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected
   not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by
   the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that
   movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the
   personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement
   patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types
   present in the group. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published on behalf of

Abstract = {{Suites of correlated behaviors, or ``behavioral syndromes,{''} have been
   shown to occur throughout the animal kingdom. Behavioral syndromes
   involving sexual selection are expected to have significant evolutionary
   ramifications, but few studies have linked behavioral syndromes to
   sexual selection. We measured the behavior of male hissing cockroaches
   (Gromphadorhina portentosa) during male-male competition, female choice,
   and 3 other ecologically relevant contexts and quantified
   between-context correlations in behavior. We found that aggression
   directed toward an opponent and retreat and courtship elicited from an
   opponent were repeatable among males, suggesting that individuals
   exhibit stable behavioral types in the context of male-male interaction.
   Our analyses also revealed a ``fast-slow{''} syndrome, linking behavior
   in a self-righting context to behavior in a foraging context. In
   contrast to data from several other species, fast-slow scores in hissing
   cockroaches were not correlated with aggression in a male-male context.
   Finally, we identified a new type of behavioral syndrome, which we call
   ``libido.{''} Libido was defined by a positive relationship between
   courtship directed toward opponents in a male-male context and courtship
   directed toward potential mating partners in a male-female context.
   Among males that copulated, libido scores predicted reproductive
   success. We conclude that the libido syndrome, coupled with sexual
   selection favoring high courtship intensity in a male-female context,
   may be responsible for the persistence of male-male courtship behavior
   in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities, defined as consistent and correlated individual
   differences in behavioral traits, are suggested to be common in the
   animal kingdom and can have important fitness consequences. Individual
   differences in sensitivity to environmental cues are predicted to be
   part of animal personalities and are important because they will affect
   an individual's ability to respond to environmental change. Such
   environmental sensitivity as a personality trait needs further study
   because existing studies have rarely directly related environmental
   sensitivity to well-established personality traits such as exploration
   behavior and have focused on captive animals of specific model species.
   Using standardized assays of exploration behavior, we show that
   individual variation in 1) the speed of exploration behavior and 2) the
   parts of the environment that are explored are repeatable in juvenile
   wild starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Environmental sensitivity was
   measured in separate assays and was not correlated with the speed of
   exploration behavior. Instead, environmental sensitivity was strongly
   predicted by what part of the environment was used during the preceding
   exploration behavior assays. Thus, in juvenile wild starlings,
   behavioral traits other than the speed of exploration behavior better
   predicted environmental sensitivity. These results suggest that the
   relevance of exploration behavior as a personality trait may not be
   easily generalized across species. Furthermore, although unrelated to
   exploration speed, this study illustrates how environmental sensitivity
   correlates with well-known personality traits and thus further
   highlights how animal personalities can limit behavioral phenotypic
   plasticity in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite burgeoning interest in consistent individual differences in
   behaviour (animal `personality'), the influence of social interactions
   on the performance of different behavioural types is poorly understood.
   Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality
   differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the
   possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit
   personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received
   serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing
   selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch,
   we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration)
   between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts,
   the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex
   companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to
   behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of
   individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more
   exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory
   tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently
   across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though
   individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory
   behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion,
   the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of
   exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also
   affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results
   stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and
   of considering the influence of social context in animal personality
   studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of
   the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and
   evolutionary context. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The concept of behavioural syndromes hypothesizes that consistent
   behaviours across various situations mediate important life history
   trade-offs, and predicts correlations among behavioural traits. We
   studied the consistency of behavioural responses across three ecological
   situations (exploration of an environment altered with a novel object,
   aggression towards conspecifics, risk taking) in male collared
   flycatchers. We developed behavioural tests that could be applied in the
   birds' natural habitat, thus not requiring the capture of animals.
   Across individuals, we found positive covariation between exploration,
   aggression and risk taking, but the magnitude of these relationships
   varied. Variation in behaviour was also related to capture probability.
   Exploratory and risk-taking individuals were more likely to enter a trap
   than individuals with averse characteristics. Moreover, with the trapped
   birds, there was an association between the time needed for successful
   capture and exploration, and we found stronger correlations between
   behaviours in comparison with effects calculated from the whole sample
   of individuals. These patterns were independent of territory quality,
   male age, condition and breeding experience. Consequently, behavioural
   responses to different ecosocial challenges are determined by
   individual-specific characteristics that are manifested in correlative
   behaviours. Hence, behavioural types may be potential subjects for
   reproductive and life history adaptations. Our results have important
   implications for field studies of animals, because they suggest that
   capturing protocols may not randomly sample the observed population. (C)

Abstract = {{Interest in the evolution and maintenance of personality is burgeoning.
   Individuals of diverse animal species differ in their aggressiveness,
   fearfulness, sociability and activity. Strong trade-offs, mutation
   selection balance, spatio-temporal fluctuations in selection, frequency
   dependence and good-genes mate choice are invoked to explain heritable
   personality variation, yet for continuous behavioural traits, it remains
   unclear which selective force is likely to maintain distinct
   polymorphisms. Using a model of trust and cooperation, we show how
   allowing individuals to monitor each other's cooperative tendencies, at
   a cost, can select for heritable polymorphisms in trustworthiness. This
   variation, in turn, favours costly `social awareness' in some
   individuals. Feedback of this sort can explain the individual
   differences in trust and trustworthiness so often documented by
   economists in experimental public goods games across a range of
   cultures. Our work adds to growing evidence that evolutionary game
   theorists can no longer afford to ignore the importance of real world
   inter-individual variation in their models.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral lateralization, the preferential use of one hemisphere of the
   brain to perform certain cognitive functions, is a widespread and
   evolutionarily ancient adaptation. Lateralization appears to enhance
   cognitive capacity, yet substantial individual variation in the strength
   cerebral lateralization is apparent in all species studied so far. It is
   puzzling that cerebral lateralization, a seemingly advantageous trait,
   has not been driven to fixation. It has been suggested that variation in
   lateralization may be linked to individual variation in behaviour, which
   itself may be subject to disruptive selection. We examined the relation
   between cerebral lateralization and individual variation in boldness in
   the convict cichlid, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus. We show that convict
   cichlids that are more strongly lateralized when exploring a familiar
   environment, but not a novel one, are quicker to emerge from a shelter
   in a test for boldness. The possibility that cerebral lateralization is
   linked to life history strategy is discussed. (c) 2008 The Association

Abstract = {{Activity is an important behavioral trait that mediates a trade-off
   between obtaining food for growth and avoiding predation. Active
   individuals usually experience a higher encounter rate with food items
   and suffer higher predation pressure than less active individuals. I
   investigated how activity of the damselfly Lestes congener is affected
   by larval state and predator presence and if larval behavioral type (BT)
   can be used to predict larval boldness, foraging success, and adult BT.
   Activity level of individual larvae was studied without predator at 2
   different physiological states (hungry and fed) and in 2 predator
   treatments: familiar predator cues and unfamiliar predator cues. Larvae
   did not adjust their activity depending on state or when subjected to
   unfamiliar predator cues, but a general reduction in activity was seen
   in the familiar predator treatment. Hence, active individuals remained
   active compared with their conspecifics, independent of state or
   predator treatment. Active individuals were also bolder and more
   efficient foragers than their less active conspecifics. Furthermore,
   both adult activity and boldness were correlated with larval BT. The
   results illustrate that BT of a larvae is carried over many different
   situations keeping active larvae active even in maladaptive situations,
   demonstrating how a behavioral syndrome may constrain behavioral
   plasticity. Furthermore, results showed that behavioral syndromes can
   carry over from larvae through metamorphosis and dictate the BT of the
   adult.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The composition of an animal group can impact greatly on the survival
   and success of its individual members. Much recent work has concentrated
   on behavioral variation within animal populations along the bold/shy
   continuum. Here, we screened individual guppies, Poecilia reticulata,
   for boldness using an overhead fright stimulus. We created groups
   consisting of 4 bold individuals (bold shoals), 4 shy individuals (shy
   shoals), or 2 bold and 2 shy individuals (mixed shoals). The performance
   of these different shoal types was then tested in a novel foraging
   scenario. We found that both bold and mixed shoals approached a novel
   feeder in less time than shy shoals. Interestingly, we found that more
   fish from mixed shoals fed than in either bold or shy shoals. We suggest
   that this can be explained by the fact that nearly all the cases where
   one fish was followed into the feeder by another occurred within mixed
   shoals and that it was almost always a shy fish following a bold one.
   These results suggest clear foraging benefits to shy individuals through
   associating with bold ones. Surprisingly, our results also suggest
   potential foraging benefits to bold individuals through associating with
   shy individuals. This study highlights a possible mechanism by which
   interindividual variation in behavioral types is maintained in a
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have explored various aspects of animal
   personality and their ecological consequences. However, the processes
   responsible for the maintenance of personality variability within a
   population are still largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that
   social personality traits exist in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara)
   and that the variation in sociability provides an explanation for
   variable dispersal responses within a given species. However, we need to
   know the fitness consequences of variation in sociability across
   environmental contexts in order to better understand the maintenance of
   such variation. In order to achieve this, we investigated the
   relationship between sociability and survival, body growth and
   fecundity, in one-year-old individuals in semi-natural populations with
   varying density. `Asocial' and `social' lizards displayed different
   fitness outcomes in populations of different densities. Asocial lizards
   survived better in low-density populations, while social females
   reproduced better. Spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions
   might thus be the process underlying the maintenance of these
   personality traits within a population. Finally, we also discuss the
   position of sociability in a more general individual behavioural pattern
   including boldness, exploration and aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Animals differ in their behaviour comparable to how humans differ in
   personality: individuals consistently differ in suites of correlated
   traits. Relationships between `personality traits' and fitness imply
   that personality traits can evolve by means of natural selection. We
   studied whether animal personality is also involved in sexual selection.
   We investigated whether exploratory behaviour (an aspect of animal
   personality, ranging from `slow' to `fast') correlated with the
   occurrence of extrapair paternity (EPP) in broods of wild great tits. We
   expected that EPP rates should be highest for females mated with social
   partners of the same personality type (i. e. for slowe-slow or fast-fast
   pairs, but not other pair combinations). We found that the likelihood of
   EPP was highest for these pairs. Disassortative extrapair mating with
   respect to personality can be the consequence of several non-mutually
   exclusive processes. It might be caused by adaptive mate choice, which
   allows assortatively paired females to produce offspring with either
   more variable or more intermediate phenotypes, but it could also be the
   consequence of behavioural incompatibility between extreme behavioural
   phenotypes. Our findings indicate that personality differences play a
   role in the mechanism behind extrapair behaviours and we therefore
   conclude that it is now plausible that partner preference is based not
   only on morphological characteristics, but also on consistent
   behavioural traits or personality. (C) 2008 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Many phenotypic traits show plasticity but behaviour is often considered
   the `most plastic' aspect of phenotype as it is likely to show the
   quickest response to temporal changes in conditions or `situation'.
   However, it has also been noted that constraints on sensory acuity,
   cognitive structure and physiological capacities place limits on
   behavioural plasticity. Such limits to plasticity may generate
   consistent differences in behaviour between individuals from the same
   population. It has recently been suggested that these consistent
   differences in individual behaviour may be adaptive and the term `animal
   personalities' has been used to describe them. In many cases, however, a
   degree of both behavioural plasticity and relative consistency is
   probable. To understand the possible functions of animal personalities,
   it is necessary to determine the relative strength of each tendency and
   this may be achieved by comparison of statistical effect sizes for tests
   of difference and concordance. Here, we describe a new statistical
   framework for making such comparisons and investigate cross-situational
   plasticity and consistency in the duration of startle responses in the
   European hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus, in the field and the
   laboratory. The effect sizes of tests for behavioural consistency were
   greater than for tests of behavioural plasticity, indicating for the
   first time the presence of animal personalities in a crustacean model.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of studies have shown that individuals differ
   consistently in a suite of correlated behavioural traits across various
   contexts and situations. Yet, most work on animal personalities has been
   performed under laboratory conditions and still little is known about
   the ecological significance of differences in personality in the wild,
   and the behavioural mechanisms underlying possible fitness consequences.
   In this study, we investigated individual differences in personality in
   relation to nest defence behaviour in wild great tits. Nest defence is
   an important aspect of parental care and involves a trade-off between
   two fitness components (i.e. survival and reproduction). As a measure of
   personality we used exploratory behaviour in a novel environment as this
   has been shown to be correlated with several other behavioural traits
   including risk-taking and aggression, two important behavioural
   components of nest defence. We found that the intensity of alarm calling
   towards a human intruder was positively associated with exploratory
   behaviour, while there was a negative association between exploration
   score and number of movements during nest defence. Thus, fast explorers
   are shown to respond more boldly towards predators in the field. More
   generally we show that individuals with different personalities vary in
   their anti-predator and reproductive investment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Animals often differ from one another in their willingness to take risks
   in a number of functional contexts related to fitness (e.g. mating,
   dispersal, and foraging behaviour). Although several studies have
   reported life history correlates and selective consequences of this
   variation in shy/bold behaviour, little attention has been paid to
   developmental processes resulting in shy/bold phenotypes. Here, we
   present a lifetime developmental study of shy/bold behaviour in dumpling
   squid, Euprymna tasmanica. Behaviour was measured in two test contexts,
   a threat and a feeding test, at five times across the entire life span.
   Across test contexts, shy/bold behaviour was not correlated at any age;
   while within a test context, individual shy/ bold phenotypes were
   consistent both before and after sexual maturity. During sexual
   maturity, different phenotypes displayed different amounts of
   developmental variation; shyer animals were more plastic in feeding
   tests, while bolder animals were more plastic in threat ones. Our
   results suggest that for some animals shy/bold behaviour throughout
   development is uncorrelated across different contexts related to risk,
   while within a context, there may still be developmental constraints to
   changing shy/bold behaviour. This constraint within a functional
   context, however, may be phenotype-specific, with some phenotypes able
   to change more than others. These results indicate that a greater
   understanding of developmental pathways is needed to determine whether
   shy/bold phenotypes per se are the sole focus of selection. Differences
   in developmental plasticity between shy/bold phenotypes may also confer
   differential fitness in fluctuating environments. (c) 2007 The

Abstract = {{Using a multidisciplinary approach, the present study complements
   ethological behaviour measurements with basic theoretical concepts,
   methods and approaches of the personality psychological trait paradigm.
   Its adoptability and usefulness for animal studies are tested
   exemplarily on a sample of 20 zoo-housed great apes (five of each of the
   following species): bonobos, Pan paniscus; chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes
   verus; gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla; and orang-utans, Pongo
   pygmaeus abelii. Data on 76 single trait-relevant behaviours were
   recorded in a series of 14 laboratory-based situations and in two
   different group situations. Data collection was repeated completely
   after a break of 2 weeks within a 50-day period. All behaviour records
   were sufficiently reliable. Individual- and variable-oriented analyses
   showed high/substantial temporal stability on different levels of
   aggregation. Distinctive and stable individual situational and response
   profiles clarified the importance of situations and of multiple
   trait-relevant behaviours. The present study calls for a closer
   collaboration between behavioural biologists and personality
   psychologists to tap the full potential of animal personality research.

Abstract = {{Polymorphisms in several neurotransmitter-associated genes have been
   associated with variation in human personality traits. Among the more
   promising of such associations is that between the human dopamine
   receptor D4 gene (Drd4) variants and novelty-seeking behaviour. However,
   genetic epistasis, genotype environment interactions and confounding
   environmental factors all act to obscure genotype-personality
   relationships. Such problems can be addressed by measuring personality
   under standardized conditions and by selection experiments, with both
   approaches only feasible with non-human animals. Looking for similar
   Drd4 genotype-personality associations in a free-living bird, the great
   tit (Parus major), we detected 73 polymorphisms (66 SNPs, 7 indels) in
   the P. major Drd4 orthologue. Two of the P. major Drd4 gene
   polymorphisms were investigated for evidence of association with
   novelty-seeking behaviour: a coding region synonymous single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP830) and a 15 bp indel (ID15) located 50 to the
   putative transcription initiation site. Frequencies of the three Drd4
   SNP830 genotypes, but not the ID15 genotypes, differed significantly
   between two P. major lines selected over four generations for divergent
   levels of `early exploratory behaviour' (EEB). Strong corroborating
   evidence for the significance of this finding comes from the analysis of
   free-living, unselected birds where we found a significant association
   between SNP830 genotypes and differing mean EEB levels. These findings
   suggest that an association between Drd4 gene polymorphisms and animal
   personality variation predates the divergence of the avian and mammalian
   lineages. Furthermore, this work heralds the possibility of following
   microevolutionary changes in frequencies of behaviourally relevant Drd4
   polymorphisms within populations where natural selection acts
   differentially on different personality types.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are common across taxa and have important
   evolutionary and ecological implications. Such consistent individual
   differences correlate with important life-history traits such as
   dispersal. Indeed, some environmental conditions are supposed to
   determine dispersers with a specific personality. For example, an
   increased density should promote the departure of individuals with less
   social tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that dispersers from
   high-density populations should primarily be asocial individuals,
   whereas dispersers from low-density populations should be social
   individuals. In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we measured
   attraction towards the odour of conspecifics on juveniles at birth as a
   metric of social tolerance. We then released these juveniles into
   populations of different densities and measured dispersal and settlement
   behaviours with regard to social tolerance. One year later, we again
   measured the social tolerance of surviving individuals. The social
   tolerance is constant across time and strongly reflects the individual's
   dispersal and settlement patterns with respect to population density.
   These results strongly suggest that social personalities exist and
   influence dispersal decisions. Further studies will help to elucidate
   the proximate and ultimate determinants of social personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers with diverse interests in topics ranging from the formation
   of dominance hierarchies and social intelligence to animal personalities
   have predicted specific, and often conflicting, relations between social
   rank, neophobia and learning ability. We investigated the relations
   between these variables in captive groups of wild-caught starlings,
   Sturnus vulgaris, adopting a multidimensional approach to social rank
   and neophobia. Both agonistic and competitive rank orders were
   determined for each group and we tested individuals in the absence of
   their groupmates for object neophobia, latency to feed in a novel
   environment and performance on an extractive foraging task. In each
   starling group, the fastest learners occupied the highest competitive
   ranks, supporting the hypothesis that cognitive ability is positively
   correlated with social dominance. Competitive rank orders, however, did
   not correlate significantly with agonistic rank orders.
   Situation-specific foraging neophobia was suggested: individuals showed
   consistency in their latencies to feed near a variety of novel objects,
   but no significant correlation was found between this measure of object
   neophobia and latency to feed in a novel environment. Starlings fastest
   to feed in the novel environment were fastest in solving the foraging
   task. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers
   studying hierarchy formation in animal groups, social intelligence and
   animal personalities. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Recent attention has been drawn to the existence of individual
   differences in correlated behaviour across contexts, animal
   `personality' (Gosling 2001, Psychological Bulletin, 127, 45-86) and
   behavioural syndromes (Sih et al. 2004b, Quarterly Review of Biology,
   79, 241-277). The causes of these patterns of behaviour are subjects of
   debate. Here, we present a very simple model of how adaptively managing
   noisy information, combined with differences in individual state, can
   lead to evolutionarily stable differences in how individuals respond to
   environmental cues. When information is very noisy, behavioural
   syndromes are most likely, but as long as there is some error, some
   types of individuals display the same behaviour in all contexts. In
   extreme cases, very few individuals display flexible behaviour, and
   different stable behavioural types dominate the population. (c) 2006 The

Abstract = {{Recent progress has been made on the study of personality in animals,
   both from a mechanistic and a functional perspective. While we start
   knowing more about the proximal mechanisms responsible for the
   consistent differences in behaviour between individuals in a population,
   little is known yet about the relationship between the phenotypic
   distribution of personality traits, or combinations of traits, and
   fitness. Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the
   fitness consequences of personality traits in natural populations. We
   start by a description of two case studies that have examined the role
   of natural selection on personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great
   tit. Parus major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other
   studies that have reported some links between personality traits and
   fitness indices, in a large variety of animal species. We continue by
   outlining both direct approaches (i.e., measuring correlational
   selection on personality trait combinations) and indirect approaches
   (i.e., comparing correlations between personality traits within and
   between populations) to study suites of correlated traits from an
   adaptive perspective. This review, we hope, will be able to stimulate
   the use of the phenotypic selection analysis applied to the study of
   selection on personality traits in animals.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models are used to study the physiological mechanisms underlying
   disease progression. In this paper, I examine the benefits of using
   animal models to study how personality or stable individual differences
   (in behavior and physiology) influence disease susceptibility and
   resilience. Such an expansion of animal model use, to study the
   relationships among personality, physiology, and health, provides a
   unique complement to human studies. Human studies are necessarily
   correlational and involve minimally-invasive physiological measures,
   whereas animal studies can involve experimental manipulations of
   potentially causal variables. For example, with animal models, genetic
   and environmental precursors of personality can be manipulated to test
   how behavioral response biases affect health, and physiological
   parameters can be manipulated to observe resulting changes in behavioral
   traits and health. In addition to these experimental benefits, lifespan
   longitudinal studies can be conducted with short-lived animal models to
   address cumulative, potentially subtle effects of personality on health.
   In general, animal models allow for greater in-depth analyses of
   physiological processes underlying relationships between personality and
   health, and a means for determining causal mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Animal `personalities' or behavioural syndromes can be defined as
   individual differences in suites of correlated behaviours. Using
   chaffinches Fringilla coelebs temporarily held in captivity, we
   determined the extent to which activity level (AL), the behavioural
   response to a stressful situation (BRSS) and two anti-predation risk
   behaviours when exposed to a model predator were inter-correlated within
   individuals. We assayed AL and BRSS when the chaffinches were first put
   in an experimental room. Subsequently we recorded their initial response
   (freeze or escape) to the sudden appearance of a model hawk, in addition
   to their latency to resume activity afterwards as a measure of
   cautiousness ('latency'). Each bird was assayed in two situations that
   differed in the risk level posed and in the assumed optimal response
   required to minimize predation risk: (I) high risk, when the hawk flew
   directly over the chaffinch and the assumed optimal response was to
   escape; and (2) low risk, when the model hawk flew 2 m to the side of
   the chaffinch and, since the bird was not being targeted, the assumed
   optimal response was to freeze in order to avoid attracting attention.
   All of the variables had relatively high repeatabilities and were
   inter-correlated, providing strong evidence for a behavioural syndrome.
   Though propensity to freeze was much greater in the low risk treatment,
   AL was negatively correlated with freezing behaviour in both risk
   treatments, and therefore there was a `behavioural carryover' across
   situations. While hypoactive individuals were more likely to freeze in
   the low risk treatment, and were therefore assumed to be better able to
   assess risk compared to hyperactive individuals, some hypoactive
   individuals also froze in the high risk situation when it was assumed to
   be inappropriate to do so. Despite this apparently maladaptive behaviour
   in the high risk situation, overall hypoactive individuals showed a
   greater degree of behavioural plasticity across treatments compared to
   hyperactives. Taken together our results support the hypothesis of
   differential predation risk among personality types. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current interest in personalities, and
   for predation risk and group-living theories.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of many species differ consistently in their behavioral
   reaction to mild novel challenges. Suites of these behaviors are
   referred to as behavioral syndromes or personalities. Personality traits
   are often phenotypically and genetically correlated. Therefore, animal
   personalities are generally considered as broad characteristics, with
   one underlying genetical and physiological mechanism that is expressed
   across situations and contexts. Because there are carryover effects
   between situations, animals are not entirely flexible in their behavior
   in each situation. This may cause behaviors to seem nonadaptive in
   isolated situations. To test whether individuals with different
   personalities could react differently to changes in their environment,
   we Studied context dependence of personalities in the great tit (Parus
   major). We tested birds categorized as either fast or slow explorers for
   their latency to come back to a feeding table after a mild startle
   (risk-taking behavior) in a nonsocial followed by a social context. We
   found that the relation between exploratory behavior and risk-taking
   behavior depended on the social context. Females in general returned
   later in the social test, while male reaction to the presence of a
   conspecific was dependent on their behavioral type. Slow males thereby
   reacted to the behavior of the companion and fast males did not. These
   results show that although personalities have a rigid structure the
   relation between personality traits is context dependent. These results
   are discussed in the perspective of the adaptive significance and
   maintenance of personalities.}},

Abstract = {{The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) has been subjected to a huge range
   of selection pressures during domestication that has resulted in a
   considerable diversity in morphology and behaviour. This, together with
   the many uses the dog is put to in our society, makes the dog an
   interesting model for studies of animal personality. However, only a few
   attempts have been done to study individual differences in dogs. In this
   study, behavioural data from 15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds were
   used to investigate the existence of personality traits in dogs. The
   data were collected at a personality test that tested the dogs'
   reactions to strangers, ``fleeing{''} prey-like objects, and several
   potential fear- and aggression-eliciting stimuli. Factor analyses
   revealed the existence of five narrow traits: ``Playfulness{''},
   ``Curiosity/Fearlessness{''}, ``Chase-proneness{''}, ``Sociability{''}
   and ``Aggressiveness{''}. Higher-order factor analyses showed that all
   factors except ``Aggressiveness{''} were related to each other, creating
   a broad factor that influences behaviour in a range of situations. Both
   narrow and broad factors were found in a dataset including data from a
   large number of breeds, as well as within eight of Federation
   Cynologique Internationale's (FCI's) 10 breed groups. This indicates
   that the personality dimensions found in the study are general for the
   dog as a species. The finding of a major behavioural dimension in
   different groups of dog breeds, together with comparable results
   previously found for wolves (Canis lupus), suggests that the dimension
   is evolutionarily stable and has survived the varied selection pressures
   encountered during domestication. The broad factor is comparable to the
   shyness-boldness axis previously found in both humans and animals, and
   to human ``supertraits{''} (a combination of Extraversion and
   Neuroticism). The results of this study can be used to describe and
   compare individual dogs, as well as breeds. This, in turn, can be used
   in applications like selection of service dogs and breeding animals, as
   well as predicting behaviour problems in pet dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The qualitative assessment of animal behaviour summarizes the different
   aspects of an animal's dynamic style of interaction with the
   environment, using descriptors such as `confident', `nervous', `calm' or
   `excitable'. Scientists frequently use such terms in studies of animal
   personality and temperament, but, wary of anthropomorphism, are
   reluctant to do so in studies of animal welfare. We hypothesize that
   qualitative behaviour assessment, in describing behaviour as an
   expressive process, may have a stronger observational foundation than is
   currently recognized, and may be of use as an integrative welfare
   assessment tool. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the inter- and
   intraobserver reliability of spontanous qualitative assessments of pig,
   Sus scrofa, behaviour provided by nine naive observers. We used an
   experimental methodology called `free choice profiling' (FCP), which
   gives observers complete freedom to choose their own descriptive terms.
   Data were analysed with generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), a
   multivariate statistical technique associated with FCP. Observers
   achieved significant agreement in their assessments of pig behavioural
   expression in four separate tests, and could accurately repeat
   attributing expressive scores to individual pigs across these tests.
   Thus the spontaneous qualitative assessment of pig behaviour showed
   strong internal validity under our controlled experimental conditions.
   In conclusion we suggest that qualitative behaviour assessment reflects
   a `whole animal' level of organization, which may guide the
   intepretation of behavioural and physiological measurements in terms of
   an animal's overall welfare state. (C) 2001 The Association for the
