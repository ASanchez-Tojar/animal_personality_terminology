Abstract = {{A behavioral syndrome is a suite of correlated behaviors expressed
   either within a given behavioral context (e.g., correlations between
   foraging behaviors in different habitats) or across different contexts
   (e.g., correlations among feeding, antipredator mating, aggressive, and
   dispersal behaviors). For example, some individuals (and genotypes)
   might be generally more aggressive, more active or bold, while others
   are generally less aggressive, active or bold. This phenomenon has been
   studied in detail in humans, some primates, laboratory rodents, and some
   domesticated animals, but has rarely been studied in other organisms,
   and rarely examined from an evolutionary or ecological perspective.
   Here, we present an integrative overview on the potential importance of
   behavioral syndromes in evolution and ecology. A central idea is that
   behavioral correlations generate tradeoffs; for example, an aggressive
   genotype might do well in situations where high aggression is favored,
   but might be inappropriately aggressive in situations where low
   aggression is favored (and vice versa for a low aggression genotype).
   Behavioral syndromes can thereby result in maladaptive behavior in some
   contexts, and potentially maintain individual variation in behavior in a
   variable environment. We suggest terminology and methods for studying
   behavioral syndromes, review examples, discuss evolutionary and
   proximate approaches for understanding behavioral syndromes, note
   insights from human personality research, and outline some potentially
   important ecological implications. Overall, we suggest that behavioral
   syndromes could play a useful role as an integrative bridge between
   genetics, experience, neuroendocrine mechanisms, evolution, and ecology.}},

Title = {{Repeatability for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data: a practical guide for

Abstract = {{Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the
   intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for
   quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of
   phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be
   attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a
   consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the
   sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several
   ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no
   formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for
   non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition
   to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors
   and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability
   estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the
   methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for
   Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three
   common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model
   (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on
   generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation
   of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We
   also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors,
   confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and
   recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests
   and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based
   approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables
   can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of
   repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in
   relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a
   collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate
   repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.}},

Abstract = {{The author explores the viability of a comparative approach to
   personality research. A review of the diverse animal-personality
   literature suggests that (a) most research uses trait constructs,
   focuses on variation within (vs. across) species, and uses either
   behavioral codings or trait ratings; (b) ratings are generally reliable
   and show some validity (7 parameters that could influence reliability
   and 4 challenges to validation are discussed); and (c) some dimensions
   emerge across species, but summaries are hindered by a lack of standard
   descriptors. Arguments for and against cross-species comparisons are
   discussed, and research guidelines are suggested. Finally, a research
   agenda guided by evolutionary and ecological principles is proposed. It
   is concluded that animal studies provide unique opportunities to examine
   biological, genetic, and environmental bases of personality and to study
   personality change, personality-health links, and personality
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are
   not only found in humans(1) but also in a wide range of other animal
   species(2-8). Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural
   tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the
   behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the
   evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more
   flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective
   advantage(9-11). Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as
   resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour(7)
   (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities
   can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the
   insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction(13)
   often results in polymorphic populations(14) in which some individuals
   put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history
   theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should
   result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour(15).
   Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should
   be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies
   to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently
   differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we
   demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal
   personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural
   types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of
   behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the
   common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like
   boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal
   personalities(2-8).}},

   (plasticity), and that these phenomena can be considered complementary

Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis specifies that closely
   related species or populations experiencing different ecological
   conditions should differ in a suite of metabolic, hormonal and immunity
   traits that have coevolved with the life-history particularities related
   to these conditions. Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS
   concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for
   numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history
   traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the
   POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits
   between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that
   consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality,
   covary with life history and physiological differences at the
   within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss
   how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which personality studies
   can be integrated to address how variation in personality traits is
   maintained within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Personality differences are a widespread phenomenon throughout the
   animal kingdom. Past research has focused on the characterization of
   such differences and a quest for their proximate and ultimate causation.
   However, the consequences of these differences for ecology and evolution
   received much less attention. Here, we strive to fill this gap by
   providing a comprehensive inventory of the potential implications of
   personality differences, ranging from population growth and persistence
   to species interactions and community dynamics, and covering issues such
   as social evolution, the speed of evolution, evolvability, and
   speciation. The emerging picture strongly suggests that personality
   differences matter for ecological and evolutionary processes (and their
   interaction) and, thus, should be considered a key dimension of
   ecologically and evolutionarily relevant intraspecific variation.}},

Abstract = {{A perplexing new question that has emerged from the recent surge of
   interest in behavioural syndromes or animal personalities is - why do
   individual animals behave consistently when behavioural flexibility is
   advantageous? If individuals have a tendency to be generally aggressive,
   then a relatively aggressive individual might be overly aggressive
   towards offspring, mates or even predators. Despite these costs, studies
   in several taxa have shown that individuals that are more aggressive are
   also relatively bold. However, the behavioural correlation is not
   universal; even within a species, population comparisons have shown that
   boldness and aggressiveness are correlated in populations of
   sticklebacks that are under strong predation pressure, but not in low
   predation populations. Here, we provide the first demonstration that an
   environmental factor can induce a correlation between boldness and
   aggressiveness. Boldness under predation risk and aggressiveness towards
   a conspecific were measured before and after sticklebacks were exposed
   to predation by trout, which predated half the sticklebacks. Exposure to
   predation generated the boldness-aggressiveness behavioural correlation.
   The behavioural correlation was produced by both selection by predators
   and behavioural plasticity. These results support the hypothesis that
   certain correlations between behaviours might be adaptive in some
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate
   causation and its ecological and evolutionary significance, but have
   mostly ignored questions about its development, although an
   understanding of the latter is highly relevant to these other questions.
   One possible reason for this neglect is confusion about many of the
   concepts and terms that are necessary to study the development of animal
   personality. Here, we provide a framework for studying personality
   development that focuses on the properties of animal personality, and
   considers how and why these properties may change over time. We
   specifically focus on three dimensions of personality: (1) contextual
   generality at a given age or time, (2) temporal consistency in
   behavioural traits and in relationships between traits, and (3) the
   effects of genes and experience on the development of personality at a
   given age or life stage. We advocate using a new approach, contextual
   reaction norms, to study the contextual generality of personality traits
   at the level of groups, individuals and genotypes, show how concepts and
   terms borrowed from the literature on personality development in humans
   can be used to study temporal changes in personality at the level of
   groups and individuals, and demonstrate how classical developmental
   reaction norms can provide insights into the ways that genes and
   experiential factors interact across ontogeny to affect the expression
   of personality traits. In addition, we discuss how correlations between
   the effects of genes and experience on personality development can arise
   as a function of individuals' control over their own environment, via
   niche-picking or niche-construction. Using this framework, we discuss
   several widely held assumptions about animal personality development
   that still await validation, identify neglected methodological issues,
   and describe a number of promising new avenues for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific trait variation has long served as a conceptual foundation
   for our understanding of ecological patterns and dynamics. In
   particular, ecologists recognise the important role that animal
   behaviour plays in shaping ecological processes. An emerging area of
   interest in animal behaviour, the study of behavioural syndromes (animal
   personalities) considers how limited behavioural plasticity, as well as
   behavioural correlations affects an individuals fitness in diverse
   ecological contexts. In this article we explore how insights from the
   concept and study of behavioural syndromes provide fresh understanding
   of major issues in population ecology. We identify several general
   mechanisms for how population ecology phenomena can be influenced by a
   species or populations average behavioural type, by within-species
   variation in behavioural type, or by behavioural correlations across
   time or across ecological contexts. We note, in particular, the
   importance of behavioural type-dependent dispersal in spatial ecology.
   We then review recent literature and provide new syntheses for how these
   general mechanisms produce novel insights on five major issues in
   population ecology: (1) limits to species distribution and abundance;
   (2) species interactions; (3) population dynamics; (4) relative
   responses to human-induced rapid environmental change; and (5)

Pages = {{641-653}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we show how animal personality could explain some of the
   large inter-individual variation in resting metabolic rate (MR) and
   explore methodological and functional linkages between personality and
   energetics. Personality will introduce variability in resting MR
   measures because individuals consistently differ in their stress
   response, exploration or activity levels, all of which influence MR
   measurements made with respirometry and the doubly-labelled water
   technique. Physiologists try to exclude these behavioural influences
   from resting MR measurements, but animal personality research indicates
   that these attempts are unlikely to be successful. For example, because
   reactive animals ``freeze{''} when submitted to a stress, their MR could
   be classified as ``resting{''} because of immobility when in fact they
   are highly stressed with an elevated MR. More importantly, recent
   research demonstrating that behavioural responses to novel and highly
   artificial stimuli are correlated with both behaviour and fitness under
   more natural circumstances calls into question the wisdom of excluding
   these behavioural influences on MR measurements. The reason that
   intra-specific variation in resting MR are so weakly correlated with
   daily energy expenditure (DEE) and fitness, may be that the latter two
   measures fully incorporate personality while the former partially
   excludes its influence. Because activity, exploration, boldness and
   aggressiveness are energetically costly, personality and metabolism
   should be correlated and physiological constraints may underlie
   behavioural syndromes. We show how physiological ecologists can better
   examine behavioural linkages between personality and metabolism, as
   required to better understand the physiological correlates of
   personality and the evolutionary consequences of metabolic variability.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in proximate and ultimate causes and consequences of
   between- and within-individual variation in labile components of the
   phenotype such as behaviour or physiology characterizes current research
   in evolutionary ecology. The study of individual variation requires
   tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into

   components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We
   provide an overview of how mixed-effect models can be used to partition
   variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into
   between- and within-individual variance components. Optimal sampling
   schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of
   repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and
   within-individual correlations, are detailed. Mixed-effect models enable
   the usage of unambiguous terminology for patterns of biological
   variation that currently lack a formal statistical definition (e.g.
   animal personality or behavioural syndromes), and facilitate
   cross-fertilisation between disciplines such as behavioural ecology,

Abstract = {{Individual variation in behavior and physiology is a widespread and
   ecologically functional phenomenon in nature in virtually all vertebrate
   species. Due to domestication of laboratory animals, studies may suffer
   from a strong selection bias. This paper summarizes behavioral,
   neuroendocrine and neurobiological studies using the natural individual
   variation in rats and mice. Individual behavioral characteristics appear
   to be consistent over time and across situations. The individual
   variation has at least two dimensions in which the quality of the
   response to a challenging condition (coping style) is independent from
   the quantity of that response (stress reactivity). The neurobiology
   reveals important differences in the homeostatic control of the
   serotonergic neuron and the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in
   relation to coping style. It is argued that a careful exploitation of
   the broad natural and biologically functional individual variation in
   behavior and physiology may help in developing better animal models for
   understanding individual disease vulnerability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Recent progress has been made on the study of personality in animals,
   both from a mechanistic and a functional perspective. While we start
   knowing more about the proximal mechanisms responsible for the
   consistent differences in behaviour between individuals in a population,
   little is known yet about the relationship between the phenotypic
   distribution of personality traits, or combinations of traits, and
   fitness. Here we provide an overview of the available literature on the
   fitness consequences of personality traits in natural populations. We
   start by a description of two case studies that have examined the role
   of natural selection on personality traits in the wild (i.e., the great
   tit. Parus major and bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis), and review other
   studies that have reported some links between personality traits and
   fitness indices, in a large variety of animal species. We continue by
   outlining both direct approaches (i.e., measuring correlational
   selection on personality trait combinations) and indirect approaches
   (i.e., comparing correlations between personality traits within and
   between populations) to study suites of correlated traits from an
   adaptive perspective. This review, we hope, will be able to stimulate
   the use of the phenotypic selection analysis applied to the study of
   selection on personality traits in animals.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences (CIDs) in behavior are a widespread
   phenomenon in animals, but the proximate reasons for them are
   unresolved. We discuss evidence for the hypothesis that CIDs in energy
   metabolism, as reflected by resting metabolic rate (RMR), promote CIDs
   in behavior patterns that either provide net energy (e.g. foraging
   activity), and/or consume energy (e.g. courtship activity). In doing so,
   we provide a framework for linking together RMR, behavior, and
   life-history productivity. Empirical studies suggest that RMR is (a)
   related to the capacity to generate energy, (b) repeatable, and (c)
   correlated with behavioral output (e.g. aggressiveness) and productivity
   (e.g. growth). We conclude by discussing future research directions to
   clarify linkages between behavior and energy metabolism in this emerging

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1117-1129}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be
   considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to
   how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape
   structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the
   spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity
   or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes
   with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that
   has often been ignored in landscape ecology. Our working hypothesis is
   that the functional grain of resource patches in the landscape is a
   crucial factor shaping individual movements, and therefore influencing
   landscape connectivity. Such changes are likely to occur on the
   short-term (some generations). We review empirical studies comparing
   dispersal behavior in landscapes differing in their fragmentation level,
   i.e., with variable resource grain. We show that behavioral variation
   affecting each of the three stages of the dispersal process (emigration,
   displacement or transfer in the matrix, and immigration) is indeed
   likely to occur according to selective pressures resulting from changes
   in the grain of the landscape (mortality or deferred costs).
   Accordingly, landscape connectivity results from the interaction between
   the dispersal behavior of individuals and the grain of each particular
   landscape. The existence of this interaction requires that connectivity
   estimates (being based on individual-based models, least cost distance
   algorithms, and structural connectivity metrics or even Euclidian
   distance) should be carefully evaluated for their applicability with
   respect to the required level of precision in species-specific and
   landscape information.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we review recent models that provide adaptive explanations
   for animal personalities: individual differences in behaviour (or suites
   of correlated behaviours) that are consistent over time or contexts. We
   start by briefly discussing patterns of variation in behaviour that have
   been documented in natural populations. In the main part of the paper we
   discuss models for personality differences that (i) explain animal
   personalities as adaptive behavioural responses to differences in state,
   (ii) investigate how feedbacks between state and behaviour can stabilize
   initial differences among individuals and (iii) provide adaptive
   explanations for animal personalities that are not based on state
   differences. Throughout, we focus on two basic questions. First, what is
   the basic conceptual idea underlying the model? Second, what are the key
   assumptions and predictions of the model? We conclude by discussing
   empirical features of personalities that have not yet been addressed by
   formal modelling. While this paper is primarily intended to guide
   empiricists through current adaptive theory, thereby stimulating
   empirical tests of these models, we hope it also inspires theoreticians
   to address aspects of personalities that have received little attention
   up to now.}},

Abstract = {{A coping style (also termed behavioural syndrome or personality) is
   defined as a correlated set of individual behavioural and physiological
   characteristics that is consistent over time and across situations. This
   relatively stable trait is a fundamental and adaptively significant
   phenomenon in the biology of a broad range of species, i.e. it confers
   differential fitness consequences under divergent environmental
   conditions. Behavioural flexibility appears to be an important
   underlying attribute or feature of the coping style that might explain
   consistency across situations. Proactive coping is characterized by low
   flexibility expressed as rather rigid, routine-like behavioural
   tendencies and reduced impulse control (behavioural inhibition) in
   operant conditioning paradigms. This article summarizes some of the
   evidence that individual differentiation in behavioural flexibility
   emerges as a function of underlying variability in the activation of a
   brain circuitry that includes the prefrontal cortex and its key
   neurochemical signalling pathways (e.g. dopaminergic and serotonergic
   input). We argue that the multidimensional nature of animal personality
   and the terminology used for the various dimensions should reflect the
   differential pattern of activation of the underlying neuronal network
   and the behavioural control function of its components. Accordingly,
   unravelling the molecular mechanisms that give rise to individual
   differences in the coping style will be an important topic in
   biobehavioural neurosciences, ecology and evolutionary biology.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a conceptual framework for the understanding of animal
   personalities in terms of adaptive evolution. We focus on two basic
   questions. First, why do behavioural types exhibit limited behavioural
   plasticity, that is, behavioural correlations both across contexts and
   over time? Second, how can multiple behavioural types coexist within a
   single population? We emphasize differences in `state' among individuals
   in combination with state-dependent behaviour. Some states are
   inherently stable and individual differences in such states can explain
   stable differences in suites of behaviour if it is adaptive to make
   behaviour in various contexts dependent on such states. Behavioural
   stability and cross-context correlations in behaviour are more difficult
   to explain if individual states are potentially more variable. In such
   cases stable personalities can result from state-dependent behaviour if
   state and behaviour mutually reinforce each other by feedback
   mechanisms. We discuss various evolutionary mechanisms for the
   maintenance of variation (in states and/or behaviour), including
   frequency-dependent selection, spatial variation with incomplete
   matching between habitat and phenotype, bet-hedging in a temporally
   fluctuating environment, and non-equilibrium dynamics. Although state
   differences are important, we also discuss how social conventions and
   social signalling can give rise to adaptive personality differences in
   the absence of state differences.}},

Abstract = {{This review examines the contribution of research on fishes to the
   growing field of behavioural syndromes. Current knowledge of behavioural
   syndromes in fishes is reviewed with respect to five main axes of animal
   personality: (1) shyness-boldness, (2) exploration-avoidance, (3)
   activity, (4) aggressiveness and (5) sociability. Compared with other
   taxa, research on fishes has played a leading role in describing the
   shy-bold personality axis and has made innovative contributions to the
   study of the sociability dimension by incorporating social network
   theory. Fishes are virtually the only major taxon in which behavioural
   correlations have been compared between populations. This research has
   guided the field in examining how variation in selection regime may
   shape personality. Recent research on fishes has also made important
   strides in understanding genetic and neuroendocrine bases for
   behavioural syndromes using approaches involving artificial selection,
   genetic mapping, candidate gene and functional genomics. This work has
   illustrated consistent individual variation in highly complex
   neuroendocrine and gene expression pathways. In contrast, relatively
   little work on fishes has examined the ontogenetic stability of
   behavioural syndromes or their fitness consequences. Finally, adopting a
   behavioural syndrome framework in fisheries management issues including
   artificial propagation, habitat restoration and invasive species, may
   promote restoration success. Few studies, however, have examined the
   ecological relevance of behavioural syndromes in the field. Knowledge of
   how behavioural syndromes play out in the wild will be crucial to
   incorporating such a framework into management practices.}},

   genetics is increasing. Studies on consistent individual differences in
   behavioural traits provide a good opportunity to do controlled
   experiments on the genetic mechanisms underlying the variation and
   covariation in complex behavioural traits. In this review we will
   highlight the contribution of genetic studies in animal personality
   research. We will start with reviewing the evidence that shows how much
   variation in animal personality traits is genetic, and connect this to
   knowledge from human personality studies. We will continue by
   considering the nature of that variation, its generation and
   maintenance. Finally we will point to further possibilities for studying
   the genetics of animal personalities. We will underline the importance
   of integrating both proximate and ultimate approaches when studying the
   evolution of animal personalities.}},

Abstract = {{With the exception of a few model species, individual differences in
   cognition remain relatively unstudied in non-human animals. One
   intriguing possibility is that variation in cognition is functionally
   related to variation in personality. Here, we review some examples and
   present hypotheses on relationships between personality (or behavioural
   syndromes) and individual differences in cognitive style. Our hypotheses
   are based largely on a connection between fast-slow behavioural types
   (BTs; e.g. boldness, aggressiveness, exploration tendency) and cognitive
   speed-accuracy trade-offs. We also discuss connections between BTs,
   cognition and ecologically important aspects of decision-making,
   including sampling, impulsivity, risk sensitivity and choosiness.
   Finally, we introduce the notion of cognition syndromes, and apply ideas
   from theories on adaptive behavioural syndromes to generate predictions
   on cognition syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) has been subjected to a huge range
   of selection pressures during domestication that has resulted in a
   considerable diversity in morphology and behaviour. This, together with
   the many uses the dog is put to in our society, makes the dog an
   interesting model for studies of animal personality. However, only a few
   attempts have been done to study individual differences in dogs. In this
   study, behavioural data from 15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds were
   used to investigate the existence of personality traits in dogs. The
   data were collected at a personality test that tested the dogs'
   reactions to strangers, ``fleeing{''} prey-like objects, and several
   potential fear- and aggression-eliciting stimuli. Factor analyses
   revealed the existence of five narrow traits: ``Playfulness{''},
   ``Curiosity/Fearlessness{''}, ``Chase-proneness{''}, ``Sociability{''}
   and ``Aggressiveness{''}. Higher-order factor analyses showed that all
   factors except ``Aggressiveness{''} were related to each other, creating
   a broad factor that influences behaviour in a range of situations. Both
   narrow and broad factors were found in a dataset including data from a
   large number of breeds, as well as within eight of Federation
   Cynologique Internationale's (FCI's) 10 breed groups. This indicates
   that the personality dimensions found in the study are general for the
   dog as a species. The finding of a major behavioural dimension in
   different groups of dog breeds, together with comparable results
   previously found for wolves (Canis lupus), suggests that the dimension
   is evolutionarily stable and has survived the varied selection pressures
   encountered during domestication. The broad factor is comparable to the
   shyness-boldness axis previously found in both humans and animals, and
   to human ``supertraits{''} (a combination of Extraversion and
   Neuroticism). The results of this study can be used to describe and
   compare individual dogs, as well as breeds. This, in turn, can be used
   in applications like selection of service dogs and breeding animals, as
   well as predicting behaviour problems in pet dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The existence of `animal personality', i.e. consistent individual
   differences in behaviour across time and contexts, is an evolutionary
   puzzle that has recently generated considerable research interest.
   Although social factors are generally considered to be important, it is
   as yet unclear how they might select for personality. Drawing from
   ecological niche theory, we explore how social conflict and alternative
   social options can be key factors in the evolution and development of
   consistent individual differences in behaviour. We discuss how animal
   personality research might benefit from insights into the study of
   alternative tactics and illustrate how selection can favour behavioural
   diversification and consistency due to fitness benefits resulting from
   conflict reduction among social partners.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that an individual may be constrained, and even behave
   sub-optimally, because of its personality type has fundamental
   implications for understanding individual- to group-level processes.
   Despite recent interest in the study of animal personalities within
   behavioural ecology, the field is fraught with conceptual and
   methodological difficulties inherent in any young discipline. We review
   the current agreement of definitions and methods used in personality
   studies across taxa and systems, and find that current methods risk
   misclassifying traits. Fortunately, these problems have been faced
   before by other similar fields during their infancy, affording important
   opportunities to learn from past mistakes. We review the tools that were
   developed to overcome similar methodological problems in psychology.
   These tools emphasise the importance of attempting to measure animal
   personality traits using multiple tests and the care that needs to be
   taken when interpreting correlations between personality traits or their
   tests. Accordingly, we suggest an integrative theoretical framework that
   incorporates these tools to facilitate a robust and unified approach in
   the study of animal personality.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personalities are common across taxa and have important
   evolutionary and ecological implications. Such consistent individual
   differences correlate with important life-history traits such as
   dispersal. Indeed, some environmental conditions are supposed to
   determine dispersers with a specific personality. For example, an
   increased density should promote the departure of individuals with less
   social tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that dispersers from
   high-density populations should primarily be asocial individuals,
   whereas dispersers from low-density populations should be social
   individuals. In the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara), we measured
   attraction towards the odour of conspecifics on juveniles at birth as a
   metric of social tolerance. We then released these juveniles into
   populations of different densities and measured dispersal and settlement
   behaviours with regard to social tolerance. One year later, we again
   measured the social tolerance of surviving individuals. The social
   tolerance is constant across time and strongly reflects the individual's
   dispersal and settlement patterns with respect to population density.
   These results strongly suggest that social personalities exist and
   influence dispersal decisions. Further studies will help to elucidate
   the proximate and ultimate determinants of social personalities.}},
