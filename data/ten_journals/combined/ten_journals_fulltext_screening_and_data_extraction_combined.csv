Free and Carlson, Bradley E.","10.1007/s00265-017-2428-8","Behavioral ecologists have assumed that animals will optimize behavior to match their current situation, yet studies reveal limited behavioral flexibility and extensive variation among individuals in their response to a similar stimulus. This phenomenon is referred to as ``animal personality,{''} and recent efforts seek to determine the implications of personality for interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. Doing so promises to illuminate how selection is operating on behavioral traits and, consequently, how stable, among-individual variation in behavioral types is maintained evolutionarily. We examined a natural population of forest-dwelling eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) to understand the effects of differences in levels of boldness on thermoregulatory behavior, injury history, and movement rates. Repeated behavioral trials revealed that individual turtles varied consistently and dramatically in boldness (latency to emerge from the shell or begin moving after handling and confinement). Behavioral differences were independent of phenotypic state or environmental conditions, suggesting the existence of personality in these turtles.

Doing so promises to illuminate how selection is operating on behavioral traits and, consequently, how stable, among-individual variation in behavioral types is maintained evolutionarily. We examined a natural population of forest-dwelling eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) to understand the effects of differences in levels of boldness on thermoregulatory behavior, injury history, and movement rates.

We found that fish reared with predator experience, but without the presence of older group members outperformed fish with other rearing backgrounds in reversal learning and that individuals, which had been reared in a socially more complex environment together with older group members responded less neophobic toward a novel object than individuals reared among siblings only. Comparative evidence from fish and rats suggests that these developmental effects may be driven by the cues of safety perceived in the presence of guarding parents.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,2

Here, we investigated the relationship between three personality traits hypothesized to be linked to the proactive-reactive axis (i.e. exploration, activity and object neophilia) and dominance in wild groups of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a resident passerine bird that overwinters in flocks characterized by linear dominance hierarchies. We predicted that if dominance is linked to personality within these social groups, dominant individuals should be more exploratory, active and neophilic than subordinates. Dominance relationships in our groups of black-capped chickadees were highly transitive and asymmetric, which is typical of linear hierarchies. However, none of the personality traits were significantly correlated with dominance, and there was no evidence that they correlated as part of a syndrome. These results suggest that proactive-reactive personality traits do not contribute to the establishment of black-capped chickadee hierarchies in the wild. We discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual attributes are not sufficient to explain the linearity of many dominance hierarchies found in nature.

The absence of such a trade-off might offer a functional explanation for why, in stickleback fish and many other species, bolder individuals tend to initiate movement and shyer individuals to follow-bold leaders may result in faster group decisions without compromising accuracy.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,2

In passerines, aggression during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care. This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice, they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality. We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further investigation.Significance statementMale songbirds, when attracting mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate.

However, little is known about to what extent this variability responds to different and consistent behaviours between individuals. The aim of this study was to analyse the individual variation and consistency in behaviour of scatter-hoarding rodents within a population. As our model we used the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a key disperser of holm oak acorns, Quercus ilex, which, in turn, suffers high predation pressure by the common genet, Genetta genetta. In two sets of laboratory experiments, we compared the variance and consistency in behaviours and acorn management due to individual differences with that due to manipulation, using genet scents, of the perceived predation risk. Genet scents reduced the activity (i.e. time out of the refuge) in all wood mice, but the differences and consistency in activity between individuals accounted for most of the variance. Also, mice showed different and consistent stress or relaxed behaviours. Most of the variance in seed management variables, such as dispersal distance and seed size selection, was explained by consistent differences between individuals across scent treatments. The increase in stress behaviours and decrease in relaxed behaviours were positively related to dispersal ability (i.e. longer distances and larger acorns). Our study highlights the importance of considering the individual component of behaviour in scatter-hoarding rodents.

Here, we propose that behavioural syndromes may also constitute such a link. We illustrate this mechanism in the butter hamlet, Hypoplectrus unicolor, a reef fish from the wider Caribbean, with aggressive mimicry as the focal ecological trait. Aggressive mimicry is of particular interest in hamlets since it has been proposed to play a key role in the radiation of Hypoplectrus. Individuals from a natural population in Bocas del Toro, Panama, were tagged and their diurnal and spawning behaviours observed over 2 years. The results indicate that aggressive mimicry behaviour differed consistently between individuals and formed two discrete behavioural types that also differed with respect to territoriality. Differences in territoriality between the two behavioural types translated into different use of space in spawning contexts, which generated a tendency for assortative mating by behavioural type. This case study illustrates how behavioural syndromes may form a link between ecologically relevant behavioural traits and mate choice, suggesting that they might play an underappreciated role in the early stages of speciation.

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild, free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest. Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few visits on each feeding trip.

These changes may relate to temperature regulation, torpor use, basal metabolic rate, body mass or behaviour, all acting in concert to ensure the best adjustment to the environmental challenges. As winter approaches, many small mammals develop a winter phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from a summer one. However, there is a significant within-population polymorphism in winter phenotype. We hypothesized that winter phenotype is correlated with consistent between-individual differences in animal behaviour, i.e. animal personality, and energy metabolism. We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) and behavioural traits in three winter phenotypes of Siberian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, which were acclimated to summer-like and then to winter-like conditions: fully responding, nonresponding and partially responding to a short photoperiod. We found no differences in behavioural traits between hamsters of different winter phenotypes, but the seasonal increase in activity was lowest in full responders indicating their lower behavioural flexibility than partial responders and nonresponders. The same was true for BMR. While nonresponders and partial responders increased their BMR from summer to winter, full responders did not change it. We argue that different winter phenotypes are maintained in the population because they could be beneficial under different environmental conditions. We also suggest that within a population there is a continuum of winter phenotypes, which is not related to differences in animal personalities.

However, survival selection on a major personality trait, antipredator behavior, and its sex-dependency, has been seldom measured in the wild. Here, we found that yearling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) showed consistency in agitation upon repeated exposure to a restraint-handling protocol, probably reflecting antipredator behavior, and that males were more agitated than females. Females that exhibited larger antipredator behavior were more likely to survive until the next breeding season with no variation among 3 study years nor across 7 breeding colonies, suggesting that variation in antipredator behavior is not maintained by spatiotemporal variation in viability selection on antipredator behavior. In both sexes, the intensity of melanin-based ventral plumage coloration positively covaried with antipredator behavior, consistent with previous observations from diverse vertebrate species. In some barn swallow populations, male coloration is targeted by directional intersexual selection, suggesting that melanization signals antipredator behavior to prospecting females and that sexual selection for antipredator behavior, or other correlated personality traits, can drive the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in barn swallows. Thus, we showed that viability selection occurs on antipredator behavior and that spatiotemporal variation in selection has no major role in promoting variation in antipredator behavior.

Nevertheless, research on individual variation in animal cognition is still limited. Further, although individual cognitive abilities have been suggested to be linked to personality (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among individuals), few studies have linked performance across multiple cognitive tasks to personality traits. Thus, the interplays between cognition and personality are still unclear. We therefore investigated the relationships between an important aspect of cognition, learning, and personality, by exposing young and adult red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) to multiple learning tasks (discriminative, reversal, and spatial learning) and personality assays (novel arena, novel object, and tonic immobility). Learning speed was not correlated across learning tasks, and learning speed in discrimination and spatial learning tasks did not co-vary with personality. However, learning speed in reversal tasks was associated with individual variation in exploration, and in an age-dependent manner. More explorative chicks learned the reversal task faster than less explorative ones, while the opposite association was found for adult females (learning speed could not be assayed in adult males). In the same reversal tasks, we also observed a sex difference in learning speed of chicks, with females learning faster than males. Our results suggest that the relationship between cognition and personality is complex, as shown by its task- and age-dependence, and encourage further investigation of the causality and dynamics of this relationship.Significance statementIn the ancestor of today's chickens, the red junglefowl, we explored how personality and cognition relate by exposing both chicks and adults to several learning tasks and personality assays.

Exploration correlated with learning speed in the more complex task of reversal learning: faster exploring chicks, but slower exploring adult females, learned faster, compared to less explorative birds.

In this study, we evaluated two major parameters contributing to the fitness of the species: reproduction and offspring survival. We selected two different phenotypes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) selected by their colouration patterns: phenotype 1) named Wild type, UAB line (WT-UAB) with a homogeneous colouration pattern (clear and defined lateral stripes) and phenotype 2) Wild type indefinite (WT-I) had a heterogeneous colouration pattern and different degrees of lateral stripe definition. All animals were also screened for personality. We then compared their reproductive success (spawning rate) and offspring survival at different stages, from egg to larvae, and for 2 successive generations (parental generation was G0; First and second generations were G1 and G2 respectively). Our results show that personality traits were the main source of variability between the fitness components measured: both personalities had similar total numbers of eggs spawned but proactive animals, for both colour phenotypes, had higher reproductive success. This was reflected in a higher percentage of spawning viability at 1day post fertilization (dpf), higher total survival and growth rates at larval stages. Proactive phenotypes from WT-UAB population had a higher overall fitness in comparison to the other phenotypes studied. Our findings imply that fitness of this species when kept under similar husbandry conditions is significantly influenced by parental personality and not by their external appearance.

Horses kept in stables often display a range of abnormal behaviours related to lack of control over their environment, which can lead to behavioural and health problems. An individual's personality also plays an important role in its susceptibility and resilience to the development of diseases and abnormal behaviour; thus, an evaluation of horses' personalities could be crucial to selecting individuals best able to cope with different work activities. This study aimed to assess the well-being of police horses maintained in a semi-confinement regime in Brazil by associating their personalities to the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and disease. Using a non-invasive approach, different tests were performed to investigate the horses' behaviour, personality and welfare. A frustration test and a novel object test were conducted with 46 horses and the individuals' personalities were assessed using questionnaires and behaviour tests. In addition, we evaluated their physical health through a survey of their veterinary records. The data for horses were evaluated individually. The results demonstrated the occurrence of multiple abnormal behaviours motivated by factors such as diet and lack of social contact. Moreover, the personality tests indicated this is an important component when evaluating welfare, since correlations were found between personality traits and abnormal behaviour expression, and between personality traits and health problems.

The asset protection principle predicts that an animal's risk-taking behaviour should vary as a result of its residual reproductive value (RRV); animals with greater RRV would incur a greater cost if injured or killed and should therefore take fewer risks than those with low RRV. Despite the intuitive appeal of this hypothesis, few studies have effectively separated the effects of RRV on behaviour from those of age. We addressed this weakness in the widely invoked hypothesis by measuring the risk-taking behaviour of female Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, at various points in the animal's lifetime. We found significant effects of age on risk-taking behaviour: older females emerged from a shelter sooner after a simulated predation threat and exhibited greater mobility in an open arena. Importantly, there was also a significant marginal effect of RRV on risk-taking behaviour. Females with lower RRV displayed greater levels of risk taking than females with high RRV. Our results thereby offer support for the asset protection principle as an explanation for state-dependent variation in risk-taking behaviour.

Previous studies have found that personality traits measured through standardized behavioural tests predict trappability (i.e. `trap happy' versus `trap shy'). However, the nature of this relationship is unclear since it has been explored only within single species and never across environments. This is problematic because trappability is a labile characteristic that can vary between seasons, environments and years. It is essential to understand this link because there is great potential for the use of trappability as a proxy for personality. For example, if trappability reflects personality, this would allow researchers to extract personality data from long-term capture-mark-recapture data sets. To clarify this relationship, we designed a large-scale field experiment to measure personality and trappability in five small mammal species and across four distinct forest types. With an open field test, we quantified behaviour in 189 deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, 170 southern red-backed voles, Myodes gapperi, 42 American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, 58 woodland jumping mice, Napaeozapus insignis, and 87 northern short-tailed shrews, Blarina brevicauda. We identified personality in all five of our target species, and through mixed-effects modelling we found that personality traits did not predict different aspects of trappability. Furthermore, trappability was not a repeatable measure (i.e. animals that were trap happy in one session were not necessarily trap happy throughout the trapping season).

Removal of individuals with particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk, and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status, with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance. Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.

Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls, produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the relevance of more vocal individuals for the group.

Consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour (individual behavioural types, BTs) of predator and prey (or both) may fundamentally shape their mutual interactions. Several recent studies have shown that it is important to consider the interaction of BTs on both sides of predator-prey interactions. Otherwise, there is a high risk of erroneous inference about the outcome of predation. Until now, however, no study has investigated how BT vs BT interaction affects the predation of mesopredators by top predators, especially when the mesopredator is a low-ranked prey for the top predator. Such knowledge is extremely important if we want to predict the effect of individual BTs on food web dynamics. We have investigated in our laboratory experiments how foraging aggressiveness of the top predator (spider, Philodromus cespitum, Philodromidae) and risk-aversion as a form of shyness of the mesopredator (spider, Philodromus albidus, Philodromidae) determine the probability of predation. The highest explanatory power had the model with additive effects of mesopredator's risk-aversion and top predator's foraging aggressiveness. Other models, including those with BT vs BT interaction, had poor explanatory power. It was probably due to the fact that timid top predators are often choosy and do not catch low-ranked prey, while aggressive top predators are opportunists. The risk-averse mesopredators are also more cautious than risk-prone mesopredators regarding their surroundings and can defend themselves faster. Our results therefore fit with the classical hypothesis about trade-off between foraging and safety. Behavioural types of predator and prey jointly determine the mortality of prey. In our laboratory experiments, we investigated how foraging aggressiveness of a top predator spider and the risk-aversion of a mesopredator spider (potential prey) determine the probability of predation. We demonstrated that top predator's foraging aggressiveness and mesopredator's risk-aversion determine the probability of mesopredator's mortality only additively. The mesopredator's probability of being killed decreased with its risk-aversion and increased with top predator's foraging aggressiveness. The effect was additive instead of interactive because the mesopredator represents a dangerous prey for the top predator. The timid top predators are also choosy and do not attack dangerous prey, while the aggressive/non-choosy top predators are opportunistic. Further, the risk-averse mesopredators are more cautious regarding their surroundings and can react faster to the presence of a top predator, compared to risk-prone and slowly reacting mesopredators.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes","both","We measured BT of each individual twice to explore whether the inter-individual differences are consistent in time and therefore repeatable.

This may have been caused by several things. Firstly, we shortened the repeatability testing period from 1 week to 1 day. It is well known that shortening time between measurements increases repeatability (Bell et al. 2009). Secondly, we fed the mesopredator ad libitum between the measurements in the previous study. The ad libitum feeding probably enabled switch between energy states and flexible change in the behaviour of the mesopredator. In the current study, we maintained the states of individual mesopredators because we did not feed the spiders between the measurements. The individual mesopredators, therefore, seem to adaptively adjust their behaviour to fit their actual condition, i.e. risk-averse/timid when their energy states are high, while risk-prone/aggressive when their energy states are low.

The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis suggests that differences in personalities result from divergent life-history strategies, with more active/risk-taking individuals reproducing rapidly but dying young. However, studies of wild animals provide only limited support for key elements of this and related hypotheses, such as a negative relationship between residual reproductive value and activity. Furthermore, alternative models make divergent predictions regarding the relationship between risk-taking behaviours and variables consistent in the short-term, such as condition. To test these predictions, we regularly measured willingness to leave a shelter and the activity level of wild adult field crickets (Gryllus campestris) at both short and long intervals over their entire adult lives. We found some support for a pace-of-life syndrome influencing personality, as lifespan was negatively related to willingness to leave the shelter and activity.

While this role of behaviour in defence is well studied, very little is known about how other traits, specifically the structure of architectural constructions such as webs and nests, contribute to offspring defence. Additionally, although some taxa show consistent individual differences in offspring defence behaviour, it is completely unknown whether individuals also differ in defensive structures. We addressed these questions in the redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, by measuring how a female laying an eggcase influences female behaviour and web structure, and whether those traits scale with relative reproductive investment. Our results show that females modified web structure in response to an eggcase, but only the protective elements of web structure positively scaled with the relative value of that eggcase. Finally, despite the significant correlations, fixed effects (e.g. eggcase possession/value) in the models explained only 5-23\% of the variation in behaviour and web structure, while the random effect of individual identity explained 46-65\% of the variation. This variation drove moderate to high repeatability estimates across all traits, suggesting that some individuals consistently invest relatively more in defence, while some invest less. These results highlight that extended phenotypic traits may be a critical component of offspring defence in some taxa.

We tested specific predictions of this hypothesis, measuring individual differences in associative learning speed and flexibility, quantified via reversal learning, of 86 bank voles, Myodes glareolus, along with their activity and boldness. We found that bolder and more active individuals were fast, inflexible and persistent in the associative learning tasks, whereas shyer and less active individuals were slow and flexible. We also found evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off: correct choices in the cognitive tasks required more time for all individuals compared to incorrect choices, but bolder, more active voles always made their decisions faster than reactive ones. The difference between the time required for a correct and an incorrect choice was most pronounced in initial learning for shyer and less active individuals, but for bolder, more active individuals it was most pronounced in the reversal learning task.

Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity.

Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus, regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific, but instead persists through time and across multiple social interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles, including how socially active they are and with whom they interact.

However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in penguins' nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (bold, mobile) or risk-averse (shy, non-mobile). We then assessed their breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4weeks in 2015 and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly influence birds' breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent, risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be reduced in African penguins.","yes",NA,NA,NA,"yes","within","To assess the stability of the different behaviours constituting boldness and mobility in nest defence over time ","yes","Consistency trials conducted in 2015 for 20 individuals revealed a high individual repeatability (R) in boldness degree and mobility index. // repeatability indices (R, R = 1 highly consistent, R = 0 non-consistent) of boldness","no",NA,NA,"no",NA,"MM","no",1

The snail C. funebralis shows consistent individual variation in predator response where some fearful snails actively flee bodies of water occupied by predators whereas bolder snails consistently do not. We show here that bold snails are significantly more likely to survive encounters with a predatory sea star and, somewhat counterintuitively, fearful snails actually suffer higher mortality rates.

Offering variety in feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals' exploration of different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested the degree to which Holstein heifers (n = 10) preferred variety in feed vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by measuring switching between feed bins. Individual consistency in preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20\% of their time at varied feed bins), but this preference varied among individuals (from 0 to 46\% of time eating in the forage trial, and 0-93\% in the flavour trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake of novel feed as calves (r(s) = 0.72, n = 9). Preference for varied flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel object (r(s) = -0.65). It thus appears that preference for variety and exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits. These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,1

In garter snakes from ecotypes which are known to differ in ecology, life -history strategy, and physiology, we tested for differences in tongue -flick rate as a measure of information gathering and movement patterns as a measure of general activity. Tongue flicks and movement were strongly positively correlated and both behaviours were repeatable across trials. Snakes from the fast-living ecotype were more active and showed evidence of habituation. The slow-living ecotype maintained low levels of activity throughout the trials. We propose that environmental factors, such as high predation, experienced by the fast-living ecotype select for both increased information-gathering and activity levels to facilitate efficient responses to repeated challenges.

Behavioral syndromes are the result of correlations between behaviors. While repeatability in behavior is not a requirement for behavioral syndromes, the two concepts studied together provide a more comprehensive understanding of how behavior can change over ontogeny. The roles of ontogenetic processes in the emergence of personality and behavioral syndromes have received much individual attention. However, the characterization of both individual trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across both sexes, as in our study, has been relatively rare. Ontogeny refers to changes that occur from conception to maturation, and juveniles might be expected to undergo different selection pressures than sexually mature individuals and also will experience profound changes in hormones, morphology, and environment during this period. In this study, we test for behavioral trait consistency and behavioral syndromes across six time points during ontogenetic development in the desert funnel-web spider (Agelenopsis lisa). Our results indicate behavioral traits generally lack consistency (repeatability) within life stages and across ontogeny. However, penultimate males and mature females do exhibit noticeable mean-level changes, with greater aggressive responses toward prey, shorter latencies to explore their environment and in the exhibition of risk-averse responses to predatory cues. These traits also show high repeatability. Some trait correlations do exist as well. In particular, a strong correlation between aggressiveness toward prey and exploration factors is observed in mature males. However, because correlations among these factors are unstable across ontogeny and vary in strength over time, we conclude that behavioral syndromes do not exist in this species. Nevertheless, our results indicate that increased consistency, increasing average trait values, and varying correlations between traits may coincide with developmentally important changes associated with sexual maturation, albeit at different time points in males and females.

However, capture, marking and manipulation can dramatically alter the animals' behaviour after capture, and thus affect subsequent recapture success. Here, we used a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population as an example to illustrate the sampling bias resulting from the repeated capture of free-ranging individuals. By using repeated measures of the same individuals obtained during our long-term survey, we specifically evaluated the interannual response of breeding adults to capture-related stress, measured as latency to enter nestboxes equipped with a swing-trap. Moreover, we examined changes in the mean and variance of bird age with varying trapping effort using subsamples of the data set. Birds without any previous trapping experience entered nests more quickly than experienced ones, after controlling for other factors affecting latency, such as the sex, offspring quality and the order of capture relative to the other pair member. Birds' reluctance to enter the nest furthermore increased as the number of captures in previous years accumulated, implying that individual pied flycatchers became progressively more difficult to capture over the course of the study. Our results indicate that repeated exposure to capture stress over an animal's lifetime may induce long-lasting behavioural modifications that may influence trappability of the older segments of the population. We also provide evidence that this may ultimately lead to sampling bias towards younger ages, especially when effort is limited. We conclude that systematic age bias due to trapping experience can have important implications for the estimation of variation in a range of traits and should therefore be carefully checked in longitudinal studies.

Then, in a separate context we measured each female's `sociability': their proclivity to affiliate with other guppies. In the mate-choice copying procedure, `focal' females chose to spend time near two putative mates. Next, focals observed another (model) female interact with the focal's non-preferred male. Finally, the focal again chose between the same two males. For sociability, we examined the time focal females spent near a trio of other guppies.

We examined the persistence of behavioral syndromes at multiple levels in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus along a climatic gradient in north-eastern USA. ``Across populations{''}, we predicted that proactive phenotypes, which show higher activity, aggression and exploration, are more likely to persist in warmer climates. ``Within populations{''}, we expected positive associations among proactive behaviors to be more pronounced at warmer sites. Additionally, we measured colony productivity to test whether deviation from the population-level syndrome influences their success, and whether such deviations could vary among populations. Behavioral syndromes clearly occurred across populations, with colonies from warmer environments exhibiting more exploration and foraging but slightly less aggressiveness than colonies from colder sites. However, the presence of behavioral syndromes within sites was population-specific. Positive associations between foraging, exploration and aggression, albeit rarely found, were more pronounced at the warmest sites, whereas negative associations were more common at colder sites. Furthermore, colonies from colder environments showed higher syndrome deviations than colonies from warmer environments, which may be linked to resource limitation and may also negatively affect colony productivity.

Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level.

Body size explained 40\% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment.

Innate personality traits are supposedly less evident in animals when confounded by learning acquired with experience through time. Learning might play a key role in the development and adoption of successful anti-predator strategies, and the related adaptation has the potential to make animals that are more experienced less vulnerable to predation. We carried out a study in a system involving a large herbivorous mammal, female elk, Cervus elaphus, and their primary predator, i. e., human hunters. Using fine-scale satellite telemetry relocations, we tested whether differences in behaviour depending on age were due solely to selection pressure imposed by human hunters, meaning that females that were more cautious were more likely to survive and become older. Or whether learning also was involved, meaning that females adjusted their behaviour as they aged. Our results indicated that both human selection and learning contributed to the adoption of more cautious behavioural strategies in older females. Whereas human selection of behavioural traits has been shown in our previous research, we here provide evidence of additive learning processes being responsible for shaping the behaviour of individuals in this population. Female elk are indeed almost invulnerable to human hunters when older than 9 +/- 10 y. o., confirming that experience contributes to their survival. Female elk monitored in our study showed individually changing behaviours and clear adaptation as they aged, such as reduced movement rates (decreased likelihood of encountering human hunters), and increased use of secure areas (forest and steeper terrain), especially when close to roads. We also found that elk adjusted behaviours depending on the type of threat (bow and arrow vs. rifle hunters). This fine-tuning by elk to avoid hunters, rather than just becoming more cautious during the hunting season, highlights the behavioural plasticity of this species.

One crucial variable is the presence/absence of conspecifics. For animals usually reared in groups, social isolation after birth or hatching can be a highly stressful circumstance, with potentially long-lasting consequences. Here, we assessed the effects of social deprivation (isolation) early in life, that is, absence of conspecifics, versus social enrichment, that is, presence of conspecifics, on developmental time, body size at maturity, mating behaviour and groupliving in the plant-inhabiting predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Socially deprived protonymphs developed more slowly and were less socially competent in grouping behaviour than socially enriched protonymphs. Compromised social competence in grouping behaviour was evident in decreased activity, fewer mutual encounters and larger interindividual distances, all of which may entail severe fitness costs. In female choice/male competition, socially deprived males mated earlier than socially enriched males; in male choice/female competition, socially deprived females were more likely to mate than socially enriched females. In neither mate choice situation did mating duration or body size at maturity differ between socially deprived and enriched mating opponents. Social isolation-induced shifts in mating behaviour may be interpreted as increased attractiveness or competitiveness or, more likely, as hastiness and reduced ability to assess mate quality. Overall, many of the social isolation-induced behavioural changes in P. persimilis are analogous to those observed in other animals such as cockroaches, fruit flies, fishes or rodents. We argue that, due to their profound and persistent effects, early social deprivation or enrichment may be important determinants in shaping animal personalities. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

To quantify personality, the phenotypic variation of a behavioural trait is partitioned to assess how it varies among individuals, which is also known as repeatability. If pedigree data are available, the phenotypic variation can then be further partitioned to estimate the additive genetic variance and heritability. Assessing the repeatability and heritability of personality traits therefore allows for a better understanding of what natural selection can act upon, enabling evolution. In a natural population of facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, a lack of breeding vacancies forces individuals into different life-history strategies, and these differences in reproductive state could generate behavioural differences among individuals in the population. We used this population to estimate the repeatability of 4 behavioural traits (novel environment exploration, novel object exploration, obstinacy/struggle rate, and escape response), and narrow-sense heritability (of behavior, h(B)(2); behavior minus observer variance; and personality), and evolvability, of the repeatable behavioural traits. We also tested for an among-individual correlation between the repeatable traits. We found that, compared to estimates in other study species, the exploratory behaviours were moderately repeatable (0.23-0.37), there was a positive among-individual correlation (0.51) between novel environment and novel object exploration, and that novel environment exploration was moderately heritable (0.17; h(B)(2) was low as it includes observer variance).

Recently, the notion that life history studies should integrate animal behaviour has emerged, because between-individual differences in behaviour are often coupled with fitness differences. So far, studies have mainly focused on interspecies or interpopulation perspectives, and research on the effects of life history differences on individual behaviour remain scarce. In the present study we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how pace of life is related to consistent individual behaviour. We investigated the relationship between developmental speed and consistent behaviour of the field wolf spider, Pardosa agrestis. In this species, individuals originating from the same clutch can typically follow either a slow or a rapid developmental pathway, characterized by a developmental time of about 10 or 3 months, respectively. We found that spiders, regardless of their developmental speed, behaved consistently in most of the tests. Our results also show that individuals developing rapidly were significantly more active during exploration and more successful in prey-catching tests than slowly developing spiders. Although rapidly developing spiders were bolder in one of the tests, this difference did not persist over the repeated measurements. Our work seems to support the notion that pace of life and animal personality are correlated, and pace of life might predict the behavioural types of individuals.

Males adjusted their flight from the colony according to the amplitude (loudness) and Wiener entropy (harshness) of conspecific alarm calls during a perceived threat. Males also varied in how often they fled the colony. Specifically, in line with predictions based on the value of a male's territory, males with more nesting females were less likely to flee, and returned sooner if they did flee, compared to males with fewer nesting females. Males with a nest under construction also returned to their nests sooner than males without constructions in progress, consistent with predictions based on nest sabotage by conspecifics.

A key tenet of coping styles theory is that variation in coping styles is maintained by tradeoffs with behavioral flexibility: proactive individuals excel in stable environments while more flexible, reactive individuals perform better in variable environments. Here, we assess evidence for coping styles within a natural population of threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (NT) and Black-chinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron (BCT) are respectively characterized by fast growth and water salinity tolerance which attract the breeders who could take advantage of both species. The first step is to characterize both species behavior in different contexts. The aim of this study was to compare the self-feeding behaviour between NT and BCT with a design allowing to reveal individual and group feed demand behaviour and then to identify the individual specialization that builds around the device and the Mod dispenser. The second objective was to estimate the links between the individual specialization and personality traits. To this aim, we recorded feed demand behaviour of both species using a computerized self-feeding device (two tanks for each species containing 20 PIT-tagged individuals with a male-female ratio of about 47\%). Personality traits of all individuals were subsequently characterized with an open field test (OFT). The links between feed-demand and personality were then analyzed. Growth performances were not significantly different between NT and BCT but there was a strong tank effect. The individual specialization was similar in NT and BCT and,similar to that previously observed in sea bass i.e. 1-3 individuals responsible for most of the feed demand activity in the tanks. Most NT individuals stayed in the shelter during the open field test while most of BCT individuals moved out of it. Overall, NT were shyer than BCT or the OFT was not adapted to NT. Linking the results of the self-feeding experiment and OFT in BCT, we found a strong positive correlation between the triggering activity and females' shyness. Fish that spent more time inside than outside the shelter and which latency to emerge from shelter was longer, were characterized by a higher triggering activity (high-triggering fish). This study confirms the NT ability to use self-feeder devices and provides the first insight into the same ability in BCT and demonstrates links with personality traits.

In general, participation increased across testing sessions, yet patterns of participation differed with sex and body condition. Males with a high body condition were more likely to participate in early test sessions compared to males with a low body condition or females. While participation among males in high body condition was consistent across sessions, males with a low body condition and females, regardless of body condition, were more likely to participate in later, rather than earlier sessions.

In male Carpetan rock lizards (Iberolacerta cyreni), the provitamin D-3 component of femoral gland secretion acts as an honest signal in sexual communication. Further, vitamin D-3 has many important metabolic functions in reptiles. Therefore, by employing a factorial experiment with food (high vs. low) and vitamin D-3 (supplemented vs. control) treatments in wild-caught reproductive male I. cyreni, we tested whether changing labile components of individual state affected (i) behavioural consistency (the degree of between-individual difference) and (ii) behavioural type (mean behaviour). Animal personality in activity was present in all treatments; however, personality was present only in the high food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment in shelter use and it was present in all but the low food x placebo treatment in risk taking. Lizards (i) decreased activity in the high food treatment, (ii) increased shelter use in the vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment and (iii) increased risk taking in the low food x vitamin D-3 supplementation treatment. We conclude that short-term changes in individual state affect both behavioural consistency and behavioural type of reproductive male I. cyreni. Unfavourable conditions resulted in decreased behavioural consistency, while high-state individuals became less active in general. Individuals with high specific (vitamin D-3) but low general (energy reserves) state took higher risk. We discuss several evolutionary explanations for the reported patterns. Significance statement The evolutionary and developmental mechanisms resulting in consistent between-individual behavioural differences across time and situations (i.e. animal personality) are of high scientific interest. It has been recently proposed that links between individual state (e.g. how well-fed the individual is) and behaviour can maintain such between-individual differences even on an evolutionarily timescale. However, whether short-term state changes are able to affect animal personality in adults is an open question. In a manipulative experiment, we found that the amount of food and vitamin D-3 (known to increase physiological quality and attractiveness of male Carpetan rock lizards, I. cyreni) affected the expression of animal personality and the actual behavioural types of reproductive male Carpetan rock lizards.

Key in this regard is the, often untested, assumption that individual differences in (correlated) behaviours are maintained across contexts and over an individual's lifetime. Here, we tested this assumption, using a population of 30 captive male starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, a highly gregarious avian species. We repeatedly assayed novel environment exploration and different aspects of sociability towards a female conspecific, across seasonal contexts (spring and autumn) and across a 2-year period, which represents a substantial portion of a starling's life span. We found that, regardless of plasticity at the population level, both exploration behaviour and sociability traits investigated were moderately repeatable across seasons and years, with no significant differences between repeatability estimates over different timescales.

Populations of Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits. Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex, while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that fish caught from environments without predators and with probable intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes, relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours.

These differences are often triggered by variable individual responses to environmental stress factors experienced during life, such as competition for resources and risk of predation. While the causes underlying animal personality are considered to be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown whether personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we tested whether personality emerged and was strengthened during the lifetime of Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once intraspecific competition and risk of predation were completely removed and genetic and maternal differences minimized. We found that individual differences in behavior were overall repeatable over ontogeny (i.e., personality was manifested). Personality was, however, not detectable in juvenile individuals but emerged during and after their sexual maturation. The emergence of personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in behavior among individuals did not vary with age. Our results suggest that animal personality might be inevitable and emerge in fish under laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence of extrinsic factors that typically lead to behavioral differentiation. The decline of behavioral plasticity over lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for the development of personality in animals. Increasing evidence suggests that animals have personality, that is, individuals consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold and shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality differences among animals should be, by definition, consistent over time and often caused by environmental challenges experienced early in life. In this study, we observed that personality differences were not present at juvenile age in social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the fact that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and competition for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality differences strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines in individual behavioral plasticity.

Here, we investigated whether brown trout Salmo trutta adjust their behavior in relation to energetic status and body size during a major early-life selection bottleneck, when fast growth is important. Over two consecutive time periods (P1 and P2; 12 and 23 days, respectively), food availability was manipulated, using four different combinations of high (H) and low (L) rations (i.e., HH, HL, LH, and LL; first and second letter denoting ration during P1 and P2, respectively). Social effects were excluded through individual isolation. Following the treatment periods, fish in the HL treatment were on average 15-21 \% more active than the other groups in a forced open-field test, but large within-treatment variation provided only weak statistical support for this effect. Furthermore, fish on L-ration during P2 tended to be more actively aggressive towards their mirror image than fish on H-ration. Body size was related to behavioral expression, with larger fish being more active and aggressive. Swimming activity and active aggression were positively correlated, forming a behavioral syndrome in the studied population. Based on these behavioral traits, we could also distinguish two behavioral clusters: one consisting of more active and aggressive individuals and the other consisting of less active and aggressive individuals. This indicates that brown trout fry adopt distinct behavioral strategies early in life. This paper provides information on the state-dependence of behavior in animals, in particular young brown trout. On the one hand, our data suggest a weak energetic state feedback where activity and aggression is increased as a response to short term food restriction. This suggests a limited scope for behavioral alterations in the face of starvation. On the other hand, body size is linked to higher activity and aggression, likely as a positive feedback between size and dominance. The experiment was carried out during the main population survival bottleneck, and the results indicate that growth is important during this stage, as 1) behavioral compensation to increase growth is limited, and 2) growth likely increases the competitive ability. However, our data also suggests that the population separates into two clusters, based on combined scores of activity and aggression (which are positively linked within individuals).

Using behavioral and physiological parameters measured six times across a calendar year, we first quantified individual repeatability and, second, explored the correlations among these parameters that might indicate a coherent stress response. Finally, we analyzed the link between the stress response and individual body mass, a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality in roe deer. We found that the measured parameters were highly repeatable across seasons,-indicating that the individual stress response is consistent over time. Furthermore, there was considerable covariation among the stress response parameters, describing a proactivity-reactivity gradient at the individual level. Finally, proactive individuals had higher body mass than reactive individuals. We suggest that consistent individual differences in energy metabolism and physiology may promote consistent individual differences in behavioral traits, providing a mechanistic link between food acquisition tactics and demographic performance.

An individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum has many implications. Bold individuals may outperform shyer conspecifics during foraging as they cover more ground, accumulate information more rapidly and make more frequent food discoveries. Individual variation in boldness may also affect behavioural plasticity across environmental contexts, as the time to process new information, the ability to locate and memorise resources and the time and ability to apply prior information in a novel context all differ between individuals. The primary aim of the current study was to examine plasticity in, and covariation between, boldness, foraging speed and foraging accuracy across social foraging contexts. We showed that the stickleback that were shyest when foraging alone became relatively boldest when foraging in a social context and also delayed their entry to a known food patch the most in the presence of conspecifics. These results support the assertion that shyer foragers are more reactive to social cues and add to current knowledge of how an individual's position on the boldness-shyness continuum may correlate to foraging task performance and behavioural plasticity. We conclude that the correlation between boldness and behavioural plasticity may have broad relevance as the ability to adjust or retain behaviours in changing social environments could often have consequences for fitness. Animal personality may affect how much individuals change their behaviour to suit different environments. We studied the link between threespine stickleback personality (boldness or shyness), foraging performance and change in foraging performance when either alone or in the presence of other stickleback. We found that shyer threespine stickleback were more reactive to the presence of other fish when foraging. When observed or joined by other fish, shy stickleback started exploring earlier, but entered a known food patch later, than when alone.

For social organisms, the social context in which immigrants disperse across contrasting environments may have important implications for their viability post dispersal. Here, we use social spiders whose individual personalities as well as group personality compositions vary across sites to test whether the strength of selection against immigrants (i.e. mortality rates) differs depending on whether spiders are transplanted (1) as individuals and remain alone, (2) join pre-existing colonies at their new non-native environment, or (3) move with their native group. We also tested for an effect of individual personality on survival. We found that social context, and not individual personality, affects individual survival in foreign environments with contrasting resource levels. Individuals that were transplanted with their native groups suffered higher mortality rates compared to individuals transplanted as singletons, regardless of whether or not they were assimilated into native colonies. Moving as individuals could thus provide an avenue for ongoing gene flow among populations from different resource environments. We found no depressed performance of control colonies that were transplanted across sites with resource levels similar to each colony's site of origin. These results are at odds with the intuition that dispersing as a group should generally enhance the viability of immigrants, at least in social species. We propose that these results could be explained by a mismatch in the ideal group compositions (personality compositions) favoured in different environments, despite a lack of selection on individual personality traits.

In this study, we investigate animal personality based on the definition of personality traits as underlying dispositional factors, which are linked to biological internal factors that are stable and perhaps heritable. Although not directly measurable, these underlying dispositional factors predispose individuals to react through different behavioural patterns. We investigated the shyness-boldness continuum reflected in the consistency across time of the inter-individual variation in behavioural responses towards two different novelty tests: a novel object test representing non-social contexts and a mirror test representing social contexts. Our study animals were 60 farmed American mink (Neovison vison), which were raised in identical housing conditions. We recorded the approach behaviour of the mink towards novelty at two different times: the first time during non-breeding season in December 2013 and the second time during pre-breeding season in February 2014. Behavioural variables were analysed using principal component analyses and our results show consistency in inter individual variation in shyness measures across seasons. This consistency differed across non-social and social contexts forming two different shyness-boldness dimensions as were also found across context in a previous study. To our knowledge this is the first study to reveal aspects of the shyness-boldness continuum across time and season in the American mink from non-breeding season in December to pre-breeding season in February. Our study confirms the existence of personality in farmed American mink, but interestingly, we saw a shift in the positioning of most individuals from shy to more bold on the shyness continuum when comparing the December measures to the February measures.

This constrains the independent evolution of traits and can lead to unpredicted ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Animals might frequently exhibit genetic associations among behavioural and morphological-physiological traits, because the physiological mechanisms behind animal personality can have broad multitrait effects and because many selective agents influence the evolution of multiple types of traits. However, we currently know little about genetic correlations between animal personalities and nonbehavioural traits. We tested for associations between personality, morphology and locomotor performance by comparing zebrafish (Danio rerio) collected from the wild and then selectively bred for either a proactive or reactive stress coping style ('bold' or `shy' phenotypes). Based on adaptive hypotheses of correlational selection in the wild, we predicted that artificial selection for boldness would produce correlated evolutionary responses of larger caudal regions and higher fast-start escape performance (and the opposite for shyness). After four to seven generations, morphology and locomotor performance differed between personality lines: bold zebrafish exhibited a larger caudal region and higher fast-start performance than fish in the shy line, matching predictions. Individual-level phenotypic correlations suggested that pleiotropy or physical gene linkage likely explained the correlated response of locomotor performance, while the correlated response of body shape may have reflected linkage disequilibrium, which is breaking down each generation in the laboratory.

This variability comes from consistent differences in behavioral and physiological responses among individuals to a changing/challenging environment, named ``coping style{'' ``temperament{''} or ``personality{''}. Many studies have described how to characterize personality traits and how to assess their consistency over time and between different contexts; however, little is known about the environmental factors shaping personality development. Because contrasting personalities are maintained with evolution, this lead to the widespread assumption that genes play a predominant role in personality. In many cases, personality traits are however also likely to be determined by individual experience, which is probably at least as important as genetics in shaping personality. The aim of this study was to assess how environmental variability (herein food predictability) impacts behavioral responses, particularly the shyness-boldness axis, one of the most widely shared animal personality trait. Here, we reared juvenile seabass (95 days old) from two divergent strains selected for feed deprivation tolerance under standard conditions for 40 days. Thereafter, we submitted them to two feeding treatments (Predictable versus Unpredictable) starting at 135 dph and lasting 60 days. Seabass reared under a predictable food supply (PFS) grew faster and were shyer than fish reared under an unpredictable food supply (UFS) (i.e. they took more time to exit the refuge zone of a Z-maze; UFS: 132.47 +/- 34.63 s; PFS: 336.79 +/- 56.97 s) but their exploration tendency was similar. We also examined the behavioral responses of these fish facing a hypoxic challenge. Hypoxia tolerance results were consistent before and after the two feeding treatments. Our findings show the importance of early environmental experience as a driving force shaping boldness. In addition, we provide further evidence that predictable feeding time should be respected in studies assessing essential functions such as growth and behavior.

The study of personality differences across individuals within the same behavioral caste may contribute to an understanding of how social insects divide labor within the nest. Here, we define and investigate three dimensions of personality within the worker caste of a model social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera, as follows: (1) consistent individual behavioral differences over time, (2) consistent individual behavioral differences across contexts, and (3) the presence of correlated suites of behaviors. To test whether honey bee workers exhibit dimensions 1 and 2, we repeatedly assessed responses of groups of same-age bees in cages to stimuli that are relevant to bee life history. To test for dimension 3, we examined behavior within a colony context by using observation hives to record the behaviors of individual bees across their lifetimes. Our results provide some evidence for all three dimensions of personality in honey bee workers. In particular, our data suggest some individuals may be more likely to be highly interactive with other workers (e.g., engaging in food sharing), while other individuals are consistently less interactive. These findings expand upon and contribute to previous models for the organization of worker division of labor in honey bees, suggesting that consistent behavioral differences (personalities) of workers within a behavioral caste have the potential to contribute to subcaste division of labor. Significance statement Behavioral ecologists have become increasingly interested in animal personalities, individual behavioral differences that are consistent over time and in different contexts, with recent focus on understanding the occurrence of personalities across taxa and their adaptive value. The existence and function of personality differences among individuals in complex societies, such as eusocial insects, remain understudied. Here, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of whether workers of the highly eusocial honey bee show hallmarks of personality. Although these workers demonstrate well-documented behavioral changes as they age, we uncovered some aspects of their behavior, in particular, their tendency to physically interact with other bees, remain somewhat consistent even as they age and change roles within the colony. We suggest that individual-level personality differences have the potential to contribute to colony division of labor by creating variation in individual tendencies to perform different tasks.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,1

Here we investigated consistency and plasticity in movement behaviour of wild juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, by repeatedly subjecting sharks to open field tests. First, we investigated the presence of interindividual differences in movement behaviour in a novel open field. Second, we investigated the effect of trial repetition on movement behaviour to understand whether movement in a novel open field reflects a reaction to novelty, or general activity. Third, we estimated individual differences in habituation/sensitization rates over trial repetition and studied how the habituation rate was predicted by the initial movement rate. We found consistent individual differences in movement behaviour during the open field tests. Sharks showed habituation in movement behaviour (i.e. decrease) over repeated trials indicating that the movement behaviour during the first trials is a reaction to novelty, and not general activity. Individuals, however, differed in their rate of habituation (i.e. plasticity) and this rate was negatively related to an individual's movement behaviour in the first open field trial. In addition to showing individual differences in consistency and plasticity in juvenile lemon sharks, our study emphasizes the importance of examining the validity of personality tests when adapting them to new species.

Studying the relationship between behavior and other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) framework, which explains the integration of different traits using the concept of a fast-slow life-history continuum, may thus be a useful approach to understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personality. According to the POLS hypothesis, for example, fast individuals should be behaviorally more active, bolder or less sociable, and potentially invest more in reproduction than slow individuals. Here, we examined whether the sociability of juvenile sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is linked with their key reproductive traits, carotenoid-based nuptial coloration of males and egg production of females. We also tested whether experimental manipulation of environmental conditions (control vs. warm winter) can change pace-of-life and the link between behavioral and reproductive traits. Male sticklebacks prone to shoaling expressed lower peak red coloration at the reproductive stage, during which they were solitary and territorial. In females, fecundity was not correlated with early social behavior. Experimental sticklebacks reared in warm winter conditions decreased their investment in reproduction, but the negative relationship between sociability and sexual signal of males was maintained. Our results suggest that the POLS could partly explain the maintenance of personality under predation pressure or severe mating competition. In natural environments, any benefit to sociable male sticklebacks may be counterbalanced by the cost of growing less attractive. Why do animals vary in personality, and how is such variation maintained within a population? An interesting approach for understanding this is studying how personality traits are correlated with other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life framework. For the first time, our results show the link between sociability at the juvenile stage and the expression of sexual ornament during reproduction in male three-spined sticklebacks. Sociable juveniles may benefit from reduced predation risk, but they grow less attractive and this may reduce their mating success during reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between survival and reproduction may contribute to the maintenance of among-individual variation in behavior.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AST",NA,1

A key model system to study this variation in signal expression is birdsong. Yet, despite good ecological understanding of why song varies across time of day and season, much of the individual variation remains unexplained. Although some of the interindividual variation in singing depends on the quality or motivation of an individual, it can also vary with other characteristics. Because singing has been shown to vary with personality traits in specific contexts, personality is thus an important candidate to explain part of the variation in seasonal and daily singing. Using a personality-typed field population of great tits (Parus major), we here show that singing activity peaked at dawn during the fertile period of the females and that the association between male personality and singing activity depended on the reproductive stage of his mate; faster explorers significantly increased in singing activity during main periods of fertility and maternal investment (egg laying and incubation). Moreover, males with higher singing activity tended to raise more fledglings. Increased singing by faster explorers during key periods of female reproductive investment suggests that faster explorers are more responsive to changes in female reproductive stage, contrasting the general view that faster explorers are less responsive to environmental and social changes. Most importantly, these findings highlight that multiple factors including personality need to be integrated when assessing causes of variation of highly variable sexually selected signal traits.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,1

We found that colonies composed of a mixture of `bold' and `shy' personality types exhibited twice as much defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience with predators for `mixed' colonies than for either monotypic composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus, colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to determine which individual traits were associated with task participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level, with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making. Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting participation in any task.

Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of male personality. Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating preferences.

We examined here the behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge). We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies. We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage, and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important, because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on differences between males and females, probably indicating on differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging. Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,1

In particular, it has been suggested that in play animals learn to cope physically and emotionally with unexpected events. Given that the propensity to play varies greatly between conspecific individuals, such interindividual variability in playfulness may be associated with differences in the animals' future behaviour, a prediction that has rarely been tested. To investigate whether different levels of playfulness in juvenility indeed coincide with behavioural differences in later life, 30 female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to the following series of behavioural observations and tests: (1) quantification of juvenile play behaviour; (2) behavioural testing in paradigms that assess anxiety-like behaviour and exploratory locomotion in an unfamiliar environment; and (3) observation of spontaneous behaviour in the familiar home cage environment. Surprisingly, a high level of juvenile playfulness was predictive of high levels of state anxiety and low levels of exploratory locomotion in later life. While this relationship existed already in adolescence, it became even more prominent in adulthood. By contrast, no substantial differences between playful and less playful mice were found with respect to home cage behaviour. While these findings may reflect better coping abilities in novel and dangerous environments in those mice that played the most during juvenility, they may also argue for the existence of different types of mice. Thus, despite genetic homogeneity and identical housing environments, preferences for either local or global use of space were observed that indicate the emergence of individuality. Concerning animal welfare, our findings suggest that play may constitute a plausible welfare indicator at the population level, but is probably less meaningful for the individual.

Second, the fleeing responses were not influenced by temperature and third, regardless of temperature, all individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated nondangerous stimulus, indicating a capacity for individual learning.

Usually, the behavioural variability of an individual is smaller than the behavioural range of its species, but stable over time and contexts. This intraindividual consistency has been termed animal personality, and is found in a wide range of taxa. Personality types have various fitness and behavioural consequences. In particular, proactive individuals seem to perform better in most, but not all, learning tasks. Furthermore, personality types may also influence behavioural reaction towards the task at hand. For instance, in the literature, reactive individuals are expected to explore new environments more slowly, but to respond better to changes in their environment than proactive individuals. Here, we report the characterization of personality profiles in mallards over a period of 8 months, as well as their reactions towards a spatial-learning task. Mallards' exploration scores were repeatable both in novel environment and in novel object tests. Even though they did not differ in their baseline cortisol levels, fast-exploring birds had lower cortisol levels 30 min after the occurrence of a stressor than slow-exploring birds. Irrespective of their personality, all our birds successfully learned to find a food location within a maze. Yet, fast-exploring individuals took longer to accomplish the task, potentially because they habituated faster to stress and could engage earlier in other activities within the maze. Our results contrast with recent views of the respective consequences of being reactive or proactive. They thus highlight the importance of considering the habituation to stress when investigating the relative advantages of the reactive - proactive continuum, as well as taking into account the personality bias when conducting cognitive experiments.

Yet, to date we have limited knowledge on how space use other than dispersal depends on BT. To address this question we studied BT-dependent space-use patterns of sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in southern Australia. We combined high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) tracking of 72 free-ranging lizards with repeated behavioural assays, and with a survey of the spatial distributions of their food and refuge resources. Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed that lizards responded to the spatial distribution of resources at the neighbourhood scale and to the intensity of space use by other conspecifics (showing apparent conspecific avoidance). BT (especially aggressiveness) affected space use by lizards and their response to ecological and social factors, in a seasonally dependent manner. Many of these effects and interactions were stronger later in the season when food became scarce and environmental conditions got tougher. For example, refuge and food availability became more important later in the season and unaggressive lizards were more responsive to these predictors.

Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory and bold behaviours are associated with polymorphisms in both DRD4 and SERT.

Responding to rival presence with an audience effect bears the risk of losing the initially preferred female, which may swim away, but may help to reduce sperm competition intensity. Males may rate this risk-benefit ratio differentially depending on their personality, for example, more risk-taking (bolder) males might be more likely to respond to an audience. Using Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana) as our study organism, we characterized focal and audience males along the boldness-activity behavioral axis. As overall competition levels are known to affect male mate choice, we subjected half of the males to a low competition (single-male housing) and the other half to a high-competition treatment (group housing) before they were tested in binary mate choice tests. Only males from the high competition treatment responded to rival presence with an audience effect. In congruence with our prediction, bolder males within this cohort showed a stronger audience effect. Our study exemplifies that (depending on the social context) bolder, not shyer, individuals can be more responsive to their social environment.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes","both","To test for significant among-individual variation (i.e., personality) within each treatment and to test whether males from both treatments differed in this variation, we fitted another LMM [...] Because we scaled the total variance to 1 within each treatment, estimates for Vamong equal the behavioral repeatability, that is, the proportion of total variation that can be attributed to among individual differences in repeated measures data [...] Males differed consistently in their individual activity levels in both SCI treatments as indicated by significant deviation of Vamong (repeatability) from zero (Table 1a; Figure 2b,c).

Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity(chamber)) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activity(mesocosm)) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activity(mesocosm) and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activity(chamber). After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activity(mesocosm), supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves.

Behavior is often the most flexible aspect of the phenotype, and to understand how it is affected by selection, we need to examine how consistent individuals are. However, it is not well understood whether among-individual differences tend to remain consistent over lifetimes, or whether the behavior of individuals relative to one another varies over time.

Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which suggests that prosocial traits may be ``reactively heritable{'' by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.","yes",NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"out of topic","MM",NA,1

For complex societies, there is considerable interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals' participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition, group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size: larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size, morphological composition and personality composition; none of these effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics.

Inland recreational fisheries offer unique opportunities for the study of fisheries induced evolution due to the ability to replicate study systems, limited gene flow among populations, and the existence of unexploited reference populations. Experimental research has demonstrated that angling vulnerability is heritable in Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, and is correlated with elevated resting metabolic rates (RMR) and higher fitness. However, whether such differences are present in wild populations is unclear. This study sought to quantify differences in RMR among replicated exploited and unexploited populations of Largemouth Bass. We collected age-0 Largemouth Bass from two Connecticut drinking water reservoirs unexploited by anglers for almost a century, and two exploited lakes, then transported and reared them in the same pond. Field RMR of individuals from each population was quantified using intermittent-flow respirometry. Individuals from unexploited reservoirs had a significantly higher mean RMR (6\%) than individuals from exploited populations. These findings are consistent with expectations derived from artificial selection by angling on Largemouth Bass, suggesting that recreational angling may act as an evolutionary force influencing the metabolic rates of fishes in the wild. Reduced RMR as a result of fisheries induced evolution may have ecosystem level effects on energy demand, and be common in exploited recreational populations globally.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AST",NA,1

Fifty five percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish.

We investigated the balance between individual consistency and flexibility in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus by assaying boldness across the diel cycle and correlating these data with patterns of prey and threat abundance in the natural habitat.

Here, we explored if risk-taking and exploration were consistent and linked to different ecologically relevant traits in wild-caught adult male European green lizards (Lacerta viridis) and in their 2-3 weeks old laboratory-reared offspring. Both adults and juveniles displayed animal personality, consistency being higher in juveniles. We found correlation between risk-taking and exploration (suggestive of a behavioural syndrome) only in adults. Juveniles were more explorative than adults. Large or ectoparasite-free adult males were more explorative than small or parasitized males. Juvenile females tended to be more risk-taking than males. Behaviour of fathers and their offspring did not correlate. We conclude that European green lizards show high behavioural consistency and age is an important determinant of its strength and links to traits likely affecting fitness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the presence of highly interactive individuals, or hubs, influences the extent and rate of information spread across a network. In a network of interactions, the duration over which individual variation in interactions persists may affect how the network operates. Individuals may persist in their behavior over time and across situations, often referred to as personality. Colonies of social insects are an example of a biological system in which the structure of the coordinated networks of interacting workers may greatly influence information flow within the colony, and therefore its collective behavior. Here I investigate the effects of persistence in walking patterns on interaction networks using computer simulations that are parameterized using observed behavior of harvester ants. I examine how the duration of persistence in spatial behavior influences network structure. Furthermore, I explore how spatial features of the environment affect the relationship between persistent behavior and network structure. I show that as persistence increases, the skewness of the weighted degree distribution of the interaction network increases. However, this relationship holds only when ants are confined in a space with boundaries, but not when physical barriers are absent. These findings suggest that the influence of animal personalities on network structure and function depends on the environment in which the animals reside","yes",NA,"no","Simulation model",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PN",NA,1

We asked (1) whether activity could be considered to be a personality trait, (2) whether this trait is connected to survival, and (3) whether personality and survival exhibit sex differences. We found that activity fulfilled the criteria of personality as individuals had consistent between-individual differences over time and across situations. Consistent individual differences in activity were associated with fitness as the survival probability of active individuals was lower, but this did not depend on sex. Our results demonstrate that personality exists in I. balthica and support recent suggestions that the association between personality and life-history traits is a central component in mediating animal personality.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Repeatability measured using a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA and correlations.","AST",NA,1

For mammals, mother's milk is an important physiological pathway for nutrient transfer and glucocorticoid signaling that potentially influences offspring growth and behavioral phenotype. Glucocorticoids in mother's milk have been associated with offspring behavioral phenotype in several mammals, but studies have been handicapped by not simultaneously evaluating milk energy density and yield. This is problematic as milk glucocorticoids and nutrients likely have simultaneous effects on offspring phenotype. We investigated mother's milk and infant temperament and growth in a cohort of rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant dyads at the California National Primate Research Center (N = 108). Glucocorticoids in mother's milk, independent of available milk energy, predicted a more Nervous, less Confident temperament in both sons and daughters. We additionally found sex differences in the windows of sensitivity and the magnitude of sensitivity to maternal-origin glucocorticoids. Lower parity mothers produced milk with higher cortisol concentrations. Lastly, higher cortisol concentrations in milk were associated with greater infant weight gain across time. Taken together, these results suggest that mothers with fewer somatic resources, even in captivity, may be ``programming{''} through cortisol signaling, behaviorally cautious offspring that prioritize growth. Glucocorticoids ingested through milk may importantly contribute to the assimilation of available milk energy, development of temperament, and orchestrate, in part, the allocation of maternal milk energy between growth and behavioral phenotype.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes","within","Cortisol concentrations in milk were highly variable across individuals (Table 1) and, to a lesser extent, across time within individual (intraclass correlation = 0.58, confidence interval: 0.45–0.71, N = 108, Figure 1).

A systematic procedure for categorizing behavioral assays",2015,"BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES",110,NA,"117-124","McGarrity, Monica E. and Sinn, David L. and Gosling, Samuel D.","10.1016/j.beproc.2014.09.029","With the recent increase in interest in personality in dogs, behavioral assays of their behavior have proliferated. There has been particularly strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we used an `expert-categorization' procedure a standardized method often used in the course of meta-analyses to identify the subset of those assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity, aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration, fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness, trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a standardized categorization procedure undertaken.independently by six expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test batteries.

However, individuals often differ consistently from one another in how they cope with their environment, a phenomenon known as animal personality, which may affect how individuals use coordination rules and requiring them to compromise. Here we tracked the movements of pairs of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, separated by a transparent partition that allowed them to observe and interact with one another in a context containing cover. Individuals differed consistently in their tendency to approach their partner's compartment during collective movements. The strength of this social attraction was positively correlated with the behavioural coordination between members of a pair but was negatively correlated with an individual's tendency to lead. Social attraction may form part of a broader behavioural syndrome as it was predicted by the boldness of an individual, measured in isolation prior to the observation of pairs, and by the boldness of the partner. We found that bolder fish, and those paired with bolder partners, tended to approach their partner's compartment less closely. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms that govern the dynamics and functioning of social groups and the emergence and maintenance of consistent behavioural differences.

Although simple assays of the type commonly used to study animal personality have been shown to correlate with social aggressiveness in some bird species, conflicting empirical results do not yet make it clear when such assays, typically using isolated individuals, predict behaviour within social groups. We measured aggressiveness in groups of a very gregarious species, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), and performed five commonly used behavioural assays on the same individuals: tonic immobility, mirror test, novel object test, open-field test and a variant of the latter in an enriched environment. We found that larger individuals were more dominant and that differences in aggressiveness were repeatable. None of the traditional behavioural assays were related to aggressiveness or dominance. Standard personality assays may fail to capture individual differences relevant to predict social behaviour, and we discuss biological and methodological explanations for these results, such as social behaviour being in part an emergent property of groups rather than an intrinsic property of individuals, or gregarious species being particularly sensitive to the conditions of standard personality assays that test individuals alone.","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes","both","""We then estimated within-individual repeatability"", ""consistent differences in aggressiveness among individual waxbills"", ""repeatable behavioural differences among individuals""","yes","""consistent differences in aggressiveness among individual waxbills""","no",NA,NA,"no",NA,"PN","no",1
