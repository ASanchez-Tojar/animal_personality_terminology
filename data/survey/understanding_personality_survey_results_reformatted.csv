I'm currently working on a review of how animal personality has been applied to conservation biology. Have you published a review on/how you got to your definitions of animal personality because, I've seen a few more than what you have listed. However I think the one I selected while being the most broad is the most accurate. Nice survey, hope to hear the results soon.

For Q1, I feel the intercept of a reaction norm functions as an accurate statistical definition (how do we measure ""personality"" in practice), but not as a biological one. The key biological criteria for me are that individuals are distinct in their behavioral averages for the same trait (implies repeated measurements). I am fine with the Sih et al. 2004 definition (“Consistent between-individual differences in behaviour across time and/or contexts”), but since this was proposed as a definition of behavioral syndromes and not personality, the “across time/or context” leads to a lot of confusion. Regarding Q2, intuitively, I feel that if individuals differ in their averages, this implies limited individual plasticity (no individual can express the full range of behaviors). I think there could possibly be cases where differences in average behaviors could be detected while substantial within-individual variance is present, but the repeatabilities would probably be very weak in this case, so talking about “personalities” may not even make much sense in this context. For Q3, assuming the classic definition of repeatability (Vi/(Vi+Vw)), high repeatability, implies low within-individual variances. But within-individual variance only capture reversible plasticity. I therefore ruled answer c out. Things get more complex if we factor in the variance explained by fixed effects as part of the denominator, so it really depends on how this ratio is calculated in the first place! Q4: I’d say repeatability is one of many estimate of behavioral consistency, but mean-standardized estimates (CV, I) and coefficient of variation in predictability from DHGLM approach are probably better in answering whether individuals are truly distinct in their behavioral tendencies. These latter estimates have more restriction than repeatability however and are harder to implement in practice.
